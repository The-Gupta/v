This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of CLABSI and the effectiveness of antimicrobial lock therapy (ALT) in pediatric patients. METHODS: BSIs of all pediatric hematology-oncology patients admitted to a children's hospital between January 2009 and December 2013 were reviewed. The United States National Healthcare Safety Network and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines were used to define CLABSI and catheter-related BSI (CRBSI). The incidence, laboratory and microbiology characteristics, poor outcome, and effectiveness of ALT were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 246 cases of CLABSI in 146 patients (mean age, 10.0 years), including 66 (26.8%) cases of CRBSI. The incidence of CLABSI was 4.49/1000 catheter-days, and the infection was responsible for 32.9% of the complications these patients developed and 9.3% of contributable mortality. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia had the highest infection density (5.36/1000 patient-days). Enterobacteriaceae (40.2%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 20.7%) were the predominant pathogens. In multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, elevated C-reactive protein, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and candidemia were associated with poor outcome. The success rate of ALT was 58.6% (17/29) for the treatment of CoNS and 78.3% (29/37) for Enterobacteriaceae infections. Patients with candidemia (n = 18) had the highest mortality (33.4%) and catheter removal rate (66.7%). Chlorhexidine as the disinfectant decreased the 1-year CLABSI rate from 13.7/1000 to 8.4/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: CoNS and Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in CLABSI among pediatric hematology-oncology patients. ALT is effective and showed no significant side effect. New disinfection practice and infection control measures can decrease CLABSI.","['Tsai, Hsing-Chen', 'Huang, Li-Min', 'Chang, Luan-Yin', 'Lee, Ping-Ing', 'Chen, Jong-Ming', 'Shao, Pei-Lan', 'Hsueh, Po-Ren', 'Sheng, Wang-Huei', 'Chang, Yu-Ching', 'Lu, Chun-Yi']","['Tsai HC', 'Huang LM', 'Chang LY', 'Lee PI', 'Chen JM', 'Shao PL', 'Hsueh PR', 'Sheng WH', 'Chang YC', 'Lu CY']","['Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, New Taipei City Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nursing, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

Although the role of U2AF1 as an accessory factor in the U2 snRNP is well established, it is not yet clear how these mutations affect splicing or contribute to MDS pathophysiology. We analyzed splice junctions in RNA-seq data generated from transfected CD34+ hematopoietic cells and found significant differences in the abundance of known and novel junctions in samples expressing mutant U2AF1 (S34F). For selected transcripts, splicing alterations detected by RNA-seq were confirmed by analysis of primary de novo MDS patient samples. These effects were not due to impaired U2AF1 (S34F) localization as it co-localized normally with U2AF2 within nuclear speckles. We further found evidence in the RNA-seq data for decreased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for uridine (relative to cytidine) at the e-3 position immediately upstream of the splice acceptor site and corroborated this finding using affinity-binding assays. These data suggest that the S34F mutation alters U2AF1 function in the context of specific RNA sequences, leading to aberrant alternative splicing of target genes, some of which may be relevant for MDS pathogenesis.","['Okeyo-Owuor, T', 'White, B S', 'Chatrikhi, R', 'Mohan, D R', 'Kim, S', 'Griffith, M', 'Ding, L', 'Ketkar-Kulkarni, S', 'Hundal, J', 'Laird, K M', 'Kielkopf, C L', 'Ley, T J', 'Walter, M J', 'Graubert, T A']","['Okeyo-Owuor T', 'White BS', 'Chatrikhi R', 'Mohan DR', 'Kim S', 'Griffith M', 'Ding L', 'Ketkar-Kulkarni S', 'Hundal J', 'Laird KM', 'Kielkopf CL', 'Ley TJ', 'Walter MJ', 'Graubert TA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA [2] The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA [2] The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141014,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Precursors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Splicing Factor U2AF', 'Transfection']",,,2014/10/15 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014303 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.303 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):909-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.303.

MYC and NOTCH1 contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. NOTCH induces MYC, connecting two signaling programs that enhance oncogenicity. Here we show that this relationship is bidirectional and that MYC, via a miRNA intermediary, modulates NOTCH. MicroRNA-30a (miR-30a), a member of a family of miRNAs that are transcriptionally suppressed by MYC, directly binds to and inhibits NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 expression. Using a murine model and genetically modified human cell lines, we confirmed that miR-30a influences NOTCH expression in a MYC-dependent fashion. In turn, through genetic modulation, we demonstrated that intracellular NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, by inducing MYC, suppressed miR-30a. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH decreased MYC expression and ultimately de-repressed miR-30a. Examination of genetic models of gain and loss of miR-30a in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells suggested a tumor-suppressive role for this miRNA. Finally, the activity of the miR-30a-NOTCH-MYC loop was validated in primary DLBCL and T-ALL samples. These data define the presence of a miRNA-mediated regulatory circuitry that may modulate the oncogenic signals originating from NOTCH and MYC.","['Ortega, M', 'Bhatnagar, H', 'Lin, A-P', 'Wang, L', 'Aster, J C', 'Sill, H', 'Aguiar, R C T']","['Ortega M', 'Bhatnagar H', 'Lin AP', 'Wang L', 'Aster JC', 'Sill H', 'Aguiar RC']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', ""1] Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA [2] Cancer Therapy and Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA [3] Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA [4] South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie Murphy VA Hospital, San Antonio, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141014,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MIRN30b microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",,,2014/10/15 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/15 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014302 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.302 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):968-76. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.302.

In addition to their classical role in transport, a subset of Nups has a conserved role in the regulation of transcription via direct binding to chromatin. The molecular details of this function remain obscure, and it is unknown how metazoan Nups are recruited to their chromatin locations or what transcription steps they regulate. Here, we demonstrate genome-wide and physical association between Nup98 and histone-modifying complexes MBD-R2/NSL [corrected] and Trx/MLL. Importantly, we identify a requirement for MBD-R2 in recruitment of Nup98 to many of its genomic target sites. Consistent with its interaction with the Trx/MLL complex, Nup98 is shown to be necessary for Hox gene expression in developing fly tissues. These findings introduce roles of Nup98 in epigenetic regulation that may underlie the basis of oncogenicity of Nup98 fusions in leukemia.","['Pascual-Garcia, Pau', 'Jeong, Jieun', 'Capelson, Maya']","['Pascual-Garcia P', 'Jeong J', 'Capelson M']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Penn Epigenetics Program, University of Pennsylvania, 9-101 Smilow Center for Translational Research, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Penn Epigenetics Program, University of Pennsylvania, 9-101 Smilow Center for Translational Research, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Penn Epigenetics Program, University of Pennsylvania, 9-101 Smilow Center for Translational Research, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Among the 25 T-PLLs diagnosed between 1990 and 2013 at our institution, 32% (8/25) showed cutaneous manifestations, presenting as rash, purpura, papules, and ulcers. The skin biopsies showed leukemia cutis with perivascular and periadnexal irregular, small to medium-sized lymphoid infiltrates without epidermotropism. The lymphoid infiltrates were composed of mature CD4+ T cells expressing other T-cell antigens, and a subset (48%) showed dual CD4+/CD8+ coexpression. Higher median absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count (43.0 vs. 13.0 k/mm; P=0.031) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (P=0.00018) at the time of diagnosis were significantly associated with T-PLLs with skin involvement compared with those without. The extent of bone marrow involvement (P=0.849) and overall survival (P=0.144) was similar in the 2 groups. Fluorescence in situ hybridization or karyotype revealed frequent gains of MYC (67%; n=9), loss of ATM (64%; n=11), and TCL1A rearrangement or inversion 14q (75%; n=12). Gains of TCL1A was also seen (78%; n=9), including in some cases that had concurrent TCL1A rearrangement, whereas TP53 loss was less common (30%; n=10). No correlation was seen between the immunophenotype and morphology versus the presence or absence of skin involvement. These data suggest that cutaneous involvement by T-PLL is relatively common and often associated with significant peripheral blood involvement. The frequent MYC, ATM, and TCL1A alterations identified support that these genes are integral to the pathogenesis of T-PLL.","['Hsi, Andy C', 'Robirds, Diane H', 'Luo, Jingqin', 'Kreisel, Friederike H', 'Frater, John L', 'Nguyen, TuDung T']","['Hsi AC', 'Robirds DH', 'Luo J', 'Kreisel FH', 'Frater JL', 'Nguyen TT']","['Departments of *Pathology daggerBiostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Missouri', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000272 [doi]', '00000478-201411000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2014 Nov;38(11):1468-83. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000272.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study demonstrated that genistein inhibited the expression of cytoplasmic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (cICDH), thus increasing levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human promyeloid leukemia HL60 cells. In genisteintreated cells, the cellular redox potential (GSH/GSSG) was significantly decreased. This decrease in redox potential was caused by significant downregulation of the cICDH gene, generating the reducing equivalents (NADPH) for maintenance of cellular redox potential and cellular ROS level, which may regulate cell growth and cell death. Genisteininduced ROS partially induced rapid transition into the G2/M phase by upregulation of p21wap1/cip1 and apoptotic cell death. Treatment of cells with Nacetylcysteine, a wellknown antioxidant (ROS scavenger), not only partially restored cell growth and inhibited cell cycle arrest in G2/M, but also prevented apoptotic cell death. By contrast, normal lymphocytes did not significantly progress into the G2/M phase and radiationinduced cell death was inhibited by genistein treatment. Therefore, genistein and gammairradiation together synergistically cause cell death in leukemia cells, however, genistein has a radioprotective effect in normal human lymphocytes. In conclusion, it was suggested that genistein selectively functions, not as an antioxidant, but as a prooxidant in HL60 cells. This property can increase ionizing radiationinduced cell cycle arrest and sensitivity to apoptotic cell death in human promyeloid leukemia HL60 cells, but does not cause significant damage to normal cells.","['Kim, In Gyu', 'Kim, Jin Sik', 'Lee, Jae Ha', 'Cho, Eun Wie']","['Kim IG', 'Kim JS', 'Lee JH', 'Cho EW']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Environment Radiation Research Group, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Yuseong, Daejeon 305600, Republic of Korea.', 'Bioconvergence Department, Korea Conformity Laboratories, Yoensugu, Incheon 406840, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Environment Radiation Research Group, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Yuseong, Daejeon 305600, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Translational Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Yuseonggu, Daejeon 305806, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gamma Rays/therapeutic use', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/06/20 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2014.2611 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2014 Dec;10(6):2786-92. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2014.2611.

Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors alone appear to make a relatively minor contribution to disease risk. The polygenic nature of childhood ALL predisposition together with the timing of environmental triggers may hold vital clues for disease etiology. This study presents results from an Australian GWAS of childhood ALL cases (n = 358) and population controls (n = 1192). Furthermore, we utilised family trio (n = 204) genotypes to extend our investigation to gene-environment interaction of significant loci with parental exposures before conception, and child's sex and age. Thirteen SNPs achieved genome wide significance in the population based case/control analysis; ten annotated to ARID5B and three to IKZF1. The most significant SNPs in these regions were ARID5B rs4245595 (OR 1.63, CI 1.38-1.93, P = 2.13x10(-9)), and IKZF1 rs1110701 (OR 1.69, CI 1.42-2.02, p = 7.26x10(-9)). There was evidence of gene-environment interaction for risk genotype at IKZF1, whereby an apparently stronger genetic effect was observed if the mother took folic acid or if the father did not smoke prior to pregnancy (respective interaction P-values: 0.04, 0.05). There were no interactions of risk genotypes with age or sex (P-values >0.2). Our results evidence that interaction of genetic variants and environmental exposures may further alter risk of childhood ALL however, investigation in a larger population is required.

With the advent of modern healthcare support, the 5-year survival rate has been impressive in the recent past. However, long-term ALL survivors embattle several treatment-related medical and socio-economic complications due to excessive and inordinate chemotherapy doses received during treatment. In this work, we present a model-based approach to personalize 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) treatment for childhood ALL with a provision for incorporating the pharmacogenomic variations among patients. Semi-mechanistic mathematical models were developed and validated for i) 6-MP metabolism, ii) red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) dynamics, a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy, and iii) leukopenia, a major side-effect. With the constraint of getting limited data from clinics, a global sensitivity analysis based model reduction technique was employed to reduce the parameter space arising from semi-mechanistic models. The reduced, sensitive parameters were used to individualize the average patient model to a specific patient so as to minimize the model uncertainty. Models fit the data well and mimic diverse behavior observed among patients with minimum parameters. The model was validated with real patient data obtained from literature and Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Patient models were used to optimize the dose for an individual patient through nonlinear model predictive control. The implementation of our approach in clinical practice is realizable with routinely measured complete blood counts (CBC) and a few additional metabolite measurements. The proposed approach promises to achieve model-based individualized treatment to a specific patient, as opposed to a standard-dose-for-all, and to prescribe an optimal dose for a desired outcome with minimum side-effects.","['Jayachandran, Devaraj', 'Rundell, Ann E', 'Hannemann, Robert E', 'Vik, Terry A', 'Ramkrishna, Doraiswami']","['Jayachandran D', 'Rundell AE', 'Hannemann RE', 'Vik TA', 'Ramkrishna D']","['School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, United States of America.', 'School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, United States of America; Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141013,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Erythrocyte Indices/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', '*Patient-Specific Modeling', '*Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Survivors']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109623 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-07911 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 13;9(10):e109623. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109623. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4195683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrated that the WT1 gene was commonly expressed in leukemic cell lines apart from U937 cells. The K562 cell line which expresses WT1 at a high level (mRNA and protein) was used in the entire experiment. By MTT and colony formation assays, we found that curcumin, an inhibitor of the WT1 protein, inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It also caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. We then designed specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) which could downregulate WT1 by 70-80% at the mRNA and protein levels. Reduction in the WT1 levels attenuated the proliferative ability and clonogenicity. Cell cycle progression analysis indicated that the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase increased while the proportion in the S phase decreased distinctively. ChIP-DNA selection and ligation (DSL) experiment identified a cohort of genes whose promoters are targeted by WT1. These genes were classified into different cellular signaling pathways using MAS software and included the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, apoptosis pathway, and the cell cycle. We focused on the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and compared expression of several genes in the K562 cells transfected with the control shRNA and WT1-specific shRNA. beta-catenin, an important gene in the Wnt canonical pathway, was downregulated after WT1 RNAi. Target genes of beta-catenin which participate in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation, such as CCND1 and MYC, were also significantly downregulated. Collectively, these data suggest that WT1 functions as an oncogene in leukemia cells, and one important mechanism is regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.","['Li, Yan', 'Wang, Jiying', 'Li, Xiaoyan', 'Jia, Yujiao', 'Huai, Lei', 'He, Kan', 'Yu, Pei', 'Wang, Min', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Rao, Qing', 'Tian, Zhen', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Mi, Yingchang']","['Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Li X', 'Jia Y', 'Huai L', 'He K', 'Yu P', 'Wang M', 'Xing H', 'Rao Q', 'Tian Z', 'Tang K', 'Wang J', 'Mi Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, P.R.

The average number of DLI per patient was 2.6 (range, 1-6). The diagnosis was leukemias (n=32) grafted with a myeloablative regimen and Hodgkin's disease (n=10), grafted with a nonmyeloablative regimen. Leukemic patients with molecular relapse (n=20), received DLI alone (n=17) or in association with azacytidine (n=3); leukemic patients with hematologic relapse (n=12) received chemotherapy followed by DLI (n=11) or DLI alone (n=1); Hodgkin patients received DLI following 1-3 courses of chemotherapy. In these three groups the incidence of acute GVHD II-III was 15%, 17% and 10%; response rate was 45%, 33% and 70%; 2-year actuarial survival was 43%, 19% and 80% respectively.

Between July 2008 and January 2013, 28 patients underwent ex vivo T-cell-depleted HHCT; 9 had hematologic malignancy, 18 had nonmalignant hematologic disease, and 1 had refractory neuroblastoma. Twenty-six patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 11 days (range, 9-15 days). Two patients failed to achieve primary engraftment and five experienced graft rejection after primary engraftment. These seven patients achieved stable engraftment after a second HHCT. The cumulative incidences (CIs) ofgrade II andgrade III acute GVHD were 33.3% and 14.3%, respectively, and the 1-year CI of extensive chronic GVHD was 11.1%. Four patients died of non-relapse-related causes (two of CMV disease, one of encephalopathy and one of autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and one of leukemia relapse. Non-relapse mortality at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years was 0.0%, 10.7% and 14.3%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 32.8 months (range, 17.0-72.5 months), the 2-year OS was 82.1%. OSs for nonmalignant diseases and malignant diseases were 94.4% and 60.0%, respectively (P=0.019).

It is the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in developing countries. Dysregulated activation of genes, such as CD44, SOX9 and SKP2, plays a role in cervical cancer. CD38 is known to be involved in activities typical of cell surface receptors, such as signaling for activation and proliferation events and heterotypic cell adhesion. CD38 contributes to disease progression and relapse in certain tumors, such as acute myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no report on the relationship between CD38 and cervical cancer. Using qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis, the expression levels of CD38 were investigated and found to be upregulated in cervical cancer. CD38 was correlated with dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in cervical cancer tissues in vitro. At the same time, CD38 overexpression affected the expression of PI3K, Akt, MDM2 and p53 in vivo. The results of the present study suggested that CD38 is highly expressed in cervical carcinoma tissues and play an important role in dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","['Liao, Shan', 'Xiao, Songshu', 'Zhu, Guangchao', 'Zheng, Danwei', 'He, Junyu', 'Pei, Zhen', 'Li, Guiyuan', 'Zhou, Yanhong']","['Liao S', 'Xiao S', 'Zhu G', 'Zheng D', 'He J', 'Pei Z', 'Li G', 'Zhou Y']","['Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital and The Tumor Hospital Affiliated to Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, P.R.

Most patients with BPDCN have skin lesions and simultaneous involvement of the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. METHODS: A search of PubMed and Medline was conducted for English-written articles relating to BPDCN, CD4(+)CD56(+) hematodermic neoplasm, and blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Data regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: BPDCN is derived from precursor plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The diagnosis of BPDCN is based on the characteristic cytology and immunophenotype of malignant cells coexpressing CD4, CD56, CD123, blood dendritic cell antigens 2 and 4, and CD2AP markers. Multiple chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations previously reported in patients with myeloid and selected lymphoid neoplasms were identified in approximately 60% of patients with BPDCN. Prospectively controlled studies to guide treatment decisions are lacking. The overall response rate with aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type induction regimens was as high as 90%, but the durability of response was short. Median survival rates ranged between 12 and 16 months. Patients with relapsed disease may respond to L-asparaginase-containing regimens. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, particularly when performed during the first remission, may produce durable remissions in selected adults. CONCLUSIONS: BPDCN is a rare aggressive disease that typically affects elderly patients. The most commonly affected nonhematopoietic organ is the skin. Although BPDCN is initially sensitive to conventional chemotherapy regimens, this response is relatively short and long-term prognosis is poor. In the near future, novel targeted therapies may improve outcomes for patients with BPDCN.","['Riaz, Wasif', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Horna, Pedro', 'Sokol, Lubomir']","['Riaz W', 'Zhang L', 'Horna P', 'Sokol L']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

This study investigated MRE11 status and its association with prognosis, survival and drug response in patients with stage III colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 (Alliance) randomly assigned 1,264 patients with stage III colon cancer to postoperative weekly adjuvant bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FU/LV) or irinotecan+FU/LV (IFL), with 8 year follow-up. Tumors from these patients were analyzed to determine stability of a T11 tract in the MRE11 gene. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and a secondary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Non-proportional hazards were addressed using time-dependent covariates in Cox analyses. RESULTS: Of 625 tumor cases examined, 70 (11.2%) exhibited contraction at the T11 tract in one or both MRE11 alleles and were thus predicted to be deficient in MRE11 (dMRE11). In pooled treatment analyses, dMRE11 patients showed initially reduced DFS and OS but improved long-term DFS and OS compared with patients with an intact MRE11 T11 tract. In the subgroup of dMRE11 patients treated with IFL, an unexplained early increase in mortality but better long-term DFS than IFL-treated pMRE11 patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of this relatively small number of patients and events showed that the dMRE11 marker predicts better prognosis independent of treatment in the long-term. In subgroup analyses, dMRE11 patients treated with irinotecan exhibited unexplained short-term mortality. MRE11 status is readily assayed and may therefore prove to be a useful prognostic marker, provided that the results reported here for a relatively small number of patients can be generalized in independent analyses of larger numbers of samples.

We investigated the expression level of FOXM1 in patients with untreated acute leukemia (AL) and explored the correlation between expression levels and AL type. The relationship between the expression of the genes FOXM1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was determined after treatment of ML-2 cells with thiostrepton. The apoptosis, proliferation and cell-cycle progression of ML-2 lines were examined after treatment with metformin. We found that FOXM1 is expressed in the majority of AL patients and that its expression level was associated with the AL type. Thiostrepton is a specific inhibitor of FOXM1, and by inhibiting the FOXM1 expression via thiostrepton, we observed downregulatiion of mTOR; a significant correlation between FOXM1 and mTOR levels was observed. Thus, metformin may be involved in the downregulation of FOXM1. In addition, our study demonstrated that metformin promotes the apoptosis of ML-2 cells, induces cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, and inhibits proliferation. The potential role of FOXM1 in tumorigenesis renders it an attractive target for anticancer therapy, and metformin may represent a new agent for the treatment of leukemia.","['Zhang, Bing', 'Liu, Long-Long', 'Mao, Xia', 'Zhang, Dong-Hua']","['Zhang B', 'Liu LL', 'Mao X', 'Zhang DH']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, P.R.

25309961,NLM,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,,20211021,,1,,2013 Feb 20,The DN2 Myeloid-T (DN2mt) Progenitor is a Target Cell for Leukemic Transformation by the TLX1 Oncogene.,,105 [pii],"INTRODUCTION: Inappropriate activation of the TLX1 (T-cell leukemia homeobox 1) gene by chromosomal translocation is a recurrent event in human T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Ectopic expression of TLX1 in murine bone marrow progenitor cells using a conventional retroviral vector efficiently yields immortalized cell lines and induces T-ALL-like tumors in mice after long latency. METHODS: To eliminate a potential contribution of retroviral insertional mutagenesis to TLX1 immortalizing and transforming function, we incorporated the TLX1 gene into an insulated self-inactivating retroviral vector. RESULTS: Retrovirally transduced TLX1-expressing murine bone marrow progenitor cells had a growth/survival advantage and readily gave rise to immortalized cell lines. Extensive characterization of 15 newly established cell lines failed to reveal a common retroviral integration site. This comprehensive analysis greatly extends our previous study involving a limited number of cell lines, providing additional support for the view that constitutive TLX1 expression is sufficient to initiate the series of events culminating in hematopoietic progenitor cell immortalization. When TLX1-immortalized cells were co-cultured on OP9-DL1 monolayers under conditions permissive for T-cell differentiation, a latent T-lineage potential was revealed. However, the cells were unable to transit the DN2 myeloid-T (DN2mt)-DN2 T-lineage determined (DN2t) commitment step. The differentiation block coincided with failure to upregulate the zinc finger transcription factor gene Bcl11b, the human ortholog of which was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of TLX1 downregulated in the TLX1(+) T-ALL cell line ALL-SIL. Other studies have described the ability of TLX1 to promote bypass of mitotic checkpoint arrest, leading to aneuploidy. We likewise found that diploid TLX1-expressing DN2mt cells treated with the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel bypassed the mitotic checkpoint and displayed chromosomal instability. This was associated with elevated expression of TLX1 transcriptional targets involved in DNA replication and mitosis, including Ccna2 (cyclin A2), Ccnb1 (cyclin B1), Ccnb2 (cyclin B2) and Top2a (topoisomerase IIalpha). Notably, enforced expression of BCL11B in ALL-SIL T-ALL cells conferred resistance to the topoisomerase IIalpha poison etoposide. CONCLUSION: Taken together with previous findings, the data reinforce a mechanism of TLX1 oncogenic activity linked to chromosomal instability resulting from dysregulated expression of target genes involved in mitotic processes. We speculate that repression of BCL11B expression may provide part of the explanation for the observation that aneuploid DNA content in TLX1(+) leukemic T cells does not necessarily portend an unfavorable prognosis. This TLX1 hematopoietic progenitor cell immortalization/T-cell differentiation assay should help further our understanding of the mechanisms of TLX1-mediated evolution to malignancy and has the potential to be a useful predictor of disease response to novel therapeutic agents in TLX1(+) T-ALL.","['Zweier-Renn, Lynnsey A', 'Riz, Irene', 'Hawley, Teresa S', 'Hawley, Robert G']","['Zweier-Renn LA', 'Riz I', 'Hawley TS', 'Hawley RG']","['Department of Anatomy and Regenerative Biology, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Sino-US Joint Laboratory of Translational Medicine, Jining Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Bone Marrow Res,Journal of bone marrow research,101610405,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11B, Topoisomerase IIalpha', 'Bone marrow progenitor immortalization', 'DN2mt differentiation arrest', 'Mitotic spindle checkpoint', 'TLX1']",2013/02/20 00:00,2013/02/20 00:01,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/20 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4172/2329-8820.1000105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Marrow Res. 2013 Feb 20;1. doi: 10.4172/2329-8820.1000105.,,"['R01 HL066305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR031988/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4191823,['NIHMS470705'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An infectious etiology has been suggested and supported by epidemiological evidences; however, the identity of the involved agent(s) is not known. We considered that early transmitted lymphotropic herpes viruses were good candidates, since transforming mechanisms have been described for them and some are already associated with human cancers. In this study we interrogated the direct role of EBV, HCMV, HHV6, and HHV7 human herpes viruses in childhood ALL. Viral genomes were screened in 70 bone marrow samples from ALL patients through standard and a more sensitive nested PCR. Positive samples were detected only by nested PCR indicating a low level of infection. Our result argues that viral genomes were not present in all leukemic cells, and, hence, infection most likely was not part of the initial genetic lesions leading to ALL. The high statistical power of the study suggested that these agents are not involved in the genesis of ALL in Mexican children. Additional analysis showed that detected infections or coinfections were not associated with prognosis.","['Morales-Sanchez, A', 'Pompa-Mera, E N', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Alvarez-Rodriguez, F J', 'Bekker-Mendez, V C', 'Flores-Chapa, J de Diego', 'Flores-Lujano, J', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, E', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez, J G', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda, M C', 'Torres-Nava, J R', 'Velazquez-Avina, M M', 'Amador-Sanchez, R', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, M', 'Reyes-Zepeda, N', 'Espinosa-Elizondo, R M', 'Perez-Saldivar, M L', 'Nunez-Enriquez, J C', 'Mejia-Arangure, J M', 'Fuentes-Panana, E M']","['Morales-Sanchez A', 'Pompa-Mera EN', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Alvarez-Rodriguez FJ', 'Bekker-Mendez VC', 'Flores-Chapa Jde D', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez JG', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda MC', 'Torres-Nava JR', 'Velazquez-Avina MM', 'Amador-Sanchez R', 'Alvarado-Ibarra M', 'Reyes-Zepeda N', 'Espinosa-Elizondo RM', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Fuentes-Panana EM']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, CMN Siglo-XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Avenida Cuauhtemoc 330, Colonia Doctores, 06720 Mexico, DF, Mexico ;

We estimated incidence rate of mortality, 5-year survival rate, Kaplan-Meier survival function, and hazard ratio using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data during 1973-2009. There was significant variability in pediatric ALL survival by age at diagnosis. Survival peaked among children diagnosed at 1-4 years and steadily declined among those diagnosed at older ages. Infants (<1 year) had the lowest survivorship. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model stratified by year of diagnosis, those diagnosed in age groups 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years were 82%, 75%, 57%, and 32% less likely to die compared to children diagnosed in infancy, respectively. Age at diagnosis remained to be a crucial determinant of the survival variability of pediatric ALL patients, after adjusting for sex, race, radiation therapy, primary tumor sites, immunophenotype, and year of diagnosis.

Analysis of this hypothesis requires tailored statistical methods as single marker tests fail on rare variants. An entire class of statistical methods collapses rare variants from a genomic region of interest (ROI), thereby aggregating rare variants. In an extensive simulation study using data from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 we compared the performance of 15 collapsing methods by means of a variety of pre-defined ROIs regarding minor allele frequency thresholds and functionality. Findings of the simulation study were additionally confirmed by a real data set investigating the association between methotrexate clearance and the SLCO1B1 gene in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our analyses showed substantially inflated type I error levels for many of the proposed collapsing methods. Only four approaches yielded valid type I errors in all considered scenarios. None of the statistical tests was able to detect true associations over a substantial proportion of replicates in the simulated data. Detailed annotation of functionality of variants is crucial to detect true associations. These findings were confirmed in the analysis of the real data. Recent theoretical work showed that large power is achieved in gene-based analyses only if large sample sizes are available and a substantial proportion of causing rare variants is present in the gene-based analysis. Many of the investigated statistical approaches use permutation requiring high computational cost. There is a clear need for valid, powerful and fast to calculate test statistics for studies investigating rare variants.","['Dering, Carmen', 'Konig, Inke R', 'Ramsey, Laura B', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Ziegler, Andreas']","['Dering C', 'Konig IR', 'Ramsey LB', 'Relling MV', 'Yang W', 'Ziegler A']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biometrie und Statistik, Universitat zu Lubeck, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Biometrie und Statistik, Universitat zu Lubeck, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Lubeck, Germany.', ""Pharmaceutical Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Pharmaceutical Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Pharmaceutical Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Institut fur Medizinische Biometrie und Statistik, Universitat zu Lubeck, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Lubeck, Germany ; Zentrum fur Klinische Studien, Universitat zu Lubeck Lubeck, Germany ; School of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal Durban, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140915,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SLCO1B1', 'burden test', 'collapsing', 'comparison', 'rare variants', 'simulation study']",2014/10/14 06:00,2014/10/14 06:01,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2014.00323 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2014 Sep 15;5:323. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2014.00323. eCollection 2014.,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM031575/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4164031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the main cellular component of the bone marrow, adipocytes may contribute to the development of hematologic tumors. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes experimental data on adipocytes and their interaction with various cancer cells. Special focus is set on the interactions of bone marrow adipocytes and normal and transformed cells of the hematopoietic system such as myeloma and leukemia cells. Current in vitro and in vivo data are summarized and the potential of novel therapeutic targets is critically discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Targeting lipid metabolism of cancer cells and adipocytes in combination with standard therapeutics might open novel therapeutic avenues in these cancer entities. Adipocyte-derived products such as free fatty acids and specific adipokines such as adiponectin may be vital anti-cancer targets in hematologic malignancies. However, available data on lipid metabolism is currently mostly referring to peripheral fat cell/cancer cell interactions and results need to be evaluated specifically for the bone marrow niche.","['Johrer, Karin', 'Ploner, Christian', 'Thangavadivel, Shanmugapriya', 'Wuggenig, Philipp', 'Greil, Richard']","['Johrer K', 'Ploner C', 'Thangavadivel S', 'Wuggenig P', 'Greil R']","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute , Innrain 66, 6020 Innsbruck , Austria karin.joehrer@tkfi.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141011,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Adipokines/metabolism/*physiology', 'Adipose Tissue/physiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', '*Cell Communication', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lipids/*physiology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['adipocyte', 'adipokine', 'bone marrow', 'chemokine', 'leukemia', 'myeloma']",2014/10/14 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2015.970632 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015 Jan;15(1):61-77. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2015.970632.

Overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and/or Mcl-1 has been associated with chemoresistance in AML cell lines and with poor clinical outcome of AML patients. Thus, inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins could be novel therapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated how clinically achievable concentrations of obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, potentiate the antileukemic activity of cytarabine in AML cells. MTT assays in AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts, as well as flow cytometry analyses in AML cell lines revealed synergistic antileukemic activity between cytarabine and obatoclax. Bax activation was detected in the combined, but not the individual, drug treatments. This was accompanied by significantly increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Most importantly, in AML cells treated with the combination, enhanced early induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) preceded a decrease of Mcl-1 levels, nuclear translocation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, and apoptosis. These results indicate that obatoclax enhances cytarabine-induced apoptosis by enhancing DNA DSBs. This novel mechanism provides compelling evidence for the clinical use of BH3 mimetics in combination with DNA-damaging agents in AML and possibly a broader range of malignancies.","['Xie, Chengzhi', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Caldwell, J Timothy', 'Wang, Guan', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Xie C', 'Edwards H', 'Caldwell JT', 'Wang G', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, The Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'MD/PhD Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Cancer Biology Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, The Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, PR China; Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', ""Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA."", 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, The Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, PR China.

It mainly interacts with DNA, but can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cell components. Unfortunately, numerous side effects, such as severe cardiotoxicity and bone-marrow suppression, limit its use. To reduce this obstacle and improve its pharmacokinetics, we conjugated DOX to transferrin (TRF), a human plasma protein. In our study, we compared the effect of DOX and the doxorubicin-transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) on human leukemic lymphoblasts (CCRF-CEM), and on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In parallel, experiments were carried out on two human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines derived from K562 cells, of which one was sensitive and the other resistant to doxorubicin (K562/DOX). By use of the alkaline comet assay, the effect of the agents on the induction of DNA damage in normal human cells and human leukemia cells was determined. Oxidative and alkylating DNA damage were assayed by a slightly modified comet assay that included the use of the DNA-repair enzymes endonuclease III (Endo III) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). To investigate whether DNA breaks are the result of apoptosis, we examined the induction of DNA fragmentation visualized as oligosomal ladders after simple agarose electrophoresis under neutral conditions. Modifications of the genome induced by the different drugs were analyzed following assessment of the cell-cycle phase. The DOX-TRF conjugate caused more DNA damage than the free drug, the degree of DNA fragmentation being dependent on the duration of treatment and the cell type analyzed. With neutral agarose electrophoresis we showed that the test compounds caused the formation of a characteristic DNA-ladder pattern. Furthermore, the DOX-TRF conjugate generated a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the subG1 fraction and blocked more cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle than did free DOX. In summary, both agents induced DNA damage in cancer cells, but the DOX-TRF conjugate generated more genotoxic effects and apoptosis than the unconjugated drug.","['Szwed, Marzena', 'Jozwiak, Zofia']","['Szwed M', 'Jozwiak Z']","['Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.

The risk of second cancers was 2.38 times higher than the expected risk in the general population. Ninety-three patients (40%) had other cancers before and 66 patients (28%) after FCR. Rates of therapy related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AML/MDS) (5.1%) and Richter transformation (RT) (9%) were high, while solid tumors were not increased. Overall survival of patients with second cancers after frontline FCR was shorter (median of 4.5 years) compared to patients with and without prior cancers. Second cancer risk after frontline FCR is mainly due to high rates of t-AML/MDS and RT, and as speculated the survival of affected patients is shorter.","['Benjamini, Ohad', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Trinh, Long', 'Qiao, Wei', 'Strom, Sara S', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Burger, Jan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wierda, William', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael']","['Benjamini O', 'Jain P', 'Trinh L', 'Qiao W', 'Strom SS', 'Lerner S', 'Wang X', 'Burger J', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wierda W', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating M']",['Department of Leukemia.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141119,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoid leukemia', 'chemotherapeutic approaches', 'pharmacotherapeutics']",2014/10/14 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.957203 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Jun;56(6):1643-50. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.957203.

Immunophenotyping is essential and genetic testing may also be necessary. However, the relative value of each specimen or ancillary study in the diagnosis and classification has not been systematically established. We have performed a blinded retrospective review to assess what in our laboratory was the relative value of each specimen type and ancillary study in the diagnostic workup of B-CLPN. METHODS: A total of 185 cases of PB, BM, spleen and lymph nodes were analyzed for relative value of morphology, IHC, flow cytometry study in the diagnosis of B-CLPN. RESULTS: 'High yield' specimen was identified in most B-CLPN categories, which was highly predictive of the final WHO diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The goal of this retrospective study was to attempt to assess what was the relative value of morphology, immunophenotype, and molecular/cytogenetic study in various sites in the overall diagnostic process in our institution. We investigated the utility of the 'high yield' specimens in achieving the correct final diagnosis. In our study, some B-CLPNs notably splenic marginal zone lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia variant, required all studies for a 'best fit' type of diagnosis. In other cases, the morphology of a single specimen type was highly predictive of the final diagnosis, although confirmatory studies are recommended for definitive diagnosis.","['Zhang, Q-Y', 'Chabot-Richards, D', 'Evans, M', 'Spengel, K', 'Andrews, J', 'Kang, H', 'Foucar, K']","['Zhang QY', 'Chabot-Richards D', 'Evans M', 'Spengel K', 'Andrews J', 'Kang H', 'Foucar K']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic B cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms', 'bone marrow', 'cost-effective', 'flow cytometry', 'immunohistochemistry', 'peripheral blood']",2014/10/14 06:00,2016/01/19 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12299 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Jun;37(3):390-402. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12299.

In this study 50 clinically normal and 50 cats with cutaneous and/or systemic signs that lived in an endemic area and had been previously examined for infection by L. infantum using PCR in four different tissues were serologically tested for the presence of anti-Leishmania IgG (IFAT and ELISA) and IgM (IFAT). The aim was to compare the results of IFAT, ELISA and PCR and to investigate the possible associations between seropositivity to Leishmania spp and signalment, living conditions, season of sampling, health status of the cats, and seropositivity to other infectious agents. Low concentrations of anti-Leishmania IgG were detected by IFAT in 10% of the cats and by ELISA in 1%, whereas anti-Leishmania IgM were detected by IFAT in 1%. There was disagreement between the results of IFAT and ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG (P = 0.039) and between all serological tests and PCR (P < 0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests, using PCR as the gold standard, was very low, but ELISA and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM had 100% specificity. The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests could not be improved by changing the cut-off values. Seropositivity for Leishmania spp was not associated with signalment, living conditions, season of sampling and health status of the cats or with seropositivity to feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae. In conclusion, because of their low sensitivity and very high specificity two of the evaluated serological tests (ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM) may be useless as population screening tests but valuable for diagnosing feline infection by L. infantum.","['Chatzis, Manolis K', 'Leontides, Leonidas', 'Athanasiou, Labrini V', 'Papadopoulos, Elias', 'Kasabalis, Dimitrios', 'Mylonakis, Mathios', 'Rallis, Timoleon', 'Koutinas, Alexandros F', 'Andreadou, Margarita', 'Ikonomopoulos, John', 'Saridomichelakis, Manolis N']","['Chatzis MK', 'Leontides L', 'Athanasiou LV', 'Papadopoulos E', 'Kasabalis D', 'Mylonakis M', 'Rallis T', 'Koutinas AF', 'Andreadou M', 'Ikonomopoulos J', 'Saridomichelakis MN']","['Clinic of Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Thessaly, 224 Trikalon Str., GR-43100 Karditsa, Greece.

Type I hypersensitivity is an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated allergic disorder. Fructus piperis is derived from the ripe fruit of the pepper, which is widely used as a spice in human diets and is also administered as a medicine in many countries. Piperine has been shown to have anti-oxidant, anti-depressant, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effect of piperine on IgE-mediated allergic responses has not been reported. Here, the rat basophilic leukemia cells by membrane chromatography (RBL-2H3/CMC) coupled to high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) to discover and identify piperine can bind to RBL-2H3 cell membranes. Piperine inhibited the expression of cytokines, and the release of both beta-hexosaminidase and histamine, which could be stimulated by antigen in RBL-2H3 mast cells. We found that the levels of intracellular Ca(2+) also decreased. Furthermore, RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-alpha were significantly suppressed by piperine. The inhibitory effect of piperine on IgE-mediated degranulation and cytokine production by RBL-2H3 cells may be caused by the inhibition of IgE-mediated signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of Lyn, p38, Erk, and Ras. In summary, piperine can inhibit antigen-induced allergic reactions that control degranulation.","['Huang, Jing', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Han, Shengli', 'Cao, Jingjing', 'Chen, Qinhua', 'Wang, Sicen']","['Huang J', 'Zhang T', 'Han S', 'Cao J', 'Chen Q', 'Wang S']","[""School of Pharmacy, Heath Science Center Xi'an Jiaotong University, 76#, Yanta Westroad, Xi'an 710061, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Heath Science Center Xi'an Jiaotong University, 76#, Yanta Westroad, Xi'an 710061, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Heath Science Center Xi'an Jiaotong University, 76#, Yanta Westroad, Xi'an 710061, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Heath Science Center Xi'an Jiaotong University, 76#, Yanta Westroad, Xi'an 710061, China."", 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Screening, Hubei University of Medicine, Hubei, Shiyan, 442008, China.', ""School of Pharmacy, Heath Science Center Xi'an Jiaotong University, 76#, Yanta Westroad, Xi'an 710061, China.

But the regulatory mechanism that drives HOXA10 expression is still unclear. In the present paper, HOXA10 regulated by MLL1 (mixed lineage leukaemia histone methylase 1) with an epigenetic way has been demonstrated. The HOXA10 promoter contains several EREs (oestrogen response elements), including ERE1 and ERE2, which are close to the transcription start site, and are associated with E2-mediated activation of HOXA10. It has been shown that knockdown of the ERalpha (oestrogen receptor alpha) suppresses E2-mediated activation of HOXA10. Similarly, knockdown of MLL1 suppresses activation of HOXA10 and is bound to the ERE of HOXA10 promoter in an E2-dependent manner by forming complex with ERalpha. Knockdown of ERalpha affects the E2-dependent binding of MLL1 into HOXA10 EREs, suggesting critical roles of ERalpha in recruiting MLL on the HOXA10 promoter. More interestingly, the methylation status of histone protein H3K4 (H3 at lysine 4) with E2 is much higher than without E2 treatment in leukaemia cell. On the contrary, the methylation status of HOXA10 promoter with E2 treatment is much lower, which elevate the HOXA10 expression. Moreover, with ERalpha knockdown, the H3K4 methylation level is also decrease in myeloid cell. Overall, it has been clearly demonstrated that HOXA10 is transcriptionally regulated by MLL1, which, in coordination with ERalpha, plays a critical role in this process with epigenetic way and suggests a potential anti-E2 treatment of AML.","['Yao, Jie', 'Fang, Li-Chao', 'Yang, Zai-Lin', 'Huang, Hui', 'Li, Yan', 'Deng, Jun', 'Zheng, Junsong']","['Yao J', 'Fang LC', 'Yang ZL', 'Huang H', 'Li Y', 'Deng J', 'Zheng J']","[""*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""daggerDepartment of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""*Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['BSR20140116 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20140116 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2014 Dec 8;34(6):e00156. doi: 10.1042/BSR20140116.,,,PMC4266925,,,,,,['Biosci Rep. 2021 Apr 30;41(4):.

In patients relapsing early after SCT treatment, options are further limited by the fear for increased toxicity. We report our experience with ARA-C and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) combination in relapsed post-SCT AML patients. Therapy consisted of ARA-C (1 gr/m(2)) for 4 days followed by one dose of GO 9 mg/m(2) on day 5 and was supported by donor stem cells when possible. Responding patients not developing graft versus host disease (GVHD) were eligible for immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or a second Allo-SCT. Sixteen patients, median age 53 years (range 31-63), are included in this analysis. Patients underwent SCT for high-risk AML (n = 11) or AML relapse (n = 5), and 81 % had an early post-SCT relapse. Responses were achieved in 60 % of evaluable patients (CR-5 CRp-4). Median probabilities of survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in the entire cohort, responding and non-responding patients were 103 and 76 days, 183 and 97 days, and 79 and 16 days, respectively. At 1-year follow-up, 25 % of patients were alive; however, all had relapse. Treatment resulted in grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in all patients, and 27 % each had grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia or elevation of liver enzymes. One patient died during treatment due to intracranial hemorrhage. Of the six patients proceeding to second SCT or receiving DLI, three patients developed mild veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Combination therapy with ARA-C and GO after SCT results in short-term disease control and limited toxicity and could be considered for patients who are candidates for further immunotherapy.","['Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Maayan, Hannah', 'Apel, Arie', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Koren-Michowitz M', 'Maayan H', 'Apel A', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Volchek Y', 'Avigdor A', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, maya.koren@sheba.health.gov.il.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141014,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2229-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Mar;94(3):375-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2229-3.

A prolongation of the therapeutic anticoagulation beyond the usual 3 to 6 months can only be recommended in high-risk settings and after careful evaluation of potential risks and benefits for the individual patient. New direct oral anticoagulants (NOAC) should not preferentially be used due to lack of clinical experience in patients with MPN and potential drug interactions (e.g. with JAK inhibitors).

The most common recipient-derived lymphomas were monomorphic B-cell PTLDs (n = 45), monomorphic T cell PTLDs (n = 9), indolent lymphomas (n = 6), and polymorphic PTLD (n = 4). Half of the recipient-derived PTLDs were Epstein-Barr virus-positive. Twelve of the recipient-derived PTLDs were located in the grafts: in four cases exclusively and in eight cases in combination with disseminated disease outside the graft.

Among the key molecules of nuclear inositide pathways, phosphoinositide-phospholipase (PI-PLC) C &#946;1 is essential for regulating hematopoiesis, particularly along myeloid and erythroid lineage. Moreover, Akt activation is associated with protein synthesis, via mTOR pathway, and with erythroid induction, through PI-PLCgamma1 activation. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a series of heterogeneous diseases characterized by ineffective hemopoiesis, with a variable risk of evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therapeutic approaches for MDS include demethylating agents, such as azacitidine, aiming at reducing cell proliferation, and erythropoietin, useful for sustaining a normal erythropoiesis. In the last few years, a role for nuclear inositide signalling as a therapeutic target in MDS has been disclosed, in that PI-PLC&#946;1 increase is associated with azacitidine responsiveness, even when this drug is used in combination with other agents, and Akt is specifically activated in MDS at higher risk of AML evolution. On the other hand, recent data demonstrated that inositide signalling can also be involved in erythroid therapy, given the inhibitory effect of erythropoietin on PI-PLC&#946;1 and the activation of Akt/PI-PLCgamma1 pathway, following the administration of erythropoietin. Here, we review the strategic role of nuclear inositide signalling in MDS, in pathogenesis and therapy.","['Manzoli, Lucia', 'Mongiorgi, Sara', 'Clissa, Cristina', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Poli, Alessandro', 'Quaranta, Marilisa', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Follo, Matilde Y']","['Manzoli L', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Clissa C', 'Finelli C', 'Billi AM', 'Poli A', 'Quaranta M', 'Cocco L', 'Follo MY']","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Institute of Human Anatomy, DIBINEM, University of Bologna, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.. matilde.follo@unibo.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141013,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,,,,,,2014/10/14 06:00,2014/10/14 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['MRMC-EPUB-62779 [pii]'],aheadofprint,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2014 Oct 13. pii: MRMC-EPUB-62779.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although comparative studies of adult patients undergoing HSCT have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and safety of twice-daily infusion (TD) compared with continuous infusion (CIF) of CsA, to our knowledge, similar studies have not yet been performed in pediatric groups. PROCEDURE: A self-administered questionnaire was used to retrospectively compare the clinical outcome and incidence of CsA-associated adverse events of 70 pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia patients who were receiving CsA by TD (n = 36) or CIF (n = 34) as GVHD prophylaxis for their first allogeneic HSCT. RESULTS: The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD, as well as the overall survival and event-free survival rates, did not differ significantly between the TD and CIF groups; however, the incidence of severe hypertension was significantly higher in the CIF group than the TD group. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis presented here indicates that TD and CIF administration of CsA have similar prophylactic effect on pediatric GVHD and suggest that TD is associated with a lower rate of toxicity than CIF in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT.

Hearing loss and blindness rarely occurs in patients with leukemia; however, it can be strong association with hyper-viscosity syndrome. The purpose of this paper is to report a case of acute hearing loss as the initial manifestation of acute leukemia and hyper-viscosity syndrome and also mainly aspects of the intensive care treatment. CASE REPORT: A 41 year-old, male patient, who has been complaining about dizziness for six months with no response to symptomatic medications, was admitted to the emergency department with acute hearing loss. The physical examination was normal except for a bilateral hearing loss without an apparent cause. Laboratory exams showed total leukocyte: 645.000 with 66.4% blasts, hemoglobin: 7.0, hematocrit: 20.5, urea: 94, creatinine: 1.59, K: 5.6, Na: 138, INR: 1.38, TTPa: 0.89, troponin lower than 0.2, CK: 218, CKMB: 50, uric acid: 11.1. After a first hypothesis of leukemia with a high risk of hyper-viscosity complications, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and treatment. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and than started hidratation, hydroxyurea, allopurinol, dexamethasone. According to hematologists the patient had a chronic myeloid leukemia. Leukopheresis was performed one week after admission when total blood leukocytes were around 488.000. Ten days after the procedure the patient had no improvement of the hearing loss but total leukocytes were 10.100. He was discharge to the ward and 2 weeks later went home to continue ambulatory treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of sensitive manifestations in patients with leukemia include not only visual and hearing loss but also many others manifestations such as conductive vertigo, facial palsy and infections. Hyperviscosity syndrome due to hyperleukocytosis is also a possible cause of sensorial loss, but the syndrome is often dependent on leukocyte counts greater than (>100 x 10(9)/L).This case is a representative of rare cases in which acute sensorineural hearing loss occurred as the initial manifestation of hyper-viscosity syndrome due to leukemia.","['Amancio, Juliana', 'Scuro, Gisele', 'Gazoni, Fernanda Martins', 'Guimaraes, Helio Penna', 'Vendrame, Leticia Sandre', 'Lopes, Renato Delascio', 'Lopes, Antonio Carlos']","['Amancio J', 'Scuro G', 'Gazoni FM', 'Guimaraes HP', 'Vendrame LS', 'Lopes RD', 'Lopes AC']","['EPM, UNIFESP.', 'EPM, UNIFESP.', 'EPM, UNIFESP.', 'EPM, UNIFESP.', 'AMB, AMIB.', 'EPM, UNIFESP.', 'EPM, UNIFESP.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,9506692,,,,,,2008/03/01 00:00,2008/03/01 00:01,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['S0103-507X2008000100016 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Ter Intensiva. 2008 Mar;20(1):99-102.,,,,,,,,,,,,Leucemia mieloide cronica e sindrome de hiper-viscosidade: relato de caso.,,,,,,

Recently, it has been found that deletion of Asxl1 or expression of C-terminal-truncating ASXL1-MTs inhibit myeloid differentiation and induce MDS-like disease in mice. Here, we find that SET-binding protein 1 (SETBP1) mutations (SETBP1-MT) are enriched among ASXL1-mutated MDS patients and associated with increased incidence of leukemic transformation, as well as shorter survival, suggesting that SETBP1-MT play a critical role in leukemic transformation of MDS. We identify that SETBP1-MT inhibit ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of SETBP1, resulting in increased expression. Expression of SETBP1-MT, in turn, inhibited protein phosphatase 2A activity, leading to Akt activation and enhanced expression of posterior Hoxa genes in ASXL1-mutant cells. Biologically, SETBP1-MT augmented ASXL1-MT-induced differentiation block, inhibited apoptosis and enhanced myeloid colony output. SETBP1-MT collaborated with ASXL1-MT in inducing acute myeloid leukemia in vivo. The combination of ASXL1-MT and SETBP1-MT activated a stem cell signature and repressed the tumor growth factor-beta signaling pathway, in contrast to the ASXL1-MT-induced MDS model. These data reveal that SETBP1-MT are critical drivers of ASXL1-mutated MDS and identify several deregulated pathways as potential therapeutic targets in high-risk MDS.","['Inoue, D', 'Kitaura, J', 'Matsui, H', 'Hou, H-A', 'Chou, W-C', 'Nagamachi, A', 'Kawabata, K C', 'Togami, K', 'Nagase, R', 'Horikawa, S', 'Saika, M', 'Micol, J-B', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Harada, Y', 'Harada, H', 'Inaba, T', 'Tien, H-F', 'Abdel-Wahab, O', 'Kitamura, T']","['Inoue D', 'Kitaura J', 'Matsui H', 'Hou HA', 'Chou WC', 'Nagamachi A', 'Kawabata KC', 'Togami K', 'Nagase R', 'Horikawa S', 'Saika M', 'Micol JB', 'Hayashi Y', 'Harada Y', 'Harada H', 'Inaba T', 'Tien HF', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141013,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014301 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.301 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):847-57. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.301.

In murine models, high ERG expression induces both T-ALL and AML. However, no study to date has defined the effect of high ERG expression on primary human hematopoietic cells. In the present study, human CD34+ cells were transduced with retroviral vectors to elevate ERG gene expression to levels detected in high ERG AML. RNA sequencing was performed on purified populations of transduced cells to define the effects of high ERG on gene expression in human CD34+ cells. Integration of the genome-wide expression data with other data sets revealed that high ERG drives an expression signature that shares features of normal hematopoietic stem cells, high ERG AMLs, early T-cell precursor-ALLs and leukemic stem cell signatures associated with poor clinical outcome. Functional assays linked this gene expression profile to enhanced progenitor cell expansion. These results support a model whereby a stem cell gene expression network driven by high ERG in human cells enhances the expansion of the progenitor pool, providing opportunity for the acquisition and propagation of mutations and the development of leukemia.","['Tursky, M L', 'Beck, D', 'Thoms, J A I', 'Huang, Y', 'Kumari, A', 'Unnikrishnan, A', 'Knezevic, K', 'Evans, K', 'Richards, L A', 'Lee, E', 'Morris, J', 'Goldberg, L', 'Izraeli, S', 'Wong, J W H', 'Olivier, J', 'Lock, R B', 'MacKenzie, K L', 'Pimanda, J E']","['Tursky ML', 'Beck D', 'Thoms JA', 'Huang Y', 'Kumari A', 'Unnikrishnan A', 'Knezevic K', 'Evans K', 'Richards LA', 'Lee E', 'Morris J', 'Goldberg L', 'Izraeli S', 'Wong JW', 'Olivier J', 'Lock RB', 'MacKenzie KL', 'Pimanda JE']","[""1] Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia [2] Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal North Shore Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', '1] Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel [2] Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel [2] Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Mathematics and Statistics, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", '1] Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia [2] Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', '*Transcriptome', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014299 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.299 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):819-27. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.299.

Consequently, immunosuppressive agents are rational choices for treatment. This first prospective trial in LGL leukemia was a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating methotrexate (MTX) at 10 mg/m(2) orally weekly as initial therapy (step 1). Patients failing MTX were eligible for treatment with cyclophosphamide at 100 mg orally daily (step 2). The overall response in step 1 was 38% with 95% confidence interval (CI): 26 and 53%. The overall response in step 2 was 64% with 95% CI: 35 and 87%. The median overall survival for patients with anemia was 69 months with a 95% CI lower bound of 46 months and an upper bound not yet reached. The median overall survival for patients with neutropenia has not been reached 13 years from study activation. Serum biomarker studies confirmed the inflammatory milieu of LGL but were not a priori predictive of response. We identify a gene expression signature that correlates with response and may be STAT3 mutation driven. Immunosuppressive therapies have efficacy in LGL leukemia. Gene signature and mutational profiling may be an effective tool in determining whether MTX is an appropriate therapy.","['Loughran, T P Jr', 'Zickl, L', 'Olson, T L', 'Wang, V', 'Zhang, D', 'Rajala, H L M', 'Hasanali, Z', 'Bennett, J M', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Litzow, M R', 'Evens, A M', 'Mustjoki, S', 'Tallman, M S']","['Loughran TP Jr', 'Zickl L', 'Olson TL', 'Wang V', 'Zhang D', 'Rajala HL', 'Hasanali Z', 'Bennett JM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Litzow MR', 'Evens AM', 'Mustjoki S', 'Tallman MS']","['University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester Cancer Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Ireland Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Tufts Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140913,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/complications/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Finland', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptome', 'United States']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014298 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.298 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):886-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.298.

DESIGN: Case series with internal comparison. SETTING: Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Febrile patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department with underlying haematological malignancy and receiving chemotherapy within 1 month of Accident and Emergency Department visit between June 2011 and July 2012. Similar cases between June 2010 and May 2011 served as historical referents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The compliance rate among emergency physicians, the door-to-antibiotic time before and after implementation of the protocol, and the impact of the protocol on Accident and Emergency Department and hospital service. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 50 were managed with the treatment protocol while 19 patients were historical referents. Acute myeloid leukaemia was the most commonly encountered malignancy. Overall, 88% of the patients presented with sepsis syndrome. The mean door-to-antibiotic time of those managed with the treatment protocol was 47 minutes versus 300 minutes in the referent group. Overall, 86% of patients in the treatment group met the target door-to-antibiotic time of less than 1 hour. The mean lengths of stay in the emergency department (76 minutes vs 105 minutes) and hospital (11 days vs 15 days) were shorter in those managed with the treatment protocol versus the historical referents. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the protocol can effectively shorten the door-to-antibiotic time to meet the international standard of care in neutropenic sepsis patients. The compliance rate was also high. We proved that effective implementation of the protocol is feasible in a busy emergency department through excellent teamwork between nurses, pharmacists, and emergency physicians.","['Ko, H F', 'Tsui, S S', 'Tse, Johnson W K', 'Kwong, W Y', 'Chan, O Y', 'Wong, Gordon C K']","['Ko HF', 'Tsui SS', 'Tse JW', 'Kwong WY', 'Chan OY', 'Wong GC']","['Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Jordan, Hong Kong.', 'Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Jordan, Hong Kong.', 'Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Jordan, Hong Kong.', 'Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Jordan, Hong Kong.', 'Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Jordan, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20141010,China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*complications', '*Clinical Protocols', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*standards', 'Female', 'Guideline Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Time-to-Treatment/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Drug therapy', 'Emergency service, hospital', 'Hematologic neoplasms', 'Sepsis']",2014/10/14 06:00,2015/10/29 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12809/hkmj144280 [doi]'],ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 2015 Feb;21(1):10-5. doi: 10.12809/hkmj144280.

Yet, there would also be hope. Most children with a diagnosis of leukaemia start their treatment as part of ongoing trials. The clinical teams looking after such children are motivated, knowledgeable and work in centres that specialise in the treatment of this lethal illness. The results speak for themselves. Not only have the trials helped oncologists learn more about which treatments work best. For years we have known that those who enter trials do better than those patients with similar characteristics who don't. We have recently also learnt that trials improve survival rates in those cancers population wide: the annual reduction between 1978-2005 in risk of death from childhood cancers ranged from 2.7% to 12.0%. This cancer trial culture is a splendid example of British health care delivery. What is happening in child psychiatry, though? If your child had, say, depression you would have every reason to be distraught too. The mortality rate is higher than in the general population and the burden of disease in the long run heavier than that of cardiovascular illness or cancer. Yet, your child would not have access to a trial. Instead, you would probably struggle to have your child's depression recognised in the first place. The care you would get would be determined by extreme regional variations and by what resources are available to local services and often the ideology or preferences of practitioners.","['Stringaris, Argyris']",['Stringaris A'],,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Introductory Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",0375361,,IM,"['Child', 'Child Psychiatry/*standards', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Psychology, Child/*standards']",['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical trials', 'child and adolescent psychiatry']",2014/10/14 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcpp.12343 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2014 Nov;55(11):1185-6. doi: 10.1111/jcpp.12343.,['(c) 2014 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.'],"['Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Immunohistochemical examination revealed lower Bax and PML expressions and higher Bcl-2 expression in the majority of untreated patients, suggesting the suppressed mechanisms triggering tumor cell apoptosis. Cytotoxic therapy resulted in a statistically significant rise in the expression of the apoptosis activator Bax (p = 0.01), a reduction in the level of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 (p = 0.04) and a slight increase in PML that controlled the induction of apoptosis. Adding an anti-VEGF agent to cytotoxic therapy exerted no statistically significant impact on Bax and Bcl-2, but caused more frequent positive PML expression than in the control and cytotoxic chemotherapy groups.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In the women with CE, the level of surface epitheliocytes with pinopodia was significantly lower than that in the comparison group (mean 37.5 +/- 2.1; p < 0.01). There was an increase in ER expression in the integumentary and glandular epithelium (mean 102.5 +/- 6.8 scores; p < 0.01) and stromal cells (110.2 +/- 8.3 scores; p > 0.05). In the control group, the intensity of PR expression was, on the contrary, significantly lower in both the integumentary epithelium and glandulocytes (mean 104.7 +/- 5.5 scores; p < 0.01) and stromal cells (178.5 +/- 11.3 scores; p < 0.01). In the study group, the PR/ER ratio was less than 2 in all cases: the mean PR/ER ratio was 1.1 +/- 0.09 for surface epitheliocytes and glandulocytes and 1.6 +/- 0.1 for stromal cells. In CE, the intensity of LIF expression was dramatically reduced and equal to 0.95 +/- 1.3 scores (p < 0.01). The found regularities suggest that CE is accompanied by an almost 4-fold decrease in LIF expression, which is evidence for significantly suppressed endometrial receptivity and may be regarded as a prognostic marker of failed implantation. CONCLUSION: The patients with CE were found to have an endometrial receptivity disorder involving the damaged surface epithelium of the uterine mucosa, pinopodia immaturity by the implantation window, decreased LIF expression, and ER hyperexpression. This may give rise to reproductive dysfunction in women with CE.","['Kazachkov, E L', 'Kazachkova, E A', 'Voropaeva, E E', 'Miroshnichenko, L E', 'Khelashvili, I G']","['Kazachkov EL', 'Kazachkova EA', 'Voropaeva EE', 'Miroshnichenko LE', 'Khelashvili IG']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Arkh Patol,Arkhiv patologii,0370604,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Endometritis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endometrium/metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelium', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*biosynthesis']",,,2014/10/14 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Arkh Patol. 2014 May-Jun;76(3):53-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemical structures of the compounds were determined from mass spectra and 1D- and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The anticancer effects of the isolated compounds were examined in HL-60 human acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells. Hericerin A (1) and hericerin (3) significantly reduced cell proliferation with IC50 values of 3.06 and 5.47 muM, respectively. These same compounds also induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, accompanied by time-dependent down-regulation of p-AKT and c-myc levels.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the BCR-ABL kinase are the treatment of choice for CML patients. Imatinib was the first TKI used in clinical practice with excellent results. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding regulatory RNAs that control gene expression and play an important role in cancer development and progression. Aberrant miRNA expression profiles have been shown to be characteristic of many cancers. Here, we demonstrate that miR-30e is expressed at low levels in CML cell lines and patient samples. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a putative target site for miR-30e in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the ABL gene. In agreement, luciferase assay verified that miR-30e directly targets ABL. Enforced expression of miR-30e in K562 cells suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of these cells and sensitized them to imatinib treatment. These findings strongly suggest that miR-30e acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating BCR-ABL expression. Up-regulation of miR-30e in CML cells may therefore have a therapeutic efficacy against this disease.","['Hershkovitz-Rokah, Oshrat', 'Modai, Shira', 'Pasmanik-Chor, Metsada', 'Toren, Amos', 'Shomron, Noam', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Granot, Galit']","['Hershkovitz-Rokah O', 'Modai S', 'Pasmanik-Chor M', 'Toren A', 'Shomron N', 'Raanani P', 'Shpilberg O', 'Granot G']","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Safra Children's Hospital, Tel-Hashomer, Israel."", 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel; Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Assuta Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.

METHODS: Patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at Children's Hospital of Michigan were eligible to participate in this study. Determination of the CYP3A variant for each patient was done using Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Patients were monitored during their leukemia treatment course for vincristine-related neurotoxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were enrolled. Twenty-nine Caucasian patients (81%) and 13 African-American patients (77%) experienced neurotoxicity. CYP3A genotyping was done for 52 patients. Two African-American and two Caucasian patients were homozygous A/A for the CYP3A5*3 polymorphism. Three of these patients (75%) experienced grade 2 neuropathy. Two Caucasian patients and one African-American patient were heterozygous A/G. Two of these patients (66.7%) experienced grade 2 or 3 neuropathy. Thirty-five patients (67.3%) were homozygous for the mutant inactive G/G allele for CYP3A5*3, eight African-American and 27 Caucasian patients. Of these, six of the African-American patients (75%) and 22 of the Caucasian patients (81.5%) experienced neuropathy. CONCLUSION: The CYP3A5*3 genotype causes very low expression of the CYP3A5 protein and hence decreased vincristine metabolism. In this study, patients who expressed CYP3A5*3 had an increased incidence of vincristine-related neurotoxicity. Overall, a greater percentage of Caucasian patients had documented incidences of neurotoxicity. A larger sample size and more detailed gene analysis are needed for future studies.","['Sims, Rosalyn P']",['Sims RP'],"[""Department of Pharmacy Services, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, USA rosp86@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141010,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Racial Groups/*genetics', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Vincristine metabolism', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'racial group']",2014/10/12 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2014/10/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155214553143 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155214553143 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2016 Feb;22(1):76-81. doi: 10.1177/1078155214553143.

This unusual case demonstrates that leukemic presentations of rhabdomyosarcoma can occur in older adults in the absence of an identifiable primary tumor.","['Kern, Jason B', 'Hii, Anselm', 'Kruse, Matthew J', 'Szabo, Zsolt', 'Argani, Pedram', 'Hibbard, Michele K', 'Gladstone, Douglas E', 'Meyer, Christian', 'Zheng, Rui', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Duffield, Amy S']","['Kern JB', 'Hii A', 'Kruse MJ', 'Szabo Z', 'Argani P', 'Hibbard MK', 'Gladstone DE', 'Meyer C', 'Zheng R', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Duffield AS']","['The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Clarient Inc, 31 Columbia, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Clarient Inc, 31 Columbia, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA aduffie1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20141010,United States,Int J Surg Pathol,International journal of surgical pathology,9314927,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/*pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma', 'bone marrow', 'cytogenetics', 'flow cytometry', 'immunohistochemistry']",2014/10/12 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/10/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1066896914553666 [pii]', '10.1177/1066896914553666 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Surg Pathol. 2015 Feb;23(1):75-7. doi: 10.1177/1066896914553666.

Here, we describe 2 JAK2(V617F)-JAK2(exon12)-negative PV patients who presented with a CALR mutation in peripheral granulocytes at the time of diagnosis. In both cases, the CALR mutation was a 52-bp deletion. Single burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) from 1 patient were grown in vitro and genotyped: the same CALR del 52-bp mutation was noted in 31 of the 37 colonies examined; 30 of 31 BFU-E were heterozygous for CALR del 52 bp, and 1 of 31 BFU-E was homozygous for CALR del 52 bp.

LEDGF associates with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins and menin and is required for leukemic transformation. To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the LEDGF integrase-binding domain (IBD) interaction with MLL fusion proteins in leukemia, we determined the solution structure of the MLL-IBD complex. We found a novel MLL motif, integrase domain binding motif 2 (IBM2), which binds to a well-defined site on IBD. Point mutations within IBM2 abolished leukemogenic transformation by MLL-AF9, validating that this newly identified motif is essential for the oncogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins. Interestingly, the IBM2 binding site on IBD overlaps with the binding site for the HIV integrase (IN), and IN was capable of efficiently sequestering IBD from the menin-MLL complex. A short IBM2 peptide binds to IBD directly and inhibits both the IBD-MLL/menin and IBD-IN interactions. Our findings show that the same site on IBD is involved in binding to MLL and HIV-IN, revealing an attractive approach to simultaneously target LEDGF in leukemia and HIV.","['Murai, Marcelo J', 'Pollock, Jonathan', 'He, Shihan', 'Miao, Hongzhi', 'Purohit, Trupta', 'Yokom, Adam', 'Hess, Jay L', 'Muntean, Andrew G', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz']","['Murai MJ', 'Pollock J', 'He S', 'Miao H', 'Purohit T', 'Yokom A', 'Hess JL', 'Muntean AG', 'Grembecka J', 'Cierpicki T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141010,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'HIV Integrase/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/12 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39581-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-01-550079 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 11;124(25):3730-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-01-550079.

A 53-year-old woman with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome underwent related donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in July 2006. Three months after transplantation, a comparative short tandem repeat analysis between donor and recipient revealed full chimerism, indicating complete, healthy bone marrow reconstitution. Three years and ten months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the patient developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Another short tandem repeat analysis was carried out which showed mixed chimerism (52.62%), indicating relapsed disease. A donor lymphocyte infusion was administered. The purpose of donor lymphocyte infusion is to induce a graft-versus-leukemia effect; in fact, this donor's lymphocyte infusion induced full chimerism. Successive short tandem repeat analyses were performed as part of post-transplantation follow-up, and in July 2010, one such analysis again showed mixed chimerism (64.25%). Based on this finding, a second donor lymphocyte infusion was administered, but failed to eradicate the disease. In September 2011, the patient presented with relapsed disease, and a second related donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed. Subsequent short tandem repeat analyses revealed full chimerism, indicating complete bone marrow reconstitution. We conclude that quantitative detection of mixed chimerism is an important diagnostic tool that can guide early therapeutic intervention.","['Merzoni, Joice', 'Ewald, Gisele Menezes', 'Paz, Alessandra Aparecida', 'Daudt, Liane Esteves', 'Jobim, Luiz Fernando Job']","['Merzoni J', 'Ewald GM', 'Paz AA', 'Daudt LE', 'Jobim LF']","['Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

METHODS: The seroprevalence of L. chagasi antibodies prior to any treatment was investigated in children with clinical features of acute leukemia. Serological tests were performed in 470 samples drawn from under 14-year-old children from different regions of Brazil with clinical suspicion of acute leukemia. Acute leukemia subtypes were characterized by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry. Morphological analyses of bone marrow aspirates were systematically performed to visualize blast cells and/or the formation of L. chagasi amastigotes. Data analysis used a standard univariate procedure and the Pearson's chi-square test. RESULTS: The plasma of 437 children (93%) displayed antibodies against L. chagasi by indirect immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Of the 437 patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2006, 254 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 92 had acute myeloid leukemia, and 91 did not have acute leukemia. The seroprevalence of L. chagasi antibodies according to the indirect immunofluorescence assay test (22.5%) was similar in children with or without acute leukemia (p-value=0.76). The co-existence of visceral leishmanasis and acute leukemia was confirmed in 24 children. The overall survival of these children was poor with a high death rate during the first year of leukemia treatment. CONCLUSION: In the differential diagnosis of childhood leukemia, visceral leishmanasis should be considered as a potential concurrent disease in regions where L. chagasi is endemic.","['de Vasconcelos, Gisele Moledo', 'Azevedo-Silva, Fernanda', 'Dos Santos Thuler, Luiz Claudio', 'Pina, Eugenia Terra Granado', 'Souza, Celeste S F', 'Calabrese, Katia', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['de Vasconcelos GM', 'Azevedo-Silva F', 'Dos Santos Thuler LC', 'Pina ET', 'Souza CS', 'Calabrese K', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

Initial studies demonstrated that somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase KIT led to the establishment of a clonal mast cell population. Recent studies, in particular those involving next generation sequencing analyses of advanced systemic mastocytosis, have revealed mutations in additional genes. The respective genes encode proteins for various signaling pathways, epigenetic regulators, the RNA splicing machinery, and transcription factors. Although almost all of the detected mutations are somatic in nature, transgenerational transmission of MCAD appears to be quite common. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic predestination, e.g. germline mutations and the contribution of epigenetic processes, still await identification. The aim of the present review is to present and discuss available genetic findings, and to outline the relationship between adult-onset systemic MCAD and childhood-onset mastocytosis, often termed cutaneous mastocytosis, on the basis of current genetic data. Finally, the implications of increased knowledge of the molecular basis of MCAD in terms of diagnostics and therapy are discussed.","['Molderings, Gerhard J']",['Molderings GJ'],"['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital of Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.

Recently, mutations of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) have been identified in 40% to 50% of CMMLs and occasionally in other myeloid disorders. In this study, we established a robust assay for the detection of SRSF2 mutations in decalcified, paraffin-embedded bone marrow (BM) biopsies and investigated its diagnostic utility. BM biopsies of 78 patients with myeloid neoplasms, including 36 CMMLs, 22 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 20 Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) were analyzed. The region around hot spot P95 in exon 1 of SRSF2 was amplified and bidirectionally sequenced. In addition, a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was established. The JAK2 V617F mutation was investigated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. SRSF2 mutations were identified in 16 (44%) of 36 CMMLs, including 1 of 3 cases with associated systemic mastocytosis, 4 (20%) of 20 Ph- MPN, and 1 (4.5%) of 22 MDS. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis detected all mutations with the exception of a single P95A. Of note, 2 cases of JAK2 V617F+ primary myelofibrosis with SRSF2 mutation initially were diagnosed as CMML based on significant peripheral blood monocytosis. In CMML, no correlation with histopathology and/or clinical parameters was observed, but SRSF2 mutations were associated with normal karyotype (P < .001). In summary, SRSF2 mutations are frequent in CMML and a useful diagnostic feature demonstrable in BM biopsies, allowing a definitive diagnosis for cases with minimal dysplasia and normal karyotype. The role of SRSF2 mutations in cases with hybrid features between primary myelofibrosis and CMML needs further investigation.","['Federmann, Birgit', 'Abele, Manuel', 'Rosero Cuesta, David Santiago', 'Vogel, Wichard', 'Boiocchi, Leonardo', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Bonzheim, Irina', 'Fend, Falko']","['Federmann B', 'Abele M', 'Rosero Cuesta DS', 'Vogel W', 'Boiocchi L', 'Kanz L', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Orazi A', 'Bonzheim I', 'Fend F']","['Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany; Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, 50001 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Pathology Section, University of Brescia, 25100 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, 50001 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College/New York Presbyterian Hospital, 10065 NY, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen and University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.

The FM140 and FB3 combinations were administered to 21 and 27 patients, respectively. Efforts for early reduction (from day +30 to 60) and discontinuation (until day +100 to 130) of prophylactic immunosuppression were a component of the post-transplant approach. Following FB3 patients suffered from more severe stomatitis (P = 0.013). In contrast, other manifestations of regimen-related toxicity were more frequent in the FM140 group (P = 0.048). There were no statistically significant differences in the development of graft-versus-host disease, non-relapse mortality, post-transplant remission rate, or relapse incidence. Two-year disease-free survival rates were comparable in the two cohorts (66 vs. 55 %; P = 0.751), and so were the overall survival rates (64 vs. 62 %; P = 0.715). The outcomes of allografted patients with myeloid neoplasms were comparable after the FM140 and FB3 regimens. Relatively high therapeutic response in both groups may have been influenced by early reduction and discontinuation of prophylactic immunosuppression followed by effective immunological control of the malignant clone.","['Raida, Ludek', 'Rusinakova, Zuzana', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Szotkowska, Romana', 'Rohon, Peter', 'Skoumalova, Ivana', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Pikalova, Zuzana', 'Indrak, Karel', 'Langova, Katerina']","['Raida L', 'Rusinakova Z', 'Faber E', 'Szotkowska R', 'Rohon P', 'Skoumalova I', 'Divoka M', 'Pikalova Z', 'Indrak K', 'Langova K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, I.

However, previous studies in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia reported contradictory results. We prospectively collected data on body composition from a cohort of newly diagnosed Dutch pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=762, age 2-17 years). Patients were treated from 1997-2004 and the median follow-up was 9 years (range, 0-10). Body mass index at diagnosis was expressed as age- and gender-matched standard deviation scores and on the basis of these scores the patients were categorized as being underweight, of normal weight or overweight. Multivariate analyses showed that patients who were underweight (8%) had a higher risk of relapse [hazard ratio: 1.88, 95% confidence interval (1.13-3.13)], but similar overall survival and event-free survival as patients who had a normal weight or who were overweight. Patients with loss of body mass index during the first 32 weeks of treatment had a similar risk of relapse and event-free survival, but decreased overall survival [hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval (1.14-3.87)] compared to patients without a loss of body mass index. In addition, dual X-ray absorptiometry scans were performed in a nested, single-center cohort. Data from these scans revealed that a loss of body mass consisted mainly of a loss of lean body mass, while there was a gain in the percentage of fat. In conclusion, being underweight at diagnosis is a risk factor for relapse, and a decrease in body mass index early during treatment is associated with decreased survival. In addition, loss of body mass during treatment seems to consist mainly of a loss of lean body mass. This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee in 1996 (trial number NTR460/SNWLK-ALL-9).","['den Hoed, Marissa A H', 'Pluijm, Saskia M F', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester A', 'te Winkel, Mariel L', 'Fiocco, Martha', 'van den Akker, Erica L T', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter', 'van den Berg, Henk', 'Leeuw, Jan A', 'Bruin, Marrie C A', 'Bresters, Dorine', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['den Hoed MA', 'Pluijm SM', 'de Groot-Kruseman HA', 'te Winkel ML', 'Fiocco M', 'van den Akker EL', 'Hoogerbrugge P', 'van den Berg H', 'Leeuw JA', 'Bruin MC', 'Bresters D', 'Veerman AJ', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center;', ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Nijmegen, Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen.', 'Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam.', ""Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague University Medical Center Utrecht.', ""Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague Willem-Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague m.vandenheuvel@erasmusmc.nl.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141010,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Composition', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Thinness/*complications/*mortality', '*Weight Loss']",,,2014/10/12 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/10/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.110668 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.110668 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jan;100(1):62-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.110668.

Therefore, high level Mcl-1 usually confers human tumor cell resistance to ABT-737. At the present study, we observed that clitocine can induce apoptosis in six tested human colon cancer cell lines accompanied by suppression of Mcl-1. More interestingly, clitocine significantly enhances the ABT-737-mediated lethality by inducing apoptosis. At the molecular level we determined Mcl-1 is the potential target through which clitocine can sensitize human colon cancer cells to ABT-737 induced apoptosis. Knocking-down of Mcl-1 is sufficient to increase cancer cell susceptibility to ABT-737 while its over-expression can significantly reverse this susceptibility. We also determined that clitocine may activate Bak by disrupting the interaction between Mcl-1 and Bak to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, silence of Bak with the specific siRNA effectively attenuates the apoptosis induction by co-treatment of clitocine and ABT-737. Finally, clitocine in combination with ABT-737 significantly suppress the xenograft growth in animal model. Collectively, our studies suggest clitocine can induce apoptosis and potentiate ABT-737 lethality in human colon cancer cells by disrupting the interaction of Mcl-1 and Bak to trigger apoptosis.","['Sun, Jian-guo', 'Xiang, Jun', 'Zeng, Xue-li', 'Li, Xia', 'Wu, Ping', 'Fung, Kwok Pui', 'Liu, Fei-yan']","['Sun JG', 'Xiang J', 'Zeng XL', 'Li X', 'Wu P', 'Fung KP', 'Liu FY']","['Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China; Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China.', 'Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China.', 'Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China.', 'Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China.', 'Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China; Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China.', 'Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China; School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS)v, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.', 'Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China; Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, China.

Importantly, the mechanism of action of calicheamicin is fundamentally different from the tubulin-binding class of cytotoxics targeting the mitotic spindle, which represent the most common class of payloads for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) currently undergoing clinical development. Spindle poisons that target tubulin, including auristatins and maytansines, are most effective against rapidly proliferating cells. In contrast, calicheamicin induces DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis independent of cell cycle progression. Such properties may be advantageous when targeting malignant cells that are not markedly different in their proliferation status compared to normal cells. Here we review calicheamicin conjugates, with a particular focus on the preclinical- and clinical development of inotuzumab ozogamicin, targeting the CD22 antigen expressed on a large variety of hematologic malignancies. In pre-clinical experiments, inotuzumab ozogamicin potently induced tumor regressions in models of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), either alone or in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab. Promising anti-tumor responses were observed in early stage clinical trials, where inotuzumab ozogamicin was administered either as single agent or in combination with Rituximab. Consistent with the cell cycle independent mechanism of action of the calicheamicin payload, high rates of complete responses were observed in less aggressive forms of lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma (FL) and relapsed, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Inotuzumab ozogamicin is currently being tested in phase III clinical trials in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Particular focus is dedicated to reviewing the pre-clinical and clinical data generated with this compound in NHL and to outline future focus areas for pre-clinical- and clinical research of inotuzumab ozogamicin, and the calicheamicin class of antibody-drug conjugates more generally.","['Shor, Boris', 'Gerber, Hans-Peter', 'Sapra, Puja']","['Shor B', 'Gerber HP', 'Sapra P']","['Bioconjugates Discovery and Development, Oncology Research Unit, Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, 401 North Middletown Road, Pearl River, NY 10965, United States.', 'Bioconjugates Discovery and Development, Oncology Research Unit, Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, 401 North Middletown Road, Pearl River, NY 10965, United States.

Current standard practices for treatment of cancers are less than satisfactory because of CSCs-mediated recurrence. For this reason, targeting the CSCs or the cancer cells with CSCs-like properties has become the new approach for the cancer treatments. In addition to treating leukemia, arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) also suppresses other solid tumors. However, the roles of As(2)O(3) in the regulation of CSCs-like properties remain largely uninvestigated. Here by using sphere formation assay, luciferase reporter assay, and some other molecular biology approaches, we found that As(2)O(3) attenuated the CSCs-like properties in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Briefly, in HCC cells and mice xenograft models, As(2)O(3) improved the expression of miR-491 by DNA-demethylation. MiR-491, which targeted the SMAD3-3'-UTR, decreased the expressions of SMAD3, and inhibited the CSCs-like properties in HCC cells. Knockdown of either miR-491 or SMAD3 attenuated the As(2)O(3)-induced inhibition of endogenous transforming growth factor beta signal and the CSCs-like properties. Further, in HCC patients, miR-491 is inversely correlated with the expressions of SMAD3, CD133, and the metastasis/recurrence outcome. By understanding a novel mechanism whereby As(2)O(3) inhibits the CSCs-like properties in HCC, our study would help in the design of future strategies of developing As(2)O(3) as a potential HCC chemopreventive agent when used alone or in combination with other current drugs.","['Li, Yuan', 'Jiang, Fei', 'Liu, Qinqiang', 'Shen, Jian', 'Wang, Xingxing', 'Li, Zhong', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Lu, Xiang']","['Li Y', 'Jiang F', 'Liu Q', 'Shen J', 'Wang X', 'Li Z', 'Zhang J', 'Lu X']","['*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China zjpnjmu@hotmail.com.', '*The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Department of General Surgery and Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141010,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MIRN491 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Smad3 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic trioxide', 'cancer stem cells-like properties', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'microRNA-491', 'transforming growth factor beta']",2014/10/12 06:00,2016/01/06 06:00,['2014/10/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['kfu218 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfu218 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2015 Jan;143(1):156-64. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfu218.

Atherosclerotic events were retrospectively reported in patients with baseline cardiovascular risk factors during nilotinib treatment. We estimated the risk of developing atherosclerotic events in patients treated with second or first-line nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 48 months, by retrospectively applying the SCORE chart proposed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and evaluating risk factors at baseline (diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension). Overall, we enrolled in the study 82 CP patients treated frontline (42 CP patients at the dose of 600 mg BID) or after failure of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (40 CP patients treated with 400 mg BID). The SCORE chart is based on the stratification of sex (male vs female), age (from 40 to 65 years), smoker vs non-smoker, systolic pressure (from 120 to 180 mm Hg), and cholesterol (measured in mmol/l, from 150 to 300 mg/dl). For statistical purposes, we considered patients subdivided in low, moderate, high (with a score >5), and very high risk. There were 48 males and 34 females, median age 51 years (range 22-84). According to WHO classification, 42 patients were classified as normal weight (BMI <25), 26 patients were overweight (BMI 26 </= 30), and 14 were obese (BMI >30). Retrospective classification according to the SCORE chart revealed that 27 patients (33 %) were in the low-risk category, 30 patients (36 %) in the moderate risk category, and 24 patients (29 %) in the high risk. As regards risk factors, we revealed that 17 patients (20.7 %) had a concomitant type II controlled diabetes (without organ damage), 23 patients (28 %) were smokers, 29 patients (35 %) were receiving concomitant drugs for hypertension, and 15 patients (18 %) had concomitant dyslipidemia. Overall, the cumulative incidence of atherosclerotic events at 48 months was 8.5 % (95 % CI, 4.55-14.07): None of the low-risk patients according to the SCORE chart experienced atherosclerotic events compared to 10 % in the moderate risk category and 29 % in the high risk (p = 0.002). Atherosclerotic-free survival was 100, 89, and 69 % in the low, moderate, and high-risk population, respectively (p = 0.001). SCORE chart evaluation at disease baseline could be a valid tool to identify patients at high risk of atherosclerotic events during nilotinib treatment.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Zacheo, Irene', 'Serrao, Alessandra', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Molica M', 'Zacheo I', 'Serrao A', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy, breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141012,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Coronary Disease/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/12 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/12 06:00'],"['2014/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2231-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Mar;94(3):393-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2231-9.

Cancer is also associated with DNAm changes, which may contribute to disease development. Here, we speculate that age-associated DNAm changes may increase the risk of tumor initiation. Notably, when using epigenetic signatures for age-estimations tumor cells are often predicted to be much older than the chronological age of the patient. We demonstrate that aberrant hypermethylation within the gene DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) - which may contribute to initiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - is particularly observed in AML samples that reveal significantly more age-associated DNAm changes. The functional relevance of age-associated DNAm changes remains to be elucidated, but they occur genome wide, in a highly reproducible manner, and most likely influence chromatin organization - and hence may favor acquisition of aberrant DNAm patterns contributing to cancer in the elderly.","['Wagner, Wolfgang', 'Weidner, Carola I', 'Lin, Qiong']","['Wagner W', 'Weidner CI', 'Lin Q']","['Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141009,United States,Bioessays,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,,IM,"['Aging/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA-methylation', 'DNMT3A', 'aging', 'cancer', 'epigenetic', 'epimutation', 'predictor']",2014/10/11 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bies.201400063 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioessays. 2015 Jan;37(1):20-4. doi: 10.1002/bies.201400063.

Serum electrophoresis was performed in 65 patients at presentation, of whom 17 (26%) had a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. Two cases developed haematological malignancies, acute myeloid leukaemia and duodenal plasmacytoma, 18 and 36 months after presenting with acute hepatitis E infection. CONCLUSIONS: A range of extra-hepatic manifestations can occur with hepatitis E. Neurological and haematological features of hepatitis E infection are relatively frequent in this UK cohort, and result in significant morbidity which warrants further study.","['Woolson, K L', 'Forbes, A', 'Vine, L', 'Beynon, L', 'McElhinney, L', 'Panayi, V', 'Hunter, J G', 'Madden, R G', 'Glasgow, T', 'Kotecha, A', 'Dalton, H C', 'Mihailescu, L', 'Warshow, U', 'Hussaini, H S', 'Palmer, J', 'Mclean, B N', 'Haywood, B', 'Bendall, R P', 'Dalton, H R']","['Woolson KL', 'Forbes A', 'Vine L', 'Beynon L', 'McElhinney L', 'Panayi V', 'Hunter JG', 'Madden RG', 'Glasgow T', 'Kotecha A', 'Dalton HC', 'Mihailescu L', 'Warshow U', 'Hussaini HS', 'Palmer J', 'Mclean BN', 'Haywood B', 'Bendall RP', 'Dalton HR']","['Cornwall Gastrointestinal Unit, Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro, Cornwall, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141010,England,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,8707234,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hematologic Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis E/*epidemiology/*pathology/physiopathology/psychology', 'Hepatitis E virus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nervous System Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Symptom Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/apt.12986 [doi]'],ppublish,Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2014 Dec;40(11-12):1282-91. doi: 10.1111/apt.12986.

The presence of at least one of the non-functional ITPA alleles (94C>A and/or IVS2+21A>C variant) was associated with longer event-free survival compared to patients with the wild-type ITPA genotype (p = 0.033). Furthermore, patients carrying at least one non-functional ITPA allele were shown to be at a lower risk of suffering early (p = 0.003) and/or bone marrow relapse (p = 0.017).

Whether different pre-induction leucoreduction strategies can improve outcome is unknown. A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted on AML patients with a white blood cell count (WBC) >100 x 10(9) /l between 1987 and 1997, and on all AML patients between 1998 and 2006, to determine (a) the effect of four different leucoreductive strategies (leukapheresis, hydroxycarbamide, leukapheresis and hydroxycarbamide or no pre-induction leucoreduction) on early (day 28) mortality, CR, and OS; and (b) whether a high presenting WBC remains a negative predictor of OS in patients surviving induction (first 28 d). In the 1998-2006 cohort (n = 702), higher WBC was associated with higher early mortality and lower OS but its effects were greatly diminished in patients who survived the first 28 d (Hazard Ratio 1.094 vs. 1.002). A WBC of 34.1 x 10(9) /l had the highest sensitivity (75.6%) and specificity (67.4%) for early mortality. None of the four leucoreduction strategies differed significantly in early mortality, CR, or OS in patients with WBC>100 x 10(9) /l (n = 166). The number of leucostatic signs was a significant predictor of early mortality (P < 0.0001) and OS (P = 0.0007).

There are few data regarding the pharmacodynamics of cytarabine. The only publications regarding this issue cite a biphasic pattern of decline in white blood cell (WBC) counts following low and intermediate doses, in patients with various malignancies, most of them non-haematological. Our purpose was to establish the pharmacodynamics of cytarabine induced leucopenia in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients treated with contemporary cytarabine containing protocols. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, including 56 patients with AML in complete remission who had received 89 cycles of intermediate or high dose cytarabine. Daily counts for WBCs and neutrophils (ANC) were collected during the first 15 days after the initiation of cytarabine administration and pharmacodynamics were analyzed. Further analysis was carried out to correlate between WBC and ANC pharmacodynamics and different cytarabine protocols [high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) vs. intermediate dose cytarabine (IDAC)]. RESULTS: Analysis of blood counts demonstrated a monophasic decline of WBCs and ANCs, unlike a previous depiction of a biphasic pattern. HiDAC was associated with a significantly sharper decline of WBCs than IDAC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a monophasic decline pattern of WBCs and ANCs following contemporary cytarabine protocols. The decline rate is steeper for patients receiving HiDAC than for those receiving IDAC. These results might help form evidence based guidelines regarding patient monitoring intensity, timing of prophylactic antibacterial and antifungal treatment as well as growth factors' support following cytarabine based consolidation for AML.","['Shepshelovich, Daniel', 'Edel, Yonatan', 'Goldvaser, Hadar', 'Dujovny, Tal', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Raanani, Pia']","['Shepshelovich D', 'Edel Y', 'Goldvaser H', 'Dujovny T', 'Wolach O', 'Raanani P']","['Medicine A, Rabin Medical Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukopenia/blood/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'cytarabine', 'leucopenia', 'pharmacodynamics']",2014/10/11 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcp.12530 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Apr;79(4):685-91. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12530.,['(c) 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.'],,PMC4386953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate the impact of SNPs within the MTX pathway genes on MTX-induced toxicity and MTX plasma levels at 48 h following treatment in Asian adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. PATIENTS & METHODS: Patients (n = 71) were genotyped for MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, SLC19A1 G80A, ABCG2 C421A and ABCB1 C3435T using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Plasma MTX concentrations at 48 h were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients had hematopoietic toxicity, 51 had hepatic toxicity and 36 had mucositis. Patients homozygous for MTHFR 677TT were associated with increased risk of both hematopoietic (odds ratio [OR]: 9.03; 95% CI: 2.28-36.16; p = 0.002) and hepatic (OR: 3.92; 95% CI: 1.01-15.11; p = 0.036) toxicities. Hepatic toxicity was associated with SLC19A1 G80A (OR: 5.27, 95% CI: 1.21-22.72; p = 0.032) and ABCB1 C3435T (OR: 8.62; 95% CI: 1.96-37.57; p = 0.004). However, polymorphisms in MTHFR A1298C and ABCG2 C421A were not associated with any of the toxicities, and mucositis was not associated with any polymorphisms of the MTX pathway genes. Patients with MTHFR C677T and ABCB1 C3435T polymorphisms appear to have significantly higher MTX plasma concentrations (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results in Asian adults provides evidence for the contribution pharmacogenetics to the toxicity of high-dose MTX and plasma MTX concentrations at 48 h following treatment in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These results will contribute towards the effort of MTX therapy individualization.","['Suthandiram, Sujatha', 'Gan, Gin-Gin', 'Zain, Shamsul Mohd', 'Bee, Ping-Chong', 'Lian, Lay-Hoong', 'Chang, Kian-Meng', 'Ong, Tee-Chuan', 'Mohamed, Zahurin']","['Suthandiram S', 'Gan GG', 'Zain SM', 'Bee PC', 'Lian LH', 'Chang KM', 'Ong TC', 'Mohamed Z']","['The Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Asians/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['NHL', 'SNP', 'high-dose methotrexate', 'methotrexate plasma concentration', 'methotrexate toxicity', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",2014/10/11 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/pgs.14.97 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2014 Aug;15(11):1479-94. doi: 10.2217/pgs.14.97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, murine APOBEC1 was shown to inhibit Friend retrovirus (FV) in vitro, generating high levels of C-to-T and G-to-A mutations. These observations raised the possibility that FV infection might be altered in APOBEC1-null mice. To examine this question directly, we infected wild-type and APOBEC1-null mice with FV complex and evaluated acute infection levels. Surprisingly, APOBEC1-null mice exhibited similar cellular infection levels and plasma viremia relative to wild-type mice. Moreover, next-generation sequencing analyses revealed that in contrast to APOBEC3, APOBEC1 did not enhance retroviral C-to-T and G-to-A mutational frequencies in genomic DNA. Thus, APOBEC1 neither inhibited nor significantly drove the molecular evolution of FV in vivo. Our findings reinforce that not all retrovirus restriction factors characterized as potent in vitro may be functionally relevant in vivo.","['Barrett, Bradley S', 'Guo, Kejun', 'Harper, Michael S', 'Li, Sam X', 'Heilman, Karl J', 'Davidson, Nicholas O', 'Santiago, Mario L']","['Barrett BS', 'Guo K', 'Harper MS', 'Li SX', 'Heilman KJ', 'Davidson NO', 'Santiago ML']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

We hypothesize that the biological differences in the subtypes of AMKL may be reflected in distinct immunophenotypic (IP) features. Our aims were to employ mutiparameter flow cytometry to establish a comprehensive IP spectrum of AMKL in multiple demographic groups and to determine whether the subtypes of AMKL demonstrate distinct immunophenotypes. Methods: Thirty-seven AMKL cases were retrieved and subdivided into these three groups. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to determine and compare the immunophenotypes. Available clinical, cytogenetic, and morphologic data were reviewed to confirm diagnoses. Results: While there is commonality in the expression pattern for a wide range of myelomonocytic markers in these three subtypes of AMKL, blasts in DS-AMKL were more likely to express CD7 and CD11b than those in non-DS-AMKL and adult-AMKL. Furthermore, blasts in DS-AMKL were more likely to express CD13, CD33 and CD36 than non-DS pediatric AMKL, and showed greater CD56 expression compared to adult AMKL. Conclusions: These results indicate that DS-AMKL is related to but immunophenotypically distinct from non-DS-AMKL and adult-AMKL. This distinct immunophenotypic pattern, co-expression of CD7 and CD11b, has practical implications for characterization of AMKL.

In a previous study investigating multiple types of cells from brain and kidney of the mouse (Acta Neuropathologica 2004; 107: 257-264), we found increased unrepaired nuclear DNA single strand breaks (nDNA SSB) only in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus in the brain using autoradiographic methods after a continuous eight-week 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) exposure of adult mice with flux density of 1.5 mT. METHODS: In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MF exposure with lower flux densities (0.1 mT, i.e., the actual exposure limit for the population in most European countries, and 1.0 mT) shows similar results to those in the previous study. Experiments and data analysis were carried out in a similar way as in our previous study. RESULTS: Continuous eight-week 50 Hz MF exposure with 0.1 mT or 1.0 mT did not result in increased persisting unrepaired nDNA SSB in distinct types of cells in the brain, kidney, and liver of adult mice. MF exposure with 1.0 mT led to reduced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in epithelial cells in the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle in the brain (EC-CP) and epithelial cells of the cortical collecting duct in the kidney, as well as to reduced mtDNA synthesis in neurons of the caudate nucleus in the brain and in EC-CP. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found for increased persisting unrepaired nDNA SSB in distinct types of cells in the brain, kidney, and liver of adult mice after continuous eight-week 50 Hz magnetic field exposure with flux density of 0.1 mT or 1.0 mT.","['Korr, Hubert', 'Angstman, Nicholas B', 'Born, Tatjana B', 'Bosse, Kerstin', 'Brauns, Birka', 'Demmler, Martin', 'Fueller, Katja', 'Kantor, Orsolya', 'Kever, Barbara M', 'Rahimyar, Navida', 'Salimi, Sepideh', 'Silny, Jiri', 'Schmitz, Christoph']","['Korr H', 'Angstman NB', 'Born TB', 'Bosse K', 'Brauns B', 'Demmler M', 'Fueller K', 'Kantor O', 'Kever BM', 'Rahimyar N', 'Salimi S', 'Silny J', 'Schmitz C']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neuroanatomy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Femu, Institute of Occupational and Social Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Department of Neuroanatomy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141010,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/cytology/*radiation effects', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/*radiation effects', 'Kidney/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Liver/cytology/*radiation effects', '*Magnetic Fields', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neurons/cytology/radiation effects']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109774 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-29033 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 10;9(10):e109774. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109774. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4193825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-Glycoprotein inhibition was quantified using a doxorubicin accumulation assay in human promyelotic leukemia HL60/MDR cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein. A preliminary quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis revealed three main structural features involved in P-glycoprotein inhibition: a 1,2,3-trimethoxy moiety, a 6-acyloxy group, and the absence of a 7-hydroxy group. The most effective inhibitors, (-)-gomisin N (1) and (+)-deoxyschizandrin [(+)-2], were selected for further evaluation of their effects.

The addition of arsenic trioxide (ato) in the relapsed setting-and, more recently, in reduced-chemotherapy or chemotherapy-free approaches in the first-line setting-continues to improve treatment outcomes by reducing some of the toxicities associated with anthracycline-based approaches. Despite those successes, a high rate of early death from complications of coagulopathy remains the primary cause of treatment failure before treatment begins. In addition to that pressing issue, clarity is needed about the use of ato in the first-line setting and the role of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) in the relapsed setting. The aim for the present consensus was to provide guidance to health care professionals about strategies to reduce the early death rate, information on the indications for hsct and on the use of ato in induction and consolidation in low-to-intermediate-risk and high-risk apl patients.","['Seftel, M D', 'Barnett, M J', 'Couban, S', 'Leber, B', 'Storring, J', 'Assaily, W', 'Fuerth, B', 'Christofides, A', 'Schuh, A C']","['Seftel MD', 'Barnett MJ', 'Couban S', 'Leber B', 'Storring J', 'Assaily W', 'Fuerth B', 'Christofides A', 'Schuh AC']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC.', 'Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS.', 'McMaster University, Hamilton, ON.', 'McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC.', 'New Evidence, Toronto, ON.', 'New Evidence, Toronto, ON.', 'New Evidence, Toronto, ON.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Trisenox', 'allogeneic transplantation', 'apl', 'arsenic trioxide', 'ato', 'autologous transplantation', 'first-line treatment', 'infusions', 'management', 'prophylaxis', 'supportive care', 'transplantation']",2014/10/11 06:00,2014/10/11 06:01,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.21.2183 [doi]', 'conc-21-234 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2014 Oct;21(5):234-50. doi: 10.3747/co.21.2183.,,,PMC4189564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined receipt of initial cancer treatment for a population-based sample of 504 AYAs diagnosed in 2007-2008 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ cell cancer, or sarcoma. Registry data, patient surveys, and detailed medical record reviews were used to evaluate the association of patient demographic, socioeconomic, and health care setting characteristics with receipt of appropriate initial treatment, which was defined by clinical specialists in AYA oncology based on adult guidelines and published literature available before 2009 and analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Approximately 75% of AYA cancer patients in our sample received appropriate treatment, 68% after excluding stage I male germ cell patients who all received appropriate treatment. After this exclusion, appropriate treatment ranged from 79% of sarcoma patients to 56% of ALL patients. Cancer type (P < .01) and clinical trial participation (P = .04) were statistically significantly associated with appropriate treatment in multivariable analyses. Patients enrolled in clinical trials were more likely to receive appropriate therapy relative to those not enrolled (78% vs 67%, adjusted odds ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.1 to 6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Except for those with early stage male germ cell tumors, approximately 30% (or 3 in 10) AYA cancer patients did not receive appropriate therapy. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons for this potential shortfall in care delivery.","['Potosky, Arnold L', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Albritton, Karen', 'Cress, Rosemary D', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Hamilton, Ann S', 'Kato, Ikuko', 'Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Keel, Gretchen', 'Schwartz, Stephen M', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Shnorhavorian, Margarett', 'West, Michele M', 'Wu, Xiao-Cheng']","['Potosky AL', 'Harlan LC', 'Albritton K', 'Cress RD', 'Friedman DL', 'Hamilton AS', 'Kato I', 'Keegan TH', 'Keel G', 'Schwartz SM', 'Seibel NL', 'Shnorhavorian M', 'West MM', 'Wu XC']","[""Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC (ALP);

In addition, we have shown that fetal bovine serum (FBS) induces Yes auto-phosphorylation and activation. In the present study we confirm that serum also activates TEAD-dependent transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and we identify Inter-alpha-inhibitor (IalphaI) as a component in serum capable of activating the Yes/YAP/TEAD pathway by inducing Yes auto-phosphorylation, YAP nuclear localization and TEAD-dependent transcription. The cleaved heavy chain 2 (HC2) sub-component of IalphaI, is demonstrated to be responsible for this effect. Moreover, IalphaI is also shown to efficiently increase expression of TEAD-downstream target genes including well-known stem cell factors Nanog and Oct 3/4. IalphaI is not produced by the ES cells per se but is added to the cells via the cell culture medium containing serum or serum-derived components such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). In conclusion, we describe a novel function of IalphaI in activating key pluripotency pathways associated with ES cell maintenance and self-renewal.","['Pijuan-Galito, Sara', 'Tamm, Christoffer', 'Anneren, Cecilia']","['Pijuan-Galito S', 'Tamm C', 'Anneren C']","['From the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, SE-75 123 Uppsala, Sweden and.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, SE-75 123 Uppsala, Sweden and.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, SE-75 123 Uppsala, Sweden and GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, SE-751 84 Uppsala, Sweden cecilia.anneren@imbim.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141009,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Alpha-Globulins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (TEA Domain Transcription Factors)', '0 (TEAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Tead2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Yap1 protein, mouse)', '39346-44-6 (inter-alpha-inhibitor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (YES1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Yes1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Alpha-Globulins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes/genetics/*metabolism', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell Culture', 'Cell Signaling', 'Embryonic Stem Cell', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Inter-alpha-inhibitor', 'TEAD', 'Transfection', 'YAP', 'Yes']",2014/10/11 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47425-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.580076 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Nov 28;289(48):33492-502. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.580076.

We previously demonstrated that besides playing a role in drug-resistant leukemia cell lines, multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4) regulates leukemia cell proliferation and differentiation through the endogenous MRP4/ABCC4 substrate, cAMP. Here, we studied the role of MRP4/ABCC4 in tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model and in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) differentiation. We found a decrease in the mitotic index and an increase in the apoptotic index associated with the inhibition of tumor growth when mice were treated with rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) and/or probenecid (MRPs inhibitor). Genetic silencing and pharmacologic inhibition of MRP4 reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, MRP4 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vivo. Interestingly, when LSC population was isolated, we observed that increased cAMP levels and MRP4/ABCC4 blockade resulted in LSCs differentiation. Taken together, our findings show that MRP4/ABCC4 has a relevant role in tumor growth and apoptosis and in the eradication of LSCs, providing the basis for a novel promising target in AML therapy.","['Copsel, Sabrina', 'Bruzzone, Ariana', 'May, Maria', 'Beyrath, Julien', 'Wargon, Victoria', 'Cany, Jeannette', 'Russel, Frans G M', 'Shayo, Carina', 'Davio, Carlos']","['Copsel S', 'Bruzzone A', 'May M', 'Beyrath J', 'Wargon V', 'Cany J', 'Russel FG', 'Shayo C', 'Davio C']","['Instituto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

XmAb5574 (aka MOR00208) is a novel humanized CD19 monoclonal antibody with an engineered Fc region to enhance Fcgamma receptor binding affinity. Here we report results of a first in human phase 1 trial of XmAb5574 in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled to 6 escalating dose levels, with expansion at the highest dose level of 12 mg/kg. Nine doses of XmAb5574 were infused over 8 weeks. No maximal tolerated dose was reached, and the drug was generally well tolerated, with infusion reactions of grades 1 and 2 being the most common toxicities. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities occurred in 5 patients and included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, febrile neutropenia, and tumor lysis syndrome. XmAb5574 showed preliminary efficacy, with 18 patients (66.7%) responding by physical examination criteria and laboratory studies, and 8 patients (29.6%) responding by computed tomography criteria. Pharmacokinetics showed a half-life of 14 days with clearance that was not dose-dependent. In conclusion, this phase 1 trial demonstrates safety and preliminary efficacy of a novel Fc-engineered CD19 monoclonal antibody XmAb5574 and justifies movement into the phase 2 setting.

Currently, treatment algorithms for HR-CLL are being challenged by the introduction of novel classes of drugs. Among them, BCR signal inhibitors (BCRi) and B-cell lymphoma 2 antagonists (BCL2a) appear particularly promising. As a result of the growing body of favorable outcome data reported for BCRi/BCL2a, uncertainty is emerging on how to advise patients with HR-CLL about indication for and timing of HSCT. This article provides an overview of currently available evidence and theoretical considerations to guide this difficult decision process. Until the risks and benefits of different treatment strategies are settled, all patients with HR-CLL should be considered for treatment with BCRi/BCL2a. For patients who respond to these agents, there are 2 treatment possibilities: (1) performing an HSCT or (2) continuing treatment with the novel drug. Individual disease-specific and transplant-related risk factors, along with patient's preferences, should be taken into account when recommending one of these treatments over the other.","['Dreger, Peter', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Andersen, Niels', 'Corradini, Paolo', 'van Gelder, Michel', 'Gribben, John', 'Kimby, Eva', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Dreger P', 'Schetelig J', 'Andersen N', 'Corradini P', 'van Gelder M', 'Gribben J', 'Kimby E', 'Michallet M', 'Moreno C', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Montserrat E']","['Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department Medicine I, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany; German Bone Marrow Donor Registry, Tubingen, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Department Hematology and Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy;', 'Department Internal Medicine/Hematology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands;', 'Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Medicine/Hematology Unit, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden;', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Lyon, France;"", 'Hospital de la Santa Creu Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain;', 'Department Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141009,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Decision Making', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Genes, p53', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39549-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-07-586826 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 18;124(26):3841-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-07-586826.

However, therapy-resistant or refractory T-ALL remains a major clinical challenge. Here, we evaluated B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 inhibition by the BH3 mimetic ABT-199 as a new therapeutic strategy in human T-ALL. The T-ALL cell line LOUCY, which shows a transcriptional program related to immature T-ALL, exhibited high in vitro and in vivo sensitivity for ABT-199 in correspondence with high levels of BCL-2. In addition, ABT-199 showed synergistic therapeutic effects with different chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin, l-asparaginase, and dexamethasone. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of primary patient samples indicated that some immature, TLX3- or HOXA-positive primary T-ALLs are highly sensitive to BCL-2 inhibition, whereas TAL1 driven tumors mostly showed poor ABT-199 responses. Because BCL-2 shows high expression in early T-cell precursors and gradually decreases during normal T-cell differentiation, differences in ABT-199 sensitivity could partially be mediated by distinct stages of differentiation arrest between different molecular genetic subtypes of human T-ALL. In conclusion, our study highlights BCL-2 as an attractive molecular target in specific subtypes of human T-ALL that could be exploited by ABT-199.","['Peirs, Sofie', 'Matthijssens, Filip', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Van de Walle, Inge', 'Ruggero, Katia', 'de Bock, Charles E', 'Degryse, Sandrine', 'Cante-Barrett, Kirsten', 'Briot, Delphine', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Lammens, Tim', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Meijerink, Jules P', 'Cools, Jan', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Rabbitts, Terence H', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Peirs S', 'Matthijssens F', 'Goossens S', 'Van de Walle I', 'Ruggero K', 'de Bock CE', 'Degryse S', 'Cante-Barrett K', 'Briot D', 'Clappier E', 'Lammens T', 'De Moerloose B', 'Benoit Y', 'Poppe B', 'Meijerink JP', 'Cools J', 'Soulier J', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Taghon T', 'Speleman F', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['Center for Medical Genetics.', 'Center for Medical Genetics.', 'Flanders Institute for Biotechnology Inflammation Research Center, and.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Medical Research Council Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, England, United Kingdom;', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium;', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium;', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', ""Genome Rearrangements and Cancer Laboratory, U462 INSERM, Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; and."", ""Genome Rearrangements and Cancer Laboratory, U462 INSERM, Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; and."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium;', ""Genome Rearrangements and Cancer Laboratory, U462 INSERM, Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; and."", 'Medical Research Council Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, England, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium;', 'Center for Medical Genetics.', 'Center for Medical Genetics.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141009,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39582-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-574566 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 11;124(25):3738-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-574566.

Standard methods were employed to identify clonal aberrations by conventional cytogenetics (CC). The B-CLL fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel comprised ATM, CEP12, D13S25, and TP53 probes. DSP30 + IL2 cultures had a higher chromosomal abnormality detection rate (67 %) compared to TPA (44 %, p < 0.001). The mean number of analyzable metaphases and abnormal metaphases per slide was also higher (p < 0.005, p < 0.001, respectively). Culture success rate, percentage of complex karyotype, and percentage of non-clonal abnormal cell were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Thirteen cases with abnormalities were found exclusively in DSP30 + IL2 cultures compared to one found solely in TPA cultures. DSP30 + IL2 cultures were comparable to the FISH panel in detecting 11q-, +12 and 17p- but not 13q-. It also has a predilection for 11q- bearing leukemic cells compared to TPA. FISH had a higher abnormality detection rate (84.1 %) compared to CC (66.0 %) with borderline significance (p = 0.051), albeit limited by its coverage. In conclusion, DSP30 + IL2 showed a higher abnormality detection rate.

In order to characterize the current cancer burden due to tobacco use, this study provides recent trends in tobacco-related cancer incidence across the US. We analyzed data from CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, covering 100% of the US population during 2005-2009. Age-adjusted incidence rates, 95% confidence intervals and annual percent change were calculated for each state, the District of Columbia, and the US. Tobacco-related cancer incidence in the US decreased significantly from 152.9 (per 100,000 persons) in 2005 to 145.8 in 2009. Men had higher incidence rates, but a greater decrease in tobacco-related cancers per year over the 5-year time period (-1.4% in men, compared to -0.8% in women). Incidence rates decreased the most per year for larynx (-2.4%), lung and bronchus (-1.9%) and stomach (-1.5%) cancers during the study period. Tobacco-related cancer incidence trends varied by state. While tobacco-related cancer incidence in the United States decreased overall from 2005 to 2009, tobacco continued to account for a large cancer burden. Our findings suggest that continued efforts in tobacco prevention and control are needed to further reduce tobacco-related cancer burden in general and among targeted sub-populations in the US.","['Underwood, J Michael', 'Richards, Thomas B', 'Henley, S Jane', 'Momin, Behnoosh', 'Houston, Keisha', 'Rolle, Italia', 'Holmes, Carissa', 'Stewart, Sherri L']","['Underwood JM', 'Richards TB', 'Henley SJ', 'Momin B', 'Houston K', 'Rolle I', 'Holmes C', 'Stewart SL']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway, N.E., Atlanta, GA, 30341, USA, jmunderwood@cdc.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,J Community Health,Journal of community health,7600747,,IM,"['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'Smoking/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2016/02/03 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10900-014-9951-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Community Health. 2015 Jun;40(3):414-8. doi: 10.1007/s10900-014-9951-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to investigate associations of miR-335 expression with tumor progression and prognosis in pediatric AML. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-335 in bone marrow mononuclear cells and serum obtained from patients with pediatric AML and healthy controls. RESULTS: Expression levels of miR-335 in the bone marrow and serum of pediatric AML patients were both significantly higher than those in normal controls (both P < 0.001). Then, high serum miR-335 level occurred more frequently in French-American-British classification subtype M7 subtype than in other subtypes (P = 0.03). The expression of serum miR-335 in pediatric AML patients with unfavorable karyotypes was also significantly higher than those in intermediate and favorable groups (P = 0.008). Moreover, high serum miR-335 level was markedly associated with shorter relapse-free and overall survivals (both P < 0.001) of patients with pediatric AML. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis identified the serum miR-335 and cytogenetics risk as independent prognostic factors for both relapse-free and overall survivals. More importantly, the prognostic relevance of serum miR-335 expression was more obvious in the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: Our data offer the convincing evidence for the first time that serum miR-335 level may be markedly and consistently increased in pediatric AML patients. Serum miR-335 may serve as a promising marker for monitoring the progression and predicting the clinical outcome of patients with this disease.","['Lin, X', 'Wang, Z', 'Zhang, R', 'Feng, W']","['Lin X', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang R', 'Feng W']","[""Department of Paediatric Intensive Care Units, Huai'an Maternity and Child Health Hospital of Yangzhou University, Huai'an, 223002, Jiangsu Province, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141010,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (MIRN335 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/classification/genetics/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2016/02/20 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12094-014-1237-z [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2015 May;17(5):358-64. doi: 10.1007/s12094-014-1237-z.

The mechanisms of beta cell destruction in vivo, however, remain unclear. We aimed to test the relative roles of the main cell death pathways: apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis, in beta cell death in the development of CD4(+) T cell-mediated autoimmune diabetes. METHODS: We altered expression levels of critical cell death proteins in mouse islets and tested their ability to survive CD4(+) T cell-mediated attack using an in vivo graft model. RESULTS: Loss of the B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) homology domain 3-only proteins BIM, PUMA or BID did not protect beta cells from this death. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 or combined deficiency of the pro-apoptotic multi-BCL2 homology domain proteins BAX and BAK also failed to prevent beta cell destruction. Furthermore, loss of function of the death receptor Fas or its essential downstream signalling molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) in islets was also not protective. Using electron microscopy we observed that dying beta cells showed features of necrosis. However, islets deficient in receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), a critical initiator of necroptosis, were still normally susceptible to CD4(+) T cell-mediated destruction. Remarkably, simultaneous inhibition of apoptosis and necroptosis by combining loss of RIPK3 and overexpression of BCL-2 in islets did not protect them against immune attack either. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our data indicate that beta cells die by necrosis in autoimmune diabetes and that the programmed cell death pathways apoptosis and necroptosis are both dispensable for this process.","['Zhao, Yuxing', 'Scott, Nicholas A', 'Fynch, Stacey', 'Elkerbout, Lorraine', 'Wong, W Wei-Lynn', 'Mason, Kylie D', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Huang, David C', 'Kay, Thomas W H', 'Thomas, Helen E']","['Zhao Y', 'Scott NA', 'Fynch S', 'Elkerbout L', 'Wong WW', 'Mason KD', 'Strasser A', 'Huang DC', 'Kay TW', 'Thomas HE']","[""St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, 41 Victoria Parade, Fitzroy, Melbourne, VIC, 3065, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141010,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ripk3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Autoimmunity/*physiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Islets of Langerhans/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Necrosis/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Death Domain/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00125-014-3407-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2015 Jan;58(1):140-8. doi: 10.1007/s00125-014-3407-5.

But, the development of drug resistance has been reported as one of the major setbacks in oncology. This study focused on the mechanisms leading to secondary resistance by assessing the gene expression of BCL2 family proteins which are associated with the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. 8 genes were investigated in erlotinib and gefitinib treated cells by real time PCR and protein analysis by western blotting. The cells were exposed to the test drugs 48h prior to RNA or protein isolation. It was observed that BIM-EL, a pro-apoptotic protein was up-regulated in cells sensitive to the drugs but not in the resistant cells. On the other hand BCL2-alpha, an anti-apoptotic protein was up-regulated in the resistant cells and not in the sensitive cells. BCL2-alpha revealed a counter-regulation effect on BIM-EL and this effect is probably one of the causes of secondary resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib.","['Simasi, Jacinta', 'Oelkrug, Christopher', 'Schubert, Andreas', 'Nieber, Karen', 'Gillissen, Adrian']","['Simasi J', 'Oelkrug C', 'Schubert A', 'Nieber K', 'Gillissen A']","['Fraunhofer-Institut fur Zelltherapie und Immunologie, Leipzig, Germany; Institut fur Pharmazie, Universitat Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.

Although HHT was investigated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the 1990s with good results, the advent of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) at that time rapidly established a new standard of care for CML. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate is a semisynthetic derivative of HHT with known clinical activity in relapsed or refractory CML following TKI therapy. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize the biologic effects of HHT and its derivative, omacetaxine, in CML. Additionally, we analyze the concepts learned from the early trials using these drugs. Data from clinical trials resulting in drug approval are also reviewed.

The ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) gene codes for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane-bound efflux transporter known to affect the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. IM is a substrate of the P-gp-mediated efflux. ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported as modulators of ABCB1-mediated transport, affecting IM's bioavailability and consequently the treatment outcome of IM therapy. We aimed to examine the association between ABCB1 SNPs and the likelihood of achieving optimal response in IM-treated CML patients. Three ABCB1 SNPs (C1236T, G2677T, and C3435T) were genotyped in 100 Egyptian patients with CML undergoing IM therapy using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The optimal response rate did not differ significantly between C1236T, G2677T, or C3435T genotypes (P > 0.05). Optimal response rate was significantly different among patients with the CGC, TTT, TGC, CGT, TGT, CTC, CTT, and TTC haplotypes (P = 0.023). The 1236T-2677G-3435T haplotype was significantly associated with lower probability of achieving optimal response (P = 0.001). ABCB1 SNPs haplotype analysis should be taken into account in an attempt to get clearer insights into who is likely to respond optimally to IM for identifying CML patients who may not respond optimally to standard-dose IM therapy and potentially need an individualized therapeutic approach.","['Ali, Mohamed A M', 'Elsalakawy, Walaa Ali']","['Ali MA', 'Elsalakawy WA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Abbassia, Cairo, 11566, Egypt, mohd_ali2@sci.asu.edu.eg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141011,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Haplotypes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/11 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0279-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Nov;31(11):279. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0279-y.

After HSCT, TKIs are increasingly being used to treat or prevent disease relapse, and practice patterns suggest that these TKIs are often chosen empirically without regard to pre-HSCT mutation status. We investigated whether ABL kinase domain mutations persist after transplantation and, thus, whether pre-HSCT mutation status should inform the selection of post-HSCT TKIs in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed adults who underwent allogeneic HSCT for CML and Ph + ALL at our institution between 2000 and 2010, and we identified subjects who had detectable BCR-ABL transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as available RNA for Sanger sequencing of the ABL kinase domain, in both the pre- and post-HSCT settings. In total, 95 CML and 20 Ph + ALL patients with positive PCR transcripts were identified, of which 10 (10.5%) and 4 (20.0%), respectively, were found to have pre-HSCT ABL kinase mutations known to confer TKI resistance. In 9 (64.2%) of these 14 patients, the same kinase mutation was also detectable at an average time of 191 days after HSCT. Seven (50.0%) of the 14 harboring mutations had relapsed/refractory disease by last follow-up, of which, in retrospect, 6 had received a predictably ineffective TKI within the first 100 days after transplantation based on our mutation analysis. These data support the idea that pre-existing mutations in the ABL kinase domain, frequently associated with resistance to TKIs and prevalent in a transplantation population, are persistently detectable in the majority of patients after transplantation. We propose that such resistance patterns should be considered when selecting TKIs in the post-HSCT setting, including clinical trials of post-HSCT TKI prophylaxis.","['Egan, Daniel N', 'Beppu, Lan', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Egan DN', 'Beppu L', 'Radich JP']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.

Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment is crucial to restrict the extent of disease. However, a subset of patients may not meet all current diagnostic criteria at presentation, and waiting for these to be met may delay therapy. We retrospectively reviewed 794 HSCT patients treated at our institution between 2003 and 2013, identifying 17 (2.1%) who developed VOD. Of these, 5 (29%) were noted to have an absence of elevated bilirubin at the time of VOD diagnosis and reversal of portal venous flow on ultrasound. Median total and conjugated bilirubin at VOD diagnosis were 1.0 and 0.2 mg/dL, respectively. All 5 patients were subsequently diagnosed with multiorgan failure associated with VOD, including 1 with encephalopathy. Four were treated with intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone (500 mg/m(2) per dose every 12 hours for 6 doses). One patient received defibrotide therapy in addition to steroids and another supportive care alone. VOD resolved in 4 of 5 patients, with median time to resolution of VOD, defined as recovery of all organ function and normalization of bilirubin and portal venous flow, of 8 days. Two patients died later from progressive primary disease and chronic graft-versus-host disease, respectively. We conclude that a high index of suspicion for VOD should be maintained in patients despite lack of bilirubin elevation in the presence of other diagnostic criteria such as hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, ascites, or weight gain. Early ultrasound evaluation in these patients may lead to more timely diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.","['Myers, Kasiani C', 'Dandoy, Christopher', 'El-Bietar, Javier', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Jodele, Sonata']","['Myers KC', 'Dandoy C', 'El-Bietar J', 'Davies SM', 'Jodele S']","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Among 400 AML patients, two cases of Ph+ AML (0.5%) were identified and treated with conventional chemotherapy with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). One patient had a complex karyotype including 7 monosomy (-7) and p190 BCR-ABL fusion transcript. Both patients remain in complete molecular remission. To date, 21 Ph+ AML cases treated with TKIs have been described in the literature with a median overall survival of 18months. One-third of the patients had additional karyotypic abnormalities, and 14% had -7. Molecular analysis showed 59% p210 and 41% p190 fusion protein. Relapse rate was observed in 38% of patients with p190 compared to 10% in patients with p210. Allo-HSCT was performed in eight patients; two relapsed (25%).

The intra-alveolar lipoproteinaceous material was subsequently proven to have been derived from pulmonary surfactant in 1980 by Singh et al. Levinson et al. also reported in 1958 the case of 19-year-old female with panmyelosis afflicted with a diffuse pulmonary disease characterized by filling of the alveoli with amorphous material described as ""intra-alveolar coagulum"". This is probably the first reported case of PAP in relation to hematologic malignancy. Much progress has been made on PAP first described by Rosen which is currently classified as idiopathic or primary or autoimmune PAP. Idiopathic PAP occurs as a result of auto-antibodies directed against granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) impeding the surfactant clearing function of alveolar macrophages leading to progressive respiratory failure. Whole lung lavage and GM-CSF therapy has improved outcomes in patients with idiopathic PAP. Despite major advancement in the management of hematologic malignancy and its complications, little is known about the type of PAP first described by Levinson and now known as secondary PAP; a term also used when PAP occurs due to other causes such as occupational dusts. In this article we review and analyze the limited literature available in secondary PAP due to hematologic malignancies and present a case of PAP associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia successfully treated with bendamustine and rituximab.","['Chaulagain, Chakra P', 'Pilichowska, Monika', 'Brinckerhoff, Laurence', 'Tabba, Maher', 'Erban, John K']","['Chaulagain CP', 'Pilichowska M', 'Brinckerhoff L', 'Tabba M', 'Erban JK']","['Taussig Cancer Institute of Cleveland Clinic, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cleveland Clinic in Weston, FL, USA.

However, the further clinical development of BA got hampered because of poor solubility and pharmacological properties. Interestingly, this molecule offer several hotspots for structural modifications in order to address its associated issues. In our endeavor, we selected C-3 position for the desirable chemical modification in order to improve its cytotoxic and pharmacological potential and prepared a library of different triazoline derivatives of BA. Among them, we previously reported the identification of a potential molecule, that is, 3{1N(5-hydroxy-naphth-1yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4yl}methyloxy betulinic acid (HBA) with significant inhibition of cancer cell growth and their properties. In the present study, we have shown for the first time that HBA decreased the expression of phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) p110alpha and p85alpha and caused significant downregulation of pAKT and of NFkappaB using human leukemia and breast cancer cells as in vitro models. Further it was revealed that PI3K inhibition by HBA induced cell cycle arrest via effects on different cell cycle regulatory proteins that include CDKis cyclins and pGSK3beta. Also, this target-specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by the increased expression of mitochondrial bax, downregulated bcl2 and decreased mitochondrial levels of cytochrome c, together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors such as caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were found to be upregulated besides DNA repair-associated enzyme, that is, PARP cleavage caused cancer cell death. Pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed that both HBA and BA were safe upto the dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight and with acceptable pharmacodynamic parameters. The in vitro data corroborated with in vivo anticancer activity wherein Ehrlich solid tumor showed that HBA as a more potent agent than BA without any body weight loss and mortality.","['Majeed, R', 'Hamid, A', 'Sangwan, P L', 'Chinthakindi, P K', 'Koul, S', 'Rayees, S', 'Singh, G', 'Mondhe, D M', 'Mintoo, M J', 'Singh, S K', 'Rath, S K', 'Saxena, A K']","['Majeed R', 'Hamid A', 'Sangwan PL', 'Chinthakindi PK', 'Koul S', 'Rayees S', 'Singh G', 'Mondhe DM', 'Mintoo MJ', 'Singh SK', 'Rath SK', 'Saxena AK']","['1] Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India [2] Bio-organic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Bio-organic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Bio-organic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Bio-organic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'PK-PD Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'PK-PD Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Bio-organic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141009,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2014/10/10 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014387 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.387 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 9;5:e1459. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.387.,,,PMC4237233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of CLL is highly variable, ranging from a long-lasting indolent disease to an unpredictable and rapidly progressing leukemia requiring treatment. It is thus important to identify novel factors that reflect disease progression or contribute to its assessment. Here, we report on a novel STAT3-mediated pathway that characterizes CLL B cells-extended viability and oxidative stress control. We observed that leukemic but not normal B cells from CLL patients exhibit constitutive activation of an atypical form of the STAT3 signaling factor, phosphorylated on serine 727 (Ser(727)) in the absence of detectable canonical tyrosine 705 (Tyr705)-dependent activation in vivo. The Ser(727)-phosphorylated STAT3 molecule (pSTAT3Ser(727)) is localized to the mitochondria and associates with complex I of the respiratory chain. This pSer(727) modification is further controlled by glutathione-dependent antioxidant pathway(s) that mediate stromal protection of the leukemic B cells and regulate their viability. Importantly, pSTAT3Ser(727), but neither Tyr705-phosphorylated STAT3 nor total STAT3, levels correlate with prolonged in vivo CLL B cells survival. Furthermore, STAT3 activity contributes to the resistance to apoptosis of CLL, but not normal B cells, in vitro. These data reveal that mitochondrial (Mt) pSTAT3Ser(727) overactivity is part of the antioxidant defense pathway of CLL B cells that regulates their viability. Mt pSTAT3Ser(727) appears to be a newly identified cell-protective signal involved in CLL cells survival. Targeting pSTAT3Ser(727) could be a promising new therapeutic approach.","['Capron, C', 'Jondeau, K', 'Casetti, L', 'Jalbert, V', 'Costa, C', 'Verhoeyen, E', 'Masse, J M', 'Coppo, P', 'Bene, M C', 'Bourdoncle, P', 'Cramer-Borde, E', 'Dusanter-Fourt, I']","['Capron C', 'Jondeau K', 'Casetti L', 'Jalbert V', 'Costa C', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Masse JM', 'Coppo P', 'Bene MC', 'Bourdoncle P', 'Cramer-Borde E', 'Dusanter-Fourt I']","[""1] Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris, France [2] Service d'Hematologie-Immunologie, Hopital Ambroise Pare, Boulogne-Billancourt, France [3] Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France [4] CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France [5] Universite de Versailles St Quentin en Yvelines, Guyancourt, France."", ""1] Service d'Hematologie-Immunologie, Hopital Ambroise Pare, Boulogne-Billancourt, France [2] Universite de Versailles St Quentin en Yvelines, Guyancourt, France."", '1] Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris, France [2] Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France [3] CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie-Immunologie, Hopital Ambroise Pare, Boulogne-Billancourt, France."", 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite de Lyon, UCB-Lyon1, Lyon, France.', '1] Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite de Lyon, UCB-Lyon1, Lyon, France [2] INSERM U1065, Lyon, France.', '1] Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris, France [2] Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France [3] CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Saint Antoine and Universite UPMC, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hotel-Dieu-CHU, Nantes, France."", '1] Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris, France [2] Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France [3] CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', ""1] Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris, France [2] Service d'Hematologie-Immunologie, Hopital Ambroise Pare, Boulogne-Billancourt, France [3] Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France [4] CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France [5] Universite de Versailles St Quentin en Yvelines, Guyancourt, France."", '1] Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, Paris, France [2] Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France [3] CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141009,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2014/10/10 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014393 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.393 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 9;5:e1451. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.393.,,,PMC4237234,,"['Cell Death Dis. 2015;6:e1627.

Recently inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins have shown antitumor effects through the suppression of MYC in leukemia and lymphoma. In this paper, we investigated the antitumor activity of a BET protein bromodomain inhibitor (BETi) CPI203 as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin in human PanNETs. We found that exposure of human PanNET cell lines to CPI203 led to downregulation of MYC expression, G1 cell cycle arrest and nearly complete inhibition of cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of MYC suppressed the growth inhibition caused by CPI203 and knockdown of MYC phenocopied the effects of CPI203 treatment. These findings indicate that suppression of MYC contributed to the antiproliferative effects of BETi inhibition in human PanNET cells. Importantly, CPI203 treatment enhanced the antitumor effects of rapamycin in PanNET cells grown in monolayer and in three-dimensional cell cultures, as well as in a human PanNET xenograft model in vivo. Furthermore, the combination treatment attenuated rapamycin-induced AKT activation, a major limitation of rapamycin therapy. Collectively, our data suggest that targeting MYC with a BETi may increase the therapeutic benefits of rapalogs in human PanNET patients. This provides a novel clinical strategy for PanNETs, and possibly for other tumors as well.","['Wong, C', 'Laddha, S V', 'Tang, L', 'Vosburgh, E', 'Levine, A J', 'Normant, E', 'Sandy, P', 'Harris, C

The t(7;21)(p22;q22) rearrangement generating a 5'RUNX1-3'USP42 fusion transcript has been reported in two cases of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and further in eight adult cases of myeloid neoplasms. We describe the first case of adult AML with a 5'RUNX1-3'USP42 fusion gene generated by an insertion event instead of chromosomal translocation. METHODS: Conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses allowed the precise characterization of the chromosomal rearrangement and breakpoints identification. Gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR experiments, whereas bioinformatic studies were carried out for revealing structural genomic characteristics of breakpoint regions. RESULTS: We identified an adult AML case bearing a ins(21;7)(q22;p15p22) generating a 5'RUNX1-3'USP42 fusion gene on der(21) chromosome and causing USP42 gene over-expression. Bioinformatic analysis of the genomic regions involved in ins(21;7)/t(7;21) showed the presence of interchromosomal segmental duplications (SDs) next to the USP42 and RUNX1 genes, that may underlie a non-allelic homologous recombination between chromosome 7 and 21 in AML. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of a 5'RUNX1-3'USP42 chimeric gene generated by a chromosomal cryptic insertion in an adult AML patient. Our data revealed that there may be a pivotal role for SDs in this very rare but recurrent chromosomal rearrangement.","['Zagaria, Antonella', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Tota, Giuseppina', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Cellamare, Angelo', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Minervini, Crescenzio Francesco', 'Brunetti, Claudia', 'Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Zagaria A', 'Anelli L', 'Coccaro N', 'Tota G', 'Casieri P', 'Cellamare A', 'Minervini A', 'Minervini CF', 'Brunetti C', 'Cumbo C', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section - University of Bari, P.zza G.

OBJECTIVE: Here, we demonstrated the apoptotic effects and its related mechanism in MC-3 and YD-15 human MEC cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of CT on apoptotic activity were evaluated by cell proliferation assay, Western blotting, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and luciferase assay. RESULTS: Our data show that CT treatment of MC-3 cells results in anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities in MC-3 and it is accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation and dimerization of signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). CT decreased the expression levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and surviving, whereas Bcl-xL expression was not changed. CT clearly regulates survivin protein at a transcriptional level and alters Mcl-1 through proteasome-dependent protein degradation. In addition, CT-induced apoptotic cell death in YD-15, another human MEC cell line, was associated with the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CT could be a good apoptotic inducer through modification of STAT3 signaling in human MEC cell lines.","['Yu, Hyun-Ju', 'Park, Chul', 'Kim, Sun-Ju', 'Cho, Nam-Pyo', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Yu HJ', 'Park C', 'Kim SJ', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology and Cancer Biology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National Univerisity, Jeonju, 561-756, South Korea.', 'Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National Univerisity, Jeonju, 561-756, South Korea.', 'Department of Dental Hygiene, Division of Health Sciences, Cheongju University, Cheongju, 360-764, South Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology and Cancer Biology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National Univerisity, Jeonju, 561-756, South Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology and Cancer Biology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National Univerisity, Jeonju, 561-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Pharmacogn Mag,Pharmacognosy magazine,101300403,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'cryptotanshinone', 'mucoepidermoid carcinoma', 'myeloid cell leukemia-1', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3', 'survivin']",2014/10/10 06:00,2014/10/10 06:01,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-1296.139802 [doi]', 'PM-10-622 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogn Mag. 2014 Aug;10(Suppl 3):S622-9. doi: 10.4103/0973-1296.139802.,,,PMC4189281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The translocation t(6;12)(q23;13) in a childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line fuses ETV6 with the putative long non-coding RNA gene STL. Linking STL properties to leukemia has so far been difficult. Here, we describe a novel gene, OSTL (annotated as RNF217 in Genbank), which shares the first exon and a CpG island with STL but is transcribed in the opposite direction. Human RNF217 codes for a highly conserved RING finger protein and is mainly expressed in testis and skeletal muscle with different splice variants. RNF217 shows regulated splicing in B cell development, and is expressed in a number of human B cell leukemia cell lines, primary human chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype and acute T-ALL samples. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the anti-apoptotic protein HAX1 to interact with RNF217. This interaction could be mapped to the C-terminal RING finger motif of RNF217. We propose that some of the recurring aberrations involving 6q might deregulate the expression of RNF217 and result in imbalanced apoptosis signalling via HAX1, promoting leukemia development.","['Fontanari Krause, Luciana M', 'Japp, Anna Sophia', 'Krause, Alexandre', 'Mooster, Jana', 'Chopra, Martin', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Bohlander, Stefan K']","['Fontanari Krause LM', 'Japp AS', 'Krause A', 'Mooster J', 'Chopra M', 'Muschen M', 'Bohlander SK']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat, Munich (LMU), Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat, Munich (LMU), Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat, Munich (LMU), Germany.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat, Munich (LMU), Germany [2] Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141009,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (HAX1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNF217 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,,2014/10/10 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['srep06565 [pii]', '10.1038/srep06565 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Oct 9;4:6565. doi: 10.1038/srep06565.,,"['101880/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA137060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4190505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression of Evi1 is observed in 5% to 10% of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and predicts poor prognosis, reflecting multiple leukemogenic properties of Evi1. Here, we show that thrombopoietin (THPO) signaling is implicated in growth and survival of Evi1-expressing cells using a mouse model of Evi1 leukemia. We first identified that the expression of megakaryocytic surface molecules such as ITGA2B (CD41) and the THPO receptor, MPL, positively correlates with EVI1 expression in AML patients. In agreement with this finding, a subpopulation of bone marrow and spleen cells derived from Evi1 leukemia mice expressed both CD41 and Mpl. CD41(+) Evi1 leukemia cells induced secondary leukemia more efficiently than CD41(-) cells in a serial bone marrow transplantation assay. Importantly, the CD41(+) cells predominantly expressing Mpl effectively proliferated and survived on OP9 stromal cells in the presence of THPO via upregulating BCL-xL expression, suggesting an essential role of the THPO/MPL/BCL-xL cascade in enhancing the progression of Evi1 leukemia. These observations provide a novel aspect of the diverse functions of Evi1 in leukemogenesis.","['Nishikawa, Satoshi', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Masamoto, Yosuke', 'Kagoya, Yuki', 'Toya, Takashi', 'Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Nishikawa S', 'Arai S', 'Masamoto Y', 'Kagoya Y', 'Toya T', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Innovative Technology Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Blood Transfusion, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thrombopoietin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2014/10/10 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39611-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-12-546275 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 4;124(24):3587-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-12-546275.

25297989,NLM,MEDLINE,20150119,20151119,1432-0843 (Electronic) 0344-5704 (Linking),74,6,2014 Dec,Clinical usefulness of therapeutic concentration monitoring for imatinib dosage individualization: results from a randomized controlled trial.,1307-19,10.1007/s00280-014-2599-1 [doi],"PURPOSE: This study assessed whether a cycle of ""routine"" therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for imatinib dosage individualization, targeting an imatinib trough plasma concentration (C min) of 1,000 ng/ml (tolerance: 750-1,500 ng/ml), could improve clinical outcomes in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients, compared with TDM use only in case of problems (""rescue"" TDM). METHODS: Imatinib concentration monitoring evaluation was a multicenter randomized controlled trial including adult patients in chronic or accelerated phase CML receiving imatinib since less than 5 years. Patients were allocated 1:1 to ""routine TDM"" or ""rescue TDM."" The primary endpoint was a combined outcome (failure- and toxicity-free survival with continuation on imatinib) over 1-year follow-up, analyzed in intention-to-treat (ISRCTN31181395). RESULTS: Among 56 patients (55 evaluable), 14/27 (52 %) receiving ""routine TDM"" remained event-free versus 16/28 (57 %) ""rescue TDM"" controls (P = 0.69). In the ""routine TDM"" arm, dosage recommendations were correctly adopted in 14 patients (median C min: 895 ng/ml), who had fewer unfavorable events (28 %) than the 13 not receiving the advised dosage (77 %; P = 0.03; median C min: 648 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: This first target concentration intervention trial could not formally demonstrate a benefit of ""routine TDM"" because of small patient number and surprisingly limited prescriber's adherence to dosage recommendations. Favorable outcomes were, however, found in patients actually elected for target dosing. This study thus shows first prospective indication for TDM being a useful tool to guide drug dosage and shift decisions. The study design and analysis provide an interesting paradigm for future randomized TDM trials on targeted anticancer agents.","['Gotta, V', 'Widmer, N', 'Decosterd, L A', 'Chalandon, Y', 'Heim, D', 'Gregor, M', 'Benz, R', 'Leoncini-Franscini, L', 'Baerlocher, G M', 'Duchosal, M A', 'Csajka, C', 'Buclin, T']","['Gotta V', 'Widmer N', 'Decosterd LA', 'Chalandon Y', 'Heim D', 'Gregor M', 'Benz R', 'Leoncini-Franscini L', 'Baerlocher GM', 'Duchosal MA', 'Csajka C', 'Buclin T']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Service of Biomedicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), University of Lausanne, Bugnon 17-1, 1011, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141009,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/10/10 06:00,2015/01/20 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2599-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Dec;74(6):1307-19. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2599-1.

One of the omic technologies widely used in many studies on human samples are the exon-specific expression microarray platforms. RESULTS: Since there are not many validated comparative analyses to identify specific splicing events using data derived from these types of platforms, we have developed an algorithm (called ESLiM) to detect significant changes in exon use, and applied it to a reference dataset of 270 human genes that show alternative expression in different tissues. We compared the results with three other methodological approaches and provided the R source code to be applied elsewhere. The genes positively detected by these analyses also provide a verified subset of human genes that present tissue-regulated isoforms. Furthermore, we performed a validation analysis on human patient samples comparing two different subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and we experimentally validated the splicing in several selected genes that showed exons with highly significant signal change. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analyses with other methods using a fair set of human genes that show alternative splicing and the validation on clinical samples demonstrate that the proposed novel algorithm is a reliable tool for detecting differential splicing in exon-level expression data.","['Risueno, Alberto', 'Roson-Burgo, Beatriz', 'Dolnik, Anna', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'De Las Rivas, Javier']","['Risueno A', 'Roson-Burgo B', 'Dolnik A', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Bullinger L', 'De Las Rivas J']","['Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics Research Group, Cancer Research Center (CiC-IBMCC, CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. jrivas@usal.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,['0 (Protein Isoforms)'],IM,"['Algorithms', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Organ Specificity', 'Protein Isoforms/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,2014/10/10 06:00,2015/07/07 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-15-879 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-15-879 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2014 Oct 8;15:879. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-879.,,,PMC4298068,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Torin-2 is a novel, second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitor that is potent and selective for mTOR with a superior pharmacokinetic profile to previous inhibitors. It has been shown that Torin-2 displayed dramatic antiproliferative activity across a panel of cancer cell lines. To investigate if Torin-2 could represent a new option for the treatment of B-pre ALL, we tested its activity on a panel of B-pre ALL cell lines. In all of them Torin-2 showed a powerful cytotoxic activity, inhibiting the growth of each cell line in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(5)(0) in the nanomolar range. Torin-2 caused both apoptosis and autophagy, induced cell cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1) phase and affected both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities as assessed by their specific substrate dephosphorylation. Torin-2 alone suppressed feedback activation of PI3K/Akt, whereas the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 required the addition of the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 to achieve the same effect. These pharmacological strategies targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR at different points of the signaling pathway cascade might represent a new promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of B-pre ALL patients.","['Simioni, Carolina', 'Cani, Alice', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'McCubrey, James', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Simioni C', 'Cani A', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Tabellini G', 'McCubrey J', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.

In multiple myeloma, survivin has been described to be involved in downstream sequelae of various therapeutic agents. We assessed 1093 samples from previously untreated patients, including two independent cohorts of 392 and 701 patients, respectively. Survivin expression was associated with cell proliferation, adverse prognostic markers, and inferior event-free and overall survival, supporting the evaluation of survivin as a therapeutic target in myeloma. The small molecule suppressant of survivin--YM155--is in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. YM155 potently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in primary myeloma cells and cell lines. Gene expression and protein profiling revealed the critical roles of IL6/STAT3-signaling and the unfolded protein response in the efficacy of YM155. Both pathways converged to down regulate anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 in myeloma cells. Conversely, growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death by YM155 was rescued by ectopic expression of Mcl-1 but not survivin, identifying Mcl-1 as the pivotal downstream target of YM155 in multiple myeloma. Mcl-1 expression was likewise associated with adverse prognostic markers, and inferior survival.

Here we review the current indications of SCT in this disease. While patients with favorable cytogenetics should receive consolidation chemotherapy, patients with unfavorable karyotype are prime candidates for SCT or new approaches to SCT (which should be done in first complete remission). Patients with intermediate prognoses should also receive SCT in first complete remission. In the absence of a suitable matched related donor, most patients will be able to find an alternative donor to proceed to a potentially curative allogeneic transplantation. The use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens before SCT has allowed patients in the sixth or seventh decades of life to be routinely transplanted. Despite major differences among transplant centers in the intensity and composition of the conditioning regimen and immunosuppression, choice of graft source, postgraft immune-modulation, and supportive care, there has been a dramatic improvement in terms of tolerance. Although it is presumed to be a curative strategy, major complications of SCT remain graft-versus-host disease, delayed immune recovery, multiple comorbidities, and relapse after transplant.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"[""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon-Sud, service d'hematologie clinique, Pavillon Marcel Berard, Bat. 1 G, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495 Pierre Benite cedex, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,IM,"['Adult', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/methods', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'myeloablative conditioning', 'reduced intensity conditioning']",2014/10/09 06:00,2015/04/02 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['bdc.2014.1944 [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2014.1944 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2014 Sep;101(9):856-65. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2014.1944.,,,,,,,,,,,,Indications actuelles de l'allogreffe de cellules souches hematopoietiques dans le traitement de la leucemie aigue myeloide de l'adulte.,,,,,,

On the other hand, the danger model of immunity suggests that transplant-associated recipient tissue injury rather than donor-derived alloreactive T cells is the main cause of GVHD. What has been less appreciated are the early, both conditioning-dependent and conditioning-independent, events that impair homeostatic cellular adaptations and host-protective immune responses leading to the development of tissue-specific GVHD. The notion of gut injury precipitating in GVHD has been acknowledged by clinicians, with the shift to reduced intensity-conditioning regimens that prevent acute tissue injury and are less disruptive of tissue adaptation to T cell attack. Also, the role of host-protective immune response against pathogens in preventing GVHD has been shown by the lack of severe GVHD in germ free mice as well as an impaired anti-viral immune response during chronic GVHD. This article provides a brief review of the literature on GVHD and suggests that transplant-induced dysregulation of the protective immune response in the recipient of SCT is more important than allogeneic T cells in causing GVHD.","['Manjili, Masoud H', 'Toor, Amir A']","['Manjili MH', 'Toor AA']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine , Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA , USA .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological/immunology', 'Animals', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Alloreactivity', 'T lymphocytes', 'graft versus host disease', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia']",2014/10/09 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08820139.2014.953636 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2014;43(8):851-7. doi: 10.3109/08820139.2014.953636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we developed transgenic mice that constitutively express human PELI1 and determined that these mice have a shorter lifespan due to tumor formation. Constitutive expression of PELI1 resulted in ligand-independent hyperactivation of B cells and facilitated the development of a wide range of lymphoid tumors, with prominent B cell infiltration observed across multiple organs. PELI1 directly interacted with the oncoprotein B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCL6) and induced lysine 63-mediated BCL6 polyubiquitination. In samples from patients with diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), PELI1 expression levels positively correlated with BCL6 expression, and PELI1 overexpression was closely associated with poor prognosis in DLBCLs. Together, these results suggest that increased PELI1 expression and subsequent induction of BCL6 promotes lymphomagenesis and that this pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic strategies to treat B cell lymphomas.","['Park, Hye-Young', 'Go, Heounjeong', 'Song, Ha Rim', 'Kim, Suhyeon', 'Ha, Geun-Hyoung', 'Jeon, Yoon-Kyung', 'Kim, Ji-Eun', 'Lee, Ho', 'Cho, Hyeseong', 'Kang, Ho Chul', 'Chung, Hee-Young', 'Kim, Chul-Woo', 'Chung, Doo Hyun', 'Lee, Chang-Woo']","['Park HY', 'Go H', 'Song HR', 'Kim S', 'Ha GH', 'Jeon YK', 'Kim JE', 'Lee H', 'Cho H', 'Kang HC', 'Chung HY', 'Kim CW', 'Chung DH', 'Lee CW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (PELI1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphangiogenesis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/mortality', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Polyubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'ROC Curve', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*physiology', '*Ubiquitination']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/03/03 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['75667 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI75667 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Nov;124(11):4976-88. doi: 10.1172/JCI75667.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of a self-inactivating retrovirus for the treatment of SCID-X1. METHODS: We enrolled nine boys with SCID-X1 in parallel trials in Europe and the United States to evaluate treatment with a self-inactivating (SIN) gamma-retrovirus vector containing deletions in viral enhancer sequences expressing gammac (SIN-gammac). RESULTS: All patients received bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells transduced with the SIN-gammac vector, without preparative conditioning. After 12.1 to 38.7 months of follow-up, eight of the nine children were still alive. One patient died from an overwhelming adenoviral infection before reconstitution with genetically modified T cells. Of the remaining eight patients, seven had recovery of peripheral-blood T cells that were functional and led to resolution of infections. The patients remained healthy thereafter. The kinetics of CD3+ T-cell recovery was not significantly different from that observed in previous trials. Assessment of insertion sites in peripheral blood from patients in the current trial as compared with those in previous trials revealed significantly less clustering of insertion sites within LMO2, MECOM, and other lymphoid proto-oncogenes in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: This modified gamma-retrovirus vector was found to retain efficacy in the treatment of SCID-X1. The long-term effect of this therapy on leukemogenesis remains unknown.

Herein, we investigated whether this could be due to cross-reactive antibodies to two homologous peptides in the Gag protein of the endogenous retrovirus HTLV-related endogenous sequence-1 (HRES-1). In addition, we had previously shown that patients with HTLV neurodegenerative diseases had increased seroreactivity to homologous HERV-K10 endogenous retrovirus peptides. Hence, in this study we also examined whether these patients had increased seroreactivity to the aforementioned HRES-1 Gag peptides. Sera from 100 volunteer blood donors (VBD), 53 patients with LGLL, 74 subjects with HTLV-1 or 2 infection (58 nonmyelopathy and 16 myelopathy), and 83 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were evaluated. The HTLV-positive myelopathy (HAM) patients had a statistically increased prevalence of antibodies to both HRES-1 Gag peptides (81%) vs. the VBD (0%), LGLL patients (13%), and MS patients (1%), and the HTLV-positive nonmyelopathy subjects (21%). The data suggest that cross-reactivity to HRES-1 peptides could be involved in the pathogenesis of HAM. The difference between the VBD and LGLL patients was also statistically significant, also suggesting a possible association in a minority of patients.","['Perzova, Raisa', 'Graziano, Elliot', 'Sanghi, Swathi', 'Welch, Caitlin', 'Benz, Patricia', 'Abbott, Lynn', 'Lalone, Danielle', 'Glaser, Jordan', 'Loughran, Thomas', 'Sheremata, William', 'Poiesz, Bernard J']","['Perzova R', 'Graziano E', 'Sanghi S', 'Welch C', 'Benz P', 'Abbott L', 'Lalone D', 'Glaser J', 'Loughran T', 'Sheremata W', 'Poiesz BJ']","['1 Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, State University of New York, Upstate Medical University , Syracuse, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141119,United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Blood Donors', 'Cross Reactions', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/AID.2014.0171 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2015 Feb;31(2):242-9. doi: 10.1089/AID.2014.0171.

Three subcategories have been identified according to the immunophenotypic features: CLL-like, CD5(+) atypical, and CD5(-) MBL. CLL-like MBL is by far the most frequent and best studied category and further divided in low-count [LC] and high-count [HC] MBL, based on a cutoff value of 500/muL clonal B cells. LC-MBL typically remains stable and probably does not represent a truly premalignant condition, but rather an age-related immune senescence. On the other hand, HC-MBL is closely related to CLL-Rai0, bearing similar immunogenetic profile, and is associated with an annual risk of progression to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of 1.1%. Currently there are no reproducible factors for evaluating the risk of progression to CLL. CD5(-) MBL is characterized by an immunophenotype consistent with marginal zone origin and displays many similarities with marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), mainly the splenic MZL.

Patients with del(5q) MDS share biological features that account for the profound hypoplastic anemia and unique sensitivity to treatment with lenalidomide. Ineffective erythropoiesis in del(5q) MDS arises from allelic deletion of the ribosomal processing S-14 (RPS14) gene, which leads to MDM2 sequestration with consequent p53 activation and erythroid cell death. Since its approval in 2005, lenalidomide has changed the natural course of the disease. Patients who achieve transfusion independence and/or a cytogenetic response with lenalidomide have a decreased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia and an improved overall survival compared to non-responders. Elucidation of the mechanisms of action of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS has advanced therapeutic strategies for this disease. The selective cytotoxicity of lenalidomide in del(5q) clones derives from inhibition of a haplodeficient phosphatase whose catalytic domain is encoded within the common deleted region on chromosome 5q, i.e., protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Acalpha). PP2A is a highly conserved, dual specificity phosphatase that plays an essential role in regulation of the G2/M checkpoint. Inhibition of PP2Acalpha results in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in del(5q) cells. Targeted knockdown of PP2Acalpha using siRNA is sufficient to sensitize non-del(5q) clones to lenalidomide. Through its inhibitory effect on PP2A, lenalidomide stabilizes MDM2 to restore p53 degradation in erythroid precursors, with subsequent arrest in G2/M. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with del(5q) MDS develop resistance to lenalidomide over time associated with PP2Acalpha over-expression. Targeted inhibition of PP2A with a more potent inhibitor has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach for patients with del(5q) MDS.","['Sallman, David A', 'Wei, Sheng', 'List, Alan']","['Sallman DA', 'Wei S', 'List A']","['Immunology Program and Malignant Hematology Program, H.

Intensification of chemotherapy regimens for those at highest risk has improved success rates, but at the cost of significantly increased morbidity and long-term adverse effects. With the success of imatinib in Philadelphia-chromosome-positive leukemia and all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the quest to find additional molecularly targeted therapies has generated much excitement over recent years. Another such possible target in pediatric acute leukemia is FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). FLT3 aberrations are among the most frequently identified transforming events in AML, and have significant clinical implications in both high-risk pediatric AML and in certain high-risk groups of pediatric ALL. Therefore, the successful targeting of FLT3 has tremendous potential to improve outcomes in these subsets of patients. This article will give an overview of the molecular function and signaling of the FLT3 receptor, as well as its pathogenic role in leukemia. We review the discovery of targeting FLT3, discuss currently available FLT3 inhibitors in pediatric leukemia and results of clinical trials to date, and finally, consider the future promise and challenges of FLT3 inhibitor therapy.","['Annesley, Colleen E', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Annesley CE', 'Brown P']","['Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD , USA.', 'Oncology and Pediatrics, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140923,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'MLL', 'MLLr', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2014/10/09 06:00,2014/10/09 06:01,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00263 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 Sep 23;4:263. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00263. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4172015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexity of CLL with respect to different chromosomal aberrations, lack of a common aberrant signaling pathway activation, and associated immune suppression of the disease has been seen a major stumbling block for developing a single targeted therapy similar to imatinib used in chronic myeloid leukemia. The upcoming therapeutic era we are entering with the B-cell receptor (BCR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib appears to be overcoming this obstacle. Indeed, for the large majority of patients, it appears that application of BCR kinase inhibitors can promote durable remissions without the need for chemotherapy. Where other very active targeted agents such as ABT-199, therapeutic antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells will be used in CLL also represents a major question that future clinical trials will answer.","['Awan, Farrukh T', 'Byrd, John C']","['Awan FT', 'Byrd JC']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio. farrukh.awan@osumc.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141007,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-1889 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1889 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Dec 1;20(23):5869-74. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1889.

Here we report that in human AML ibrutinib, in addition, functions to inhibit SDF1/CXCR4-mediated AML migration at concentrations achievable in vivo. It has previously been shown that SDF1/CXCR4-induced migration is dependent on activation of downstream BTK in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma. Here we show that SDF-1 induces BTK phosphorylation and downstream MAPK signalling in primary AML blast. Furthermore, we show that ibrutinib can inhibit SDF1-induced AKT and MAPK activation. These results reported here provide a molecular mechanistic rationale for clinically evaluating BTK inhibition in AML patients and suggests that in some AML patients the blasts count may initially rise in response to ibrutinib therapy, analgous to similar clinical observations in CLL.","['Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Murray, Megan Y', 'Shafat, Manar S', 'Lawes, Matthew J', 'MacEwan, David J', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A']","['Zaitseva L', 'Murray MY', 'Shafat MS', 'Lawes MJ', 'MacEwan DJ', 'Bowles KM', 'Rushworth SA']","['Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Colney Lane, Norwich United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom.

We sought to explore hematologic oncologists' perspectives and decision-making processes regarding end-of-life (EOL) care. METHODS: Between September 2013 and January 2014, 20 hematologic oncologists from the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center participated in four focus groups regarding EOL care for leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Focus groups employed a semistructured format with case vignettes and open-ended questions and were followed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Many participants felt that identifying the EOL phase for patients with hematologic cancers was challenging as a result of the continuing potential for cure with advanced disease and the often rapid pace of decline near death. This difficulty was reported to result in later initiation of EOL care. Barriers to high-quality EOL care were also reported to be multifactorial, including unrealistic expectations from both physicians and patients, long-term patient-physician relationships resulting in difficulty conducting EOL discussions, and inadequacy of existing home-based EOL services. Participants also expressed concern that some EOL quality measures developed for solid tumors may be unacceptable for patients with blood cancers given their unique needs at the EOL (eg, palliative transfusions). CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that hematologic oncologists need better clinical markers for when to initiate EOL care. In addition, current quality measures may be inappropriate for identifying overly aggressive care for patients with blood cancers. Further research is needed to develop effective interventions to improve EOL care for this patient population.","['Odejide, Oreofe O', 'Salas Coronado, Diana Y', 'Watts, Corey D', 'Wright, Alexi A', 'Abel, Gregory A']","['Odejide OO', 'Salas Coronado DY', 'Watts CD', 'Wright AA', 'Abel GA']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA Gregory_abel@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141007,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hospice Care', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medical Oncology', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Transfer', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Quality of Health Care', '*Terminal Care']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JOP.2014.001537 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2014.001537 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2014 Nov;10(6):e396-403. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2014.001537.

The 41 EMT specimens were from 28 patients, with 11 having more than 1 consecutive EMT in different anatomic locations at different times post-HSCT. The median age at EMT diagnosis was 45 years (range, 17-73 years), and the male/female ratio was 17:11. The most common initial diagnosis was acute myeloid leukemia (21), followed by chronic myeloid leukemia with myeloid blast phase (2), primary myelofibrosis with acute leukemic transformation (1), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2), mixed lineage T/myeloid leukemia (1), and plasma cell myeloma (1). All initial presentations were limited to bone marrow-only disease. Twenty patients had abnormal chromosomal karyotypes, whereas 6 had normal cytogenetics with their original disease. All patients received standard chemotherapy followed by allogeneic (27) or autologous (1) HSCT. The EMTs occurred 2 to 177 months (median, 16.5 months) after HSCT and were diagnosed as solid mass lesions as follows: skin and soft tissue (10), central nervous system and paraspinal tissue (9), breast (7), gastrointestinal tract (4), lymph node (4), genitourinary system (4), and mediastinum (3). Interestingly, all but 3 patients had negative bone marrows at the time their EMT was diagnosed, indicating that most EMTs presented as sole lesion of relapsed disease. The overall outcome was dismal for patients with EMT, with 20 (71%) of 28 patients deceased at 1 to 26 months after EMT diagnosis, with a median overall survival of only 6.5 months.","['Huang, Qin', 'Reddi, Deepti', 'Chu, Peiguo', 'Snyder, David S', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D']","['Huang Q', 'Reddi D', 'Chu P', 'Snyder DS', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical, Los Angeles, CA 90048.

One new daucane (DE-20) and one new phenol derivative (PH-3) were isolated and characterized in addition to six daucane, three coumarins and four simple phenolics. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated against a panel of six human tumor cell lines. The derivative DE-17 that resulted moderately active on all the studied cell lines was studied to evaluate its possible mechanism of action. DE-17 was able to induce apoptosis in a time and concentration-dependent manner in SEM and Jurkat cell lines. We observed that DE-17 just after 1h of treatment increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and that the co-incubation of DE-17 with ROS scavengers significantly increased cell viability suggesting that ROS-mediated downstream signaling is essential for the antiproliferative effects of DE-17. At later times of incubation DE-17 induced mitochondrial depolarization, as well as caspase-3 and -9 activation suggesting that apoptosis follow the mitochondrial pathway. Concomitantly to ROS induction, a remarkable decrease of mRNA expression of several antioxidant enzymes and intracellular GSH content was detected in treated cells compared to controls further indicative of oxidative stress. Taken together our results showed for the first time that daucane esters induces apoptotic cell death through a ROS-mediated mechanism in human leukemia cells.","[""Dall'Acqua, Stefano"", 'Linardi, Maria Antonella', 'Bortolozzi, Roberta', 'Clauser, Maria', 'Marzocchini, Sara', 'Maggi, Filippo', 'Nicoletti, Marcello', 'Innocenti, Gabbriella', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Viola, Giampietro']","[""Dall'Acqua S"", 'Linardi MA', 'Bortolozzi R', 'Clauser M', 'Marzocchini S', 'Maggi F', 'Nicoletti M', 'Innocenti G', 'Basso G', 'Viola G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze del Farmaco, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.

Here, we show that the phosphatase SCP1 and its isoforms SCP2/3 dephosphorylate PML at S518, thereby blocking PML ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the prolyl isomerase Pin1 and the ubiquitin ligase KLHL20. Clinically, SCP1 and SCP3 are downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and these events correlated with PMLS518 phosphorylation, PML turnover, and high-grade tumors. Restoring SCP1-mediated PML stabilization not only inhibited malignant features of ccRCC, including proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor growth, and tumor angiogenesis, but also suppressed the mTOR-HIF pathway. Furthermore, blocking PML degradation in ccRCC by SCP1 overexpression or Pin1 inhibition enhanced the tumor-suppressive effects of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. Taken together, our results define a novel pathway of PML degradation in ccRCC that involves SCP downregulation, revealing contributions of this pathway to ccRCC progression and offering a mechanistic rationale for combination therapies that jointly target PML degradation and mTOR inhibition for ccRCC treatment.","['Lin, Yu-Ching', 'Lu, Li-Ting', 'Chen, Hsin-Yi', 'Duan, Xueyan', 'Lin, Xia', 'Feng, Xin-Hua', 'Tang, Ming-Jer', 'Chen, Ruey-Hwa']","['Lin YC', 'Lu LT', 'Chen HY', 'Duan X', 'Lin X', 'Feng XH', 'Tang MJ', 'Chen RH']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

Previously, mtDNA CN was associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). We conducted a replication study in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study and pooled with published ATBC (Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene) data. METHODS: In PLCO, 292 NHL cases (95 CLL/SLL cases) and 301 controls were pooled with 142 NHL cases (47 CLL/SLL cases) and 142 controls from ATBC. Subjects answered a questionnaire and provided blood. DNA was extracted from prediagnostic peripheral white blood, and mtDNA CN assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Unconditional logistic regression estimated mtDNA CN and NHL risk by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Greater mtDNA CN was associated with increased risk of CLL/SLL among males in PLCO (3rd vs. 1st tertile: OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.03-4.72; Ptrend: 0.049) and pooled (T3 vs. T1: OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.72-5.68; Ptrend: 0.0002). Association was stronger among male smokers (Ptrend: <0.0001) and essentially identical for cases diagnosed <6, >6-8, and >8 years from blood draw (pooled: Pinteraction: 0.65). mtDNA CN and risk of other NHL subtypes and multiple myeloma showed no association. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACT: Mitochondrial DNA CN was associated with risk of CLL/SLL in males/male smokers. The risk was observed among cases diagnosed as long as 8 years after blood draw.

The experimental design comprised leukemic cells or xenografts of P39 cells, treated in vitro or in vivo, respectively, with quercetin; apoptosis, cell-cycle and autophagy activation were then evaluated. Quercetin caused pronounced apoptosis in P39 leukemia cells, followed by Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 downregulation, Bax upregulation, and mitochondrial translocation, triggering cytochrome c release and caspases activation. Quercetin also induced the expression of FasL protein. Furthermore, our results demonstrated an antioxidant activity of quercetin. Quercetin treatment resulted in an increased cell arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle, with pronounced decrease in CDK2, CDK6, cyclin D, cyclin E, and cyclin A proteins, decreased Rb phosphorylation and increased p21 and p27 expression. Quercetin induced autophagosome formation in the P39 cell line. Autophagy inhibition induced by quercetin with chloroquine triggered apoptosis but did not alter quercetin modulation in the G1 phase. P39 cell treatment with a combination of quercetin and selective inhibitors of ERK1/2 and/or JNK (PD184352 or SP600125, respectively), significantly decreased cells in G1 phase, this treatment, however, did not change the apoptotic cell number. Furthermore, in vivo administration of quercetin significantly reduced tumor volume in P39 xenografts and confirmed in vitro results regarding apoptosis, autophagy, and cell-cycle arrest. The antitumor activity of quercetin both in vitro and in vivo revealed in this study, point to quercetin as an attractive antitumor agent for hematologic malignancies.","['Maso, Victor', 'Calgarotto, Andrana Karla', 'Franchi, Gilberto Carlos Jr', 'Nowill, Alexandre Eduardo', 'Filho, Paulo Latuf', 'Vassallo, Jose', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla']","['Maso V', 'Calgarotto AK', 'Franchi GC Jr', 'Nowill AE', 'Filho PL', 'Vassallo J', 'Saad ST']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Onco-Hematological Child Research Center, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas-Unicamp, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Onco-Hematological Child Research Center, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas-Unicamp, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Laboratory of Investigative and Molecular Pathology, CIPED, FCM-Unicamp, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Laboratory of Investigative and Molecular Pathology, CIPED, FCM-Unicamp, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. sara@unicamp.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141007,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-13-0383 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0383 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2014 Dec;7(12):1240-50. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0383.

To understand how these antagonistic activities influence oncogenesis, we dissected the nuclear and cytoplasmic functions of p27 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a well-characterized malignancy caused by the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. p27 is predominantly cytoplasmic in CML and nuclear in normal cells. BCR-ABL1 regulates nuclear and cytoplasmic p27 abundance by kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. p27 knockdown in CML cell lines with predominantly cytoplasmic p27 induces apoptosis, consistent with a leukemogenic role of cytoplasmic p27. Accordingly, a p27 mutant (p27(CK-)) devoid of Cdk inhibitory nuclear functions enhances leukemogenesis in a murine CML model compared with complete absence of p27. In contrast, p27 mutations that enhance its stability (p27(T187A)) or nuclear retention (p27(S10A)) attenuate leukemogenesis over wild-type p27, validating the tumor-suppressor function of nuclear p27 in CML. We conclude that BCR-ABL1 kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms convert p27 from a nuclear tumor suppressor to a cytoplasmic oncogene. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27 despite BCR-ABL1 inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibitors may contribute to drug resistance, and effective therapeutic strategies to stabilize nuclear p27 must also prevent cytoplasmic mislocalization.","['Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Mackenzie, Ryan J', 'Besson, Arnaud', 'Jeng, Sophia', 'Carey, Alyssa', 'LaTocha, Dorian H', 'Fleischman, Angela G', 'Duquesnes, Nicolas', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Vasudevan, Kavin B', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Firpo, Eduardo', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'McWeeney, Shannon', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Roberts, James M', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Agarwal A', 'Mackenzie RJ', 'Besson A', 'Jeng S', 'Carey A', 'LaTocha DH', 'Fleischman AG', 'Duquesnes N', 'Eide CA', 'Vasudevan KB', 'Loriaux MM', 'Firpo E', 'Cortes JE', 'McWeeney S', ""O'Hare T"", 'Roberts JM', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France;', 'Division of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France;', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR;', 'Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Division of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies and Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies and Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141007,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/02/25 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35386-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-04-497040 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 20;124(22):3260-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-04-497040.

Targeted inhibition of beta-catenin signaling has been hampered by the lack of pathway components amenable to pharmacologic manipulation. Here we identified a novel beta-catenin regulator, GPR84, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family that represents a highly tractable class of drug targets. High GPR84 expression levels were confirmed in human and mouse AML LSCs compared with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Suppression of GPR84 significantly inhibited cell growth by inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest in pre-LSCs, reduced LSC frequency, and impaired reconstitution of stem cell-derived mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) AML, which represents an aggressive and drug-resistant subtype of AML. The GPR84-deficient phenotype in established AML could be rescued by expression of constitutively active beta-catenin. Furthermore, GPR84 conferred a growth advantage to Hoxa9/Meis1a-transduced stem cells. Microarray analysis demonstrated that GPR84 significantly upregulated a small set of MLL-fusion targets and beta-catenin coeffectors, and downregulated a hematopoietic cell-cycle inhibitor. Altogether, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role of GPR84 in maintaining fully developed AML by sustaining aberrant beta-catenin signaling in LSCs, and suggest that targeting the oncogenic GPR84/beta-catenin signaling axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Dietrich, Philipp A', 'Yang, Chen', 'Leung, Halina H L', 'Lynch, Jennifer R', 'Gonzales, Estrella', 'Liu, Bing', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Wang, Jianlong', 'Wang, Jenny Yingzi']","['Dietrich PA', 'Yang C', 'Leung HH', 'Lynch JR', 'Gonzales E', 'Liu B', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Wang J', 'Wang JY']","[""Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Kids Cancer Alliance, Translational Cancer Research Centre for Kids, Cancer Institute New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia;"", 'Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', ""Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; School of Women's and Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141007,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GPR84 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'beta Catenin/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/02/25 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35388-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-532523 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 20;124(22):3284-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-532523.

Signaling via conjugation of surface receptors within the tumor environmental niche activates survival and proliferation pathways in CLL. Of these, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway appears to be pivotal to support CLL pathogenesis, and pharmacologic inhibitors targeting this axis have shown clinical activity. Here we investigate OSU-T315, a compound that disrupts the PI3K/AKT pathway in a novel manner. Dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity by OSU-T315 is noted in both CLL-derived cell lines and primary CLL cells relative to normal lymphocytes. In contrast to the highly successful Bruton's tyrosine kinase and PI3K inhibitors that inhibit B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway at proximal kinases, OSU-T315 directly abrogates AKT activation by preventing translocation of AKT into lipid rafts without altering the activation of receptor-associated kinases. Through this mechanism, the agent triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in CLL by suppressing BCR, CD49d, CD40, and Toll-like receptor 9-mediated AKT activation in an integrin-linked kinase-independent manner. In vivo, OSU-T315 attains pharmacologically active drug levels and significantly prolongs survival in the TCL1 mouse model.

The aim was to determine if serum thymidine kinase 1 (sTK1) activity and sTK1 protein levels in dogs with mammary tumors could be useful in veterinary medicine. RESULTS: Serum samples from 20 healthy dogs and 27 dogs with mammary tumors were analyzed for sTK1 activity, using an [(3)H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation assay, and for sTK1 protein levels by immune affinity/Western blot assay. The molecular forms of sTK1 in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), canine mammary tumor (CMT), and healthy sera were determined by size exclusion chromatography. Mean sTK1 activities in CMT were 1.0 +/- 0.36 pmol/min/mL, differing significantly from healthy dogs (mean +/- SD = 0.73 +/- 0.26 pmol/min/mL). Serum TK1 protein (26 kDa polypeptide) levels were also significantly higher in CMTs compared to healthy dogs (mean +/- SD = 28.5 +/- 11.4, and 8.5 +/- 4 ng/mL, respectively). Cellular TK1 isolated from ALL tumor cells was predominantly a dimer, while the serum TK1 activity eluted as a high molecular weight (MW) oligomer. In analyses of CMT tissue extracts, TK1 activity eluted in two peaks, a minor peak with a high MW oligomer and a major tetramer peak. Western blot analysis of chromatographic fractions showed that cellular TK1 protein in both ALL and CMT dogs, and to some extent serum TK1 from ALL dogs, correlated with activity profiles, but a large fraction of inactive TK1 protein was detected in CMT. CONCLUSIONS: Serum TK1 protein and activity levels were significantly higher in CMT than in healthy dogs. Size exclusion chromatography demonstrated major differences in the molecular forms of sTK1 in ALL, healthy, and CMT dogs, with a large fraction of inactive TK1 protein in CMT. Our results showed that the sTK1 protein assay can differentiate benign tumors (early stage tumors) from healthy more efficiently than sTK1 activity assay. This preliminary data supports that sTK1 protein assay is clinically useful. Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic or prognostic role of serum TK1 protein in CMTs.","['Jagarlamudi, Kiran Kumar', 'Westberg, Sara', 'Ronnberg, Henrik', 'Eriksson, Staffan']","['Jagarlamudi KK', 'Westberg S', 'Ronnberg H', 'Eriksson S']","['Center of Clinical Comparative Oncology (C3O), Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, S-750 07, Sweden. henrik.von.euler@slu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (thymidine kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Dog Diseases/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Thymidine Kinase/blood/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s12917-014-0228-1 [pii]', '10.1186/s12917-014-0228-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2014 Oct 8;10:228. doi: 10.1186/s12917-014-0228-1.,,,PMC4195903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen of 50 patients had high serum copper level; they had a significant increase in LDH, serum beta(2)M, incidence of positive Coombs' test, CD38 and ZAP-70, incidence of 17p del, and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte doubling time and time to start treatment with a lower treatment response rate. No significant difference was found with regard to Rai staging for CLL. These results indicate that serum copper level, a cheap and simple laboratory test, is of great value in CLL patients as it showed a significant association with some important adverse prognostic markers such as increased expression of ZAP-70 and CD38, shorter time to start treatment and poor response to treatment.","['Labib, Hany A', 'Hassanein, Mona', 'Etewa, Rasha L']","['Labib HA', 'Hassanein M', 'Etewa RL']","['Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141008,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Copper/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1686-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Dec;100(6):575-81. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1686-8.

Our study showed that low-toxicity Embelin enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis through DR4 and DR5 upregulation and caspase activation in HL-60 cells. Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibited cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL alone or combined with low-toxicity Embelin, which indicated the cytotoxic effect is mediated by caspase-dependent apoptosis. Although Embelin is an X chromosome-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (XIAP) inhibitor, an XIAP independent effect on cell death was detected in HL-60 cells exposed to low-toxicity Embelin and TRAIL. Low-toxicity Embelin upregulated DR4 and DR5 expression to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The sensitizing effects of Embelin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis were markedly attenuated when DR4/DR5 was knocked down. These data suggested that low-toxicity Embelin enhanced TRAIL-induced cell apoptosis through DR4 and DR5 upregulation, indicating that combination of low-toxicity Embelin and TRAIL may become as a potential antileukemia strategy.","['Hu, Rong', 'Yang, Ying', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Jiang, Huinan', 'Zhu, Ke', 'Li, Jia', 'Xu, Wenhui']","['Hu R', 'Yang Y', 'Liu Z', 'Jiang H', 'Zhu K', 'Li J', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110004, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141008,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SHC6U8F5ER (embelin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*administration & dosage', 'Caspases/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2702-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Feb;36(2):769-77. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2702-6.

IFI risk factors were analyzed using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. In total, 4,192 patients receiving 4,889 chemotherapy courses were enrolled [mean age 40.7 years, 58.4% male, 16.9% children (<18 years)]. The most common hematological diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 28.5%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 26.3%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 20.2%). Severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/mm(3)) occurred after one third (1,633/4,889, 33.4%) of chemotherapy courses. Incidence of proven/probable IFI was 2.1% per chemotherapy course and higher in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 4.94%), acute hyperleukocytic leukemia (AHL, 4.76%), AML (3.83%), or induction chemotherapy. Risk factors included ANC <500/mm(3) [odds ratio (OR) 3.60], AML or MDS (OR 1.97), induction chemotherapy (OR 2.58), previous IFI (OR 3.08), and being male (OR 1.74). Antifungal agents, prescribed in one quarter (1,211/4,889, 24.8%) of chemotherapy courses, included primary/secondary prophylaxis (n = 827, 16.9%) and/or treatment (n = 655, 13.4%; 86.9 % triazoles), which was empirical (84.3%), pre-emptive (8.6%), or targeted (7.1%). Overall mortality following each chemotherapy course (1.5%) increased in proven/probable (11.7%) and possible IFI (8.2%). In summary, IFI was more common in MDS, AHL, AML, or induction chemotherapy, and substantially increased mortality. Neutropenic patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML or MDS and those with previous IFI were at particular risk. Antifungal prophylaxis showed an independent protective effect but was not commonly used, even in high-risk patients. By contrast, empiric antifungals were widely used.","['Sun, Yuqian', 'Huang, He', 'Chen, Jing', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Ma, Jun', 'Li, Juan', 'Liang, Yingmin', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Li, Yan', 'Yu, Kang', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Jin, Jie', 'Wang, Chun', 'Wu, Depei', 'Xiao, Yang', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Sun Y', 'Huang H', 'Chen J', 'Li J', 'Ma J', 'Li J', 'Liang Y', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Yu K', 'Hu J', 'Jin J', 'Wang C', 'Wu D', 'Xiao Y', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', 'Fungi/drug effects/*pathogenicity', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', '*Risk Factors', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2649-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Feb;36(2):757-67. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2649-7.

The purpose of the study is to characterize beta2-M expression in molecular subtypes of breast cancer, thereby investigating the mechanism of beta2-M action in breast cancer. METHODS: beta2-M and B-Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) transcript expression levels in breast cancer tissue and the corresponding normal tissue were quantified using real-time PCR. The protein expression levels of beta2-M, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), tumor protein 53 (p53) and Ki67 were determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Following silencing of the beta2-M by siRNA, the levels of Bcl-2, ER, PR and HER-2 transcripts and the protein expression levels in human breast cancer cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: The expression of beta2-M transcripts demonstrated no significant differences between the four breast cancer molecular subtypes and no significant correlations with age, clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. beta2-M transcript expression demonstrated a positive correlation when compared to Bcl-2 transcript expression (P<0.05). The beta2-M protein expression was significantly higher in breast cancer when compared with benign breast tumors (P<0.01), and have no significant correlation with age, clinical stage or lymph node metastasis. There was a significant difference demonstrated in beta2-M protein expression in the four breast cancer molecular subtypes (P<0.05), and between the ER+ and ER- groups (P<0.01); however, no significant difference was demonstrated between the HER-2+ and HER-2- groups. beta2-M protein expression had a negative correlation with ER protein expression (P<0.01), a positive correlation with p53 protein expression (P<0.01), and no correlation with Ki67 protein expression. beta2-M silencing significantly inhibited Bcl-2 mRNA expression, but did not inhibit ER, PR and HER-2 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells (ER+, PR+ and HER-2-). In addition, Bcl-2 and HER-2 mRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells (ER-, PR- and HER-2-), which is consistent with the silencing effect seen at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: beta2-M expression demonstrated a significant difference in the four breast cancer molecular subtypes, and may be related to apoptosis regulation in breast cancer.","['Li, Kesheng', 'Du, Huifen', 'Lian, Xiaowen', 'Yang, Suisheng', 'Chai, Dandan', 'Wang, Chunya', 'Yang, Rong', 'Chen, Xuezhong']","['Li K', 'Du H', 'Lian X', 'Yang S', 'Chai D', 'Wang C', 'Yang R', 'Chen X']","['Department of Medicine Biotechnology, Medicine and Science Research Institute of Gansu Province, Lanzhou, China. likesheng63@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141007,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-750 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-750 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Oct 7;14:750. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-750.,,,PMC4197271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this editorial, we discuss the current evidence on imatinib generics based mainly on Turkish experience and other limited data available.","['Soysal, Teoman', 'Eskazan, Ahmet Emre', 'Ar, Muhlis Cem']","['Soysal T', 'Eskazan AE', 'Ar MC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Editorial'],20141008,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Drugs, Generic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Substitution', 'Drugs, Generic/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics', 'Piperazines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'generic', 'imatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2014/10/09 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.966679 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Dec;7(6):697-9. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.966679.

Platelets can be generated from cord blood progenitors and hESCs; however, the molecular mechanisms and determinants controlling the in vitro megakaryocytic specification of hESCs remain elusive. We have recently shown that stem cell leukemia (SCL) overexpression accelerates the emergence of hemato-endothelial progenitors from hESCs and promotes their subsequent differentiation into blood cells with higher clonogenic potential. Given that SCL participates in megakaryocytic commitment, we hypothesized that it may potentiate megakaryopoiesis from hESCs. We show that ectopic SCL expression enhances the emergence of megakaryocytic precursors, mature megakaryocytes (MKs), and platelets in vitro. SCL-overexpressing MKs and platelets respond to different activating stimuli similar to their control counterparts. Gene expression profiling of megakaryocytic precursors shows that SCL overexpression renders a megakaryopoietic molecular signature. Connectivity Map analysis reveals that trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), both histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, functionally mimic SCL-induced effects. Finally, we confirm that both TSA and SAHA treatment promote the emergence of CD34(+) progenitors, whereas valproic acid, another HDAC inhibitor, potentiates MK and platelet production. We demonstrate that SCL and HDAC inhibitors are megakaryopoiesis regulators in hESCs.","['Toscano, Miguel G', 'Navarro-Montero, Oscar', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Ramos-Mejia, Veronica', 'Guerrero-Carreno, Xiomara', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Romero, Tamara', 'Lamolda, Mar', 'Cobo, Marien', 'Martin, Francisco', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Real, Pedro J']","['Toscano MG', 'Navarro-Montero O', 'Ayllon V', 'Ramos-Mejia V', 'Guerrero-Carreno X', 'Bueno C', 'Romero T', 'Lamolda M', 'Cobo M', 'Martin F', 'Menendez P', 'Real PJ']","['1] Genomic Medicine Department, GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer-University of Granada-Andalusian Regional Government, PTS Granada, Granada, Spain [2] Current address: Amarna Therapeutics SL.

The purpose of the study was to compare the implantation rates of IVM- and in-vivo maturation (IVO)- derived embryos, and to evaluate their effects on uterine receptivity. METHODS: The IVM- and IVO- oocytes were obtained from female mice, fertilized and transferred to separate oviducts of the same pseudo-pregnant mice. After 5 days, the implanted blastocysts were dissected out of the uterine horns, and the uterine horns were analyzed for the expression of mRNAs encoding leukemia inhibitory factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4, progesterone receptor, and Hoxa-10. RESULTS: The maturation rate of the IVM- oocytes was 81.2%. The fertilization rate of the IVM oocytes was lower than that of the IVO oocytes (50.5% vs. 78.0%, p = 0.038), as was their implantation rate (14.5% vs. 74.7%, p < 0.001). All 5 mRNAs examined were expressed at significantly lower levels in the uterine horns that received the IVM-derived embryos than in those that received the IVO-derived embryos. CONCLUSIONS: The IVM-derived embryos are less competent in inducing expression of implantation-related mRNAs in the uterine horn.","['Lin, Yu-Hung', 'Tsai, Ching-Yen', 'Huang, Lee-Wen', 'Seow, Kok-Min', 'Hwang, Jiann-Loung', 'Tzeng, Chii-Ruey']","['Lin YH', 'Tsai CY', 'Huang LW', 'Seow KM', 'Hwang JL', 'Tzeng CR']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, No. 95, Wen Chang Road, Shih Lin District, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141008,Netherlands,J Assist Reprod Genet,Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,9206495,"['0 (Hbegf protein, mouse)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa11 protein, mouse)', '0 (IGFBPL-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor/biosynthesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Oocytes/*growth & development/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Progesterone/biosynthesis', 'Uterus/metabolism/*physiopathology']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10815-014-0354-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Assist Reprod Genet. 2014 Dec;31(12):1713-8. doi: 10.1007/s10815-014-0354-5.

Previous population-based incidences and survivals of childhood cancer in Thailand were determined using a short cancer registration period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved of all children residing in Khon Kaen, between 0-15 years, diagnosed as having cancer and registered in the KKCR (1985-2009). The follow-up censored date was December 31, 2012. The childhood cancers were classified into 12 diagnostic groups, according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. The incidence was calculated by the standard method. Survival of childhood cancer was investigated using the KKCR population-based registration data and overall survival calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: In the study period, 912 newly diagnosed cases of childhood cancer were registered. The respective mean and median age was 6.4 (SD=4.6) and 6 (0-14) years. The age-peak for incidence was 0-4 years. The age-standardized rate (ASR) was 83 per million. Leukemia was the most common cancer (N=360, ASR 33.8) followed by neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS, N=150, ASR 12.8) and lymphoma (N=79, ASR 7.0). The follow-up duration totaled 101,250 months. The death rate was 1.11 per 100 person-months (95%CI: 1.02 -1.20). The 5-year overall survival was 52% (95%CI: 53-56.9) for all cancers. The respective 5-year overall survival for (1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), (2) acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), (3) lymphoma, (4) germ cell tumors, (5) renal tumors, (6) retinoblastoma, (7) soft tissue tumors, (8) CNS tumors, (9) bone tumors, (10) liver tumors, and (11) neuroblastoma was (1) 51%, (2) 37%, (3) 63%, (4) 74%, (5) 67%, (6) 55%, (7) 46%, (8) 44%, (9) 36%, (10) 34%, and (11) 25%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood cancer is lower than those of western countries. Respective overall survival for ALL, lymphoma, renal tumors, liver tumors, retinoblastoma, soft tissue tumors is lower than that reported in developed countries while survival for CNS tumors, neuroblastoma and germ cell tumors is comparable.","['Wiangnon, Surapon', 'Jetsrisuparb, Arunee', 'Komvilaisak, Patcharee', 'Suwanrungruang, Krittika']","['Wiangnon S', 'Jetsrisuparb A', 'Komvilaisak P', 'Suwanrungruang K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand E-mail : suraponwiangnon@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', '*Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.18.7989 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(18):7989-93. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.18.7989.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin (IL)-18 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that induces potent NK cell-dependent anti-tumor responses when administrated with other cytokines. In this study, we explored the effects of combining IL-18 and IL-2 on NK cytotoxicity as well as expression levels of the NK cell receptor NKG2D in vitro. Freshly isolated PBMCs were incubated for 48 h with IL-18 and IL-2, then CD107a expression on CD3-CD56+ NK cells was determined by three-colour flow cytometry to evaluate the cytotoxicity of NK cells against human erythroleukemia K562 cells and human colon carcinoma HT29 cells. Flow cytometric analysis was also employed to determine NKG2D expression on NK cells. The combined use of IL-18 and IL-2 significantly increased CD107a expression on NK cells compared with using IL-18 or IL-2 alone, suggesting that the combination of these two cytokines exerted synergistic enhancement of NK cytotoxicity. IL-18 also enhanced NKG2D expression on NK cells when administered with IL-2. In addition, blockade of NKG2D signaling with NKG2D-blocking antibody attenuated the up-regulatory effect of combining IL-18 and IL-2 on NK cytolysis. Our data revealed that IL-18 synergized with IL-2 to dramatically enhance the cytolytic activity of human NK cells in a NKG2D-dependent manner. The results appear encouraging for the use of combined IL-18 and IL-2 in tumor immunotherapy.","['Qi, Yuan-Ying', 'Lu, Chao', 'Ju, Ying', 'Wang, Zi-E', 'Li, Yuan-Tang', 'Shen, Ya-Juan', 'Lu, Zhi-Ming']","['Qi YY', 'Lu C', 'Ju Y', 'Wang ZE', 'Li YT', 'Shen YJ', 'Lu ZM']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to ShandongUniversity, Jinan, Shandong, China E-mail : shenyajuanchina@126.com, luzhiming@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-18/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/10/09 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.18.7857 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(18):7857-61. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.18.7857.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional understanding of antitumor mechanisms and identification of predictive biomarkers are important for its clinical development. Here we demonstrate that while dinaciclib can effectively block cell cycle progression, in vitro and in vivo studies, coupled with mouse and human pharmacokinetics, support a model whereby induction of apoptosis is a main mechanism of dinaciclib's antitumor effect and relevant to the clinical duration of exposure. This was further underscored by kinetics of dinaciclib-induced downregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 and correlation of sensitivity with the MCL1-to-BCL-xL mRNA ratio or MCL1 amplification in solid tumor models in vitro and in vivo. This MCL1-dependent apoptotic mechanism was additionally supported by synergy with the BCL2, BCL-xL and BCL-w inhibitor navitoclax (ABT-263). These results provide the rationale for investigating MCL1 and BCL-xL as predictive biomarkers for dinaciclib antitumor response and testing combinations with BCL2 family member

We demonstrated that IFNgammaR signaling regulates alloreactive T cell trafficking to GvHD target organs through expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in alloreactive T cells. Since IFNgammaR signaling is mediated via JAK1/JAK2, we tested the effect of JAK1/JAK2 inhibition on GvHD. While we demonstrated that pharmacologic blockade of JAK1/JAK2 in WT T cells using the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, INCB018424 (Ruxolitinib), resulted in a similar effect to IFNgammaR-/- T cells both in vitro (reduction of CXCR3 expression in T cells) and in vivo (mitigation of GvHD after allo-HSCT), it remains to be determined if in vivo administration of INCB018424 will result in preservation of GvL while reducing GvHD. Here, we report that INCB018424 reduces GvHD and preserves the beneficial GvL effect in two different murine MHC-mismatched allo-HSCT models and using two different murine leukemia models (lymphoid leukemia and myeloid leukemia). In addition, prolonged administration of INCB018424 further improves survival after allo-HSCT and is superior to other JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, such as TG101348 or AZD1480.

Chem. Biol. 8, 486, 2012). It was proposed that this was done by inactivating peroxiredoxins (Prxs) 1 and 2 through the formation of an adduct specifically on the resolving Cys residue. We confirmed that adenanthin underwent Michael addition to isolated Prx2, thereby inhibiting oxidation to a disulfide-linked dimer. However, contrary to the original report, both the peroxidatic and the resolving Cys residues could be derivatized. Glutathione also formed an adenanthin adduct, reacting with a second-order rate constant of 25+/-5 M(-1) s(-1). With 50 microM adenanthin, the peroxidatic and resolving Cys of Prx2 reacted with half-times of 7 and 40 min, respectively, compared with 10 min for GSH. When erythrocytes or Jurkat T cells were treated with adenanthin, we saw no evidence for a reaction with Prxs 1 or 2. Instead, adenanthin caused time- and concentration-dependent loss of GSH followed by dimerization of the Prxs. Prxs undergo continuous oxidation in cells and are normally recycled by thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin. Our results indicate that Prx reduction was inhibited. We observed rapid inhibition of purified thioredoxin reductase (half-time 5 min with 2 microM adenanthin) and in cells, thioredoxin reductase was much more sensitive than GSH and loss of both preceded accumulation of oxidized Prxs. Thus, adenanthin is not a specific Prx inhibitor, and its reported antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects are more likely to involve more general inhibition of thioredoxin and/or glutathione redox pathways.","['Soethoudt, Marjolein', 'Peskin, Alexander V', 'Dickerhof, Nina', 'Paton, Louise N', 'Pace, Paul E', 'Winterbourn, Christine C']","['Soethoudt M', 'Peskin AV', 'Dickerhof N', 'Paton LN', 'Pace PE', 'Winterbourn CC']","['Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Centre for Free Radical Research, Department of Pathology, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.

The chromosomal abnormality t(14;18)(q32;q21) is most commonly associated with neoplasms of a follicular center cell origin. However, t(14;18) has also been reported in rare cases of CLL. OBJECTIVE: We describe the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, conventional, and molecular cytogenetic features of two rare cases proven to be CLL morphologically and immunologically in which t(14;18) was found as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. METHODS: Morphologic, flow cytometric analysis and molecular cytogenetic of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples were analyzed. RESULTS: Cytomorphologically, the cells were small mature lymphocytes without any findings that had characteristics of follicular lymphoma (FL) such as indented or clefted nuclei. Immunologic findings were characteristic of typical CLL without expression of CD10. A cytogenetic study revealed the two cases of CLL carrying t(14;18)(q32;q21). CONCLUSION: We concluded that CLL with t(14;18) is rare and should be differentiated from FL as the therapy is highly diverse between both diseases. Using immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) probes are important in the workup of patients with suspected CLL and suggest that the IGH probe should be used routinely in all CLL fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panels.","['Elyamany, Ghaleb', 'Fadalla, Kamal', 'Elghezal, Hatem', 'Alsuhaibani, Omar', 'Osman, Hani', 'Al-Abulaaly, Abdulaziz']","['Elyamany G', 'Fadalla K', 'Elghezal H', 'Alsuhaibani O', 'Osman H', 'Al-Abulaaly A']","['Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ; Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Adult Clinical Hematology and Stem cell Therapy, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Clinical Hematology and Stem cell Therapy, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Clinical Hematology and Stem cell Therapy, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140923,United States,Clin Med Insights Pathol,Clinical medicine insights.

The V617F mutation in the JAK2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) is present as an early somatic event in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and the study of these chronic myeloid malignancies provides an experimentally tractable approach to understanding early tumorigenesis. Introduction of exogenous JAK2V617F impairs replication fork progression and is associated with activation of the intra-S checkpoint, with both effects mediated by phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Analysis of clonally derived JAK2V617F-positive erythroblasts from MPN patients also demonstrated impaired replication fork progression accompanied by increased levels of replication protein A (RPA)-containing foci. However, the associated intra-S checkpoint response was impaired in erythroblasts from polycythemia vera (PV) patients, but not in those from essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients. Moreover, inhibition of p53 in PV erythroblasts resulted in more gamma-H2Ax (gamma-H2Ax)-marked double-stranded breaks compared with in like-treated ET erythroblasts, suggesting the defective intra-S checkpoint function seen in PV increases DNA damage in the context of attenuated p53 signaling. These results demonstrate oncogene-induced impairment of replication fork progression in primary cells from MPN patients, reveal unexpected disease-restricted differences in activation of the intra-S checkpoint, and have potential implications for the clonal evolution of malignancies.","['Chen, Edwin', 'Ahn, Jong Sook', 'Massie, Charlie E', 'Clynes, David', 'Godfrey, Anna L', 'Li, Juan', 'Park, Hyun Jung', 'Nangalia, Jyoti', 'Silber, Yvonne', 'Mullally, Ann', 'Gibbons, Richard J', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Chen E', 'Ahn JS', 'Massie CE', 'Clynes D', 'Godfrey AL', 'Li J', 'Park HJ', 'Nangalia J', 'Silber Y', 'Mullally A', 'Gibbons RJ', 'Green AR']","['Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom;', 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom;', 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom;', 'The Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom;', ""Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom; and."", 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom;', 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom;', ""Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom; and."", 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom;', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."", 'The Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom;', ""Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Medical Research Council/Wellcome Trust Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom; and arg1000@cam.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA Replication', 'Diploidy', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', '*S Phase', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2V617F', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'replication stress']",2014/10/08 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/10/08 06:00'],"['2014/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1401873111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1401873111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Oct 21;111(42):15190-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1401873111.

We report here that Erbin, an ErbB2-interacting protein that was thought to act as an antitumor factor, is specifically expressed in mammary luminal epithelial cells and facilitates ErbB2-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells and tumorigenesis in MMTV-neu transgenic mice. Disruption of their interaction decreases ErbB2-dependent proliferation, and deletion of the PDZ domain in Erbin hinders ErbB2-dependent tumor development in MMTV-neu mice. Mechanistically, Erbin forms a complex with ErbB2, promotes its interaction with the chaperon protein HSP90, and thus prevents its degradation. Finally, ErbB2 and Erbin expression correlates in human breast tumor tissues. Together, these observations establish Erbin as an ErbB2 regulator for breast tumor formation and progression.","['Tao, Yanmei', 'Shen, Chengyong', 'Luo, Shiwen', 'Traore, Wilfried', 'Marchetto, Sylvie', 'Santoni, Marie-Josee', 'Xu, Linlin', 'Wu, Biao', 'Shi, Chao', 'Mei, Jinghong', 'Bates, Ryan', 'Liu, Xihui', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Xiong, Wen-Cheng', 'Borg, Jean-Paul', 'Mei, Lin']","['Tao Y', 'Shen C', 'Luo S', 'Traore W', 'Marchetto S', 'Santoni MJ', 'Xu L', 'Wu B', 'Shi C', 'Mei J', 'Bates R', 'Liu X', 'Zhao K', 'Xiong WC', 'Borg JP', 'Mei L']","['Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine and Department of Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA 30912;

Yet contemporaneous US trends in spending on anticancer drugs known as oral oncologics have not been described. Using nationally representative data, we describe trends in national spending on and use of forty-seven oral oncologics between the first quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2011. Average quarterly national spending on oral oncologics increased 37 percent, from $940.3 million to $1.4 billion in 2012 dollars, a significant change. Average quarterly use of oral oncologics in the same time period measured in extended units increased at a significant pace but more slowly than spending (10 percent). Within this broader trend, differences in spending among categories of oral oncologics were observed. High levels of and increases in both spending and use were concentrated among new brand-name and patent-protected oral oncologics, including second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. Decreased spending but increased use was observed among oral oncologics that lost patent protection during the study period and were available in generic form, including hormonal therapies used to treat breast and prostate cancers. Spending on new and patent-protected oral oncologics and associated price increases are significant drivers of increased spending.","['Conti, Rena M', 'Fein, Adam J', 'Bhatta, Sumita S']","['Conti RM', 'Fein AJ', 'Bhatta SS']","['Rena M.

We evaluate the authenticity of ES cells in relation to cells in the embryo and examine their utility for dissecting mechanisms that confer pluripotency and that execute fate choice. We summarize current knowledge of the transcription factor circuitry that governs the ES cell state and discuss the opportunity to expose molecular logic further through iterative computational modeling and experimentation.

Therapy administration was shown to drive the selection of new TP53 mutations in CLL. Using ultra-deep next-generation sequencing (NGS), we performed a detailed analysis of TP53 mutations' clonal evolution. We retrospectively analyzed samples that were assessed as TP53-wild-type (wt) by FASAY from 20 patients with a new TP53 mutation detected in relapse and 40 patients remaining TP53-wt in relapse. Minor TP53-mutated subclones were disclosed in 18/20 patients experiencing later mutation selection, while only one minor-clone mutation was observed in those patients remaining TP53-wt (n=40). We documented that (i) minor TP53 mutations may be present before therapy and may occur in any relapse; (ii) the majority of TP53-mutated minor clones expand to dominant clone under the selective pressure of chemotherapy, while persistence of minor-clone mutations is rare; (iii) multiple minor-clone TP53 mutations are common and may simultaneously expand. In conclusion, patients with minor-clone TP53 mutations carry a high risk of mutation selection by therapy. Deep sequencing can shift TP53 mutation identification to a period before therapy administration, which might be of particular importance for clinical trials.","['Malcikova, J', 'Stano-Kozubik, K', 'Tichy, B', 'Kantorova, B', 'Pavlova, S', 'Tom, N', 'Radova, L', 'Smardova, J', 'Pardy, F', 'Doubek, M', 'Brychtova, Y', 'Mraz, M', 'Plevova, K', 'Diviskova, E', 'Oltova, A', 'Mayer, J', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Trbusek, M']","['Malcikova J', 'Stano-Kozubik K', 'Tichy B', 'Kantorova B', 'Pavlova S', 'Tom N', 'Radova L', 'Smardova J', 'Pardy F', 'Doubek M', 'Brychtova Y', 'Mraz M', 'Plevova K', 'Diviskova E', 'Oltova A', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S', 'Trbusek M']","['1] Center of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic [2] Department of Internal Medicine -

According to MRD assay results, bone marrow (BM) leukemic burden and the rate of its decline after treatment can be directly evaluated. Detailed knowledge of the leukemic burden in BM can minimize toxicity and treatment complications in patients by tailoring the therapeutic dose based on patients' conditions. In addition, reduction of MRD before allo-HSCT is an important prerequisite for reception of transplant by the patient. In direct examination of MRD by morphological methods (even by a professional hematologist), leukemic cells can be under- or over-estimated due to similarity with hematopoietic precursor cells. As a result, considering the importance of MRD, it is necessary to use other methods including flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and RQ-PCR to detect MRD. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In this review article, different MRD assay methods and their sensitivity, correlation of MRD assay results with clinical symptoms of the patient as well as pitfalls in results of these methods are evaluated. In the final section, recent advances in MRD have been addressed.","['Salari, Fatemeh', 'Shahjahani, Mohammad', 'Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Salari F', 'Shahjahani M', 'Shahrabi S', 'Saki N']","['Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141007,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy']",,,2014/10/08 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/10/08 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0266-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Nov;31(11):266. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0266-3.

Monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) provides information for patient stratification and individual risk-directed treatment. Cooperative studies have documented that measurement of blast clearance from the bone marrow during and after induction therapy identifies patient populations with different risk of relapse. We explored the possible contribution of measurements of MRD during the course of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used RQ-PCR to detect MRD in 110 unselected patients treated in Italy in the International Collaborative Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000). The trial took place in AIEOP centers during postinduction chemotherapy. Results were categorized as negative, low positive (below the quantitative range [< 5 x 10(-4)]), or high positive (>/= 5 x 10(-4)). Patients with at least one low-positive or high-positive result were assigned to the corresponding subgroup. RESULTS: Patients who tested high positive, low positive, or negative had significantly different cumulative incidences of leukemia relapse: 83.3%, 34.8%, and 8.6%, respectively (P < .001). Two thirds of positive cases were identified within 4 months after induction-consolidation therapy, suggesting that this time frame may be most suitable for cost-effective MRD monitoring, particularly in patients who did not clear their disease at the end of consolidation. CONCLUSION: These findings provide further insights into the dynamic of MRD and the ongoing effort to define molecular relapse in childhood ALL.","['Paganin, Maddalena', 'Fabbri, Giulia', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Polato, Katia', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Giraldi, Eugenia', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Paganin M', 'Fabbri G', 'Conter V', 'Barisone E', 'Polato K', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Giraldi E', 'Fagioli F', 'Arico M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Basso G']","['Maddalena Paganin, Giulia Fabbri, Katia Polato, and Giuseppe Basso, Universita di Padova, Padova;

Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that 89 apoptosis-associated genes were differentially expressed between patient acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CD34(+) cells and normal bone marrow (NBM) CD34(+) cells. Among these, transforming growth factor-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1) was strongly upregulated in AML CD34(+) cells. Genetic downmodulation or pharmacologic inhibition of TAK1 activity strongly impaired primary AML cell survival and cobblestone formation in stromal cocultures. TAK1 inhibition was mainly due to blockade of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway, as TAK1 inhibition resulted in reduced levels of P-IkappaBalpha and p65 activity. Overexpression of a constitutive active variant of NF-kappaB partially rescued TAK1-depleted cells from apoptosis. Importantly, NBM CD34(+) cells were less sensitive to TAK1 inhibition compared with AML CD34(+) cells. Knockdown of TAK1 also severely impaired leukemia development in vivo and prolonged overall survival in a humanized xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, our results indicate that TAK1 is frequently overexpressed in AML CD34(+) cells, and that TAK1 inhibition efficiently targets leukemic stem/progenitor cells in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner.","['Bosman, Matthieu Cornelis Johannes', 'Schepers, Hein', 'Jaques, Jennifer', 'Brouwers-Vos, Annet Zwaantien', 'Quax, Wim Johannes', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Bosman MC', 'Schepers H', 'Jaques J', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Quax WJ', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, and Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, and.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, and.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, and.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcriptome']",,,2014/10/08 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/10/08 06:00'],"['2014/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39662-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-569780 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 13;124(20):3130-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-569780.

FLT3 mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on bone marrow (BM) leukemic cells. IL10 gene promoter polymorphisms including rs1800896 (G-1082A), rs1800871 (C-819T), and rs1800872 (C-592T) were genotyped by direct sequencing. Among 45 enrolled patients, 32 (71.1 %) exhibited FLT3 overexpression, whose FLT3 mRNA level was higher than normal cut-off value (0.02). The IHC results also consisted with FLT3 mRNA expression data achieved by qPCR. The FLT3 mRNA level was significantly different among 3 IHC staining groups (P < 0.0001); 0.031 +/- 0.041, 0.106 +/- 0.097 and 0.588 +/- 0.573 in IHC negative, intermediate and positive group, respectively. Interestingly, the FLT3 expression level was correlated with the percentage of BM CD34 positive cells (R = 0.360, P = 0.016). The elevated FLT3 expression at initial BM were decreased after remission and maintained lower than the cut-off level. FLT3 expression was not dependent on IL10 gene promoter polymorphisms. FLT3 overexpression itself did not demonstrate significant effects on overall survival (OS). However, it is notable that IL10 rs1800896 GA genotype tended to have a lower estimated mean OS (20.1 months) compared to GG genotype (54.6 months), but the statistical significance was not derived because of limited number of patients in this study (P = 0.072).

In this study, the cellular effects underlying the enhanced cell killing are investigated. U937 and Molt-4 cell lines were exposed to 1.0 MHz US with 50% duty factor at 0.3 W/cm(2) and pulsed at 1, 5 and 10 Hz immediately after exposure to X-rays at 0, 0.5, 2.5 and 5 Gy. The cells were assayed at different time points to depict the major cellular events that culminated in cell death. For instance, membrane damage and cell lysis were estimated immediately following exposure and 24 h later. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also determined flow cytometrically after treatment. Moreover, the extent of DNA damage and cell cycle progression were determined at 6 and 24 h, respectively. Despite the general trend for synergism, there was a disproportionation of mediating factors depending on the cell type and its specific biological makeup. Immediately, US could induce appreciable necrotic cell death through extensive membrane damage in U937 but induced cell lysis in Molt-4 cells. ROS might have contributed to cell killing in Molt-4 but not in U937 cells. Although both of the physical modalities are significantly DNA-damaging alone, no additional damage was observed in combination. Moreover, override in some arrested cell cycle phases was also observed following combination. Collectively, the interaction between X-rays and US seems to depend mainly on the acoustic environment determined by the setup and this might explain the contradictory data among reports.","['Buldakov, Mikhail A', 'Hassan, Mariame A', 'Jawaid, Paras', 'Cherdyntseva, Nadejda V', 'Kondo, Takashi']","['Buldakov MA', 'Hassan MA', 'Jawaid P', 'Cherdyntseva NV', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan; Cancer Research Institute of Siberian capital VE, Cyrillicranch of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Tomsk, Russia; Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia.

In this study, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of Pten(-/-) T-ALL with defined blast and LIC-enriched cell populations to demonstrate that LICs are responsible for therapeutic resistance. Unlike acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, LICs in T-ALL were actively cycling, were distinct biologically, and responded differently to targeted therapies in comparison with their differentiated blast cell progeny. Notably, we found that T-ALL LICs could be eliminated by cotargeting the deregulated pathways driven by PI3K and Myc, which are altered commonly in human T-ALL and are associated with LIC formation. Our findings define critical events that may be targeted to eliminate LICs in T-ALL as a new strategy to treat the most aggressive relapsed forms of this disease.","['Schubbert, Suzanne', 'Cardenas, Anjelica', 'Chen, Harrison', 'Garcia, Consuelo', 'Guo, Wei', 'Bradner, James', 'Wu, Hong']","['Schubbert S', 'Cardenas A', 'Chen H', 'Garcia C', 'Guo W', 'Bradner J', 'Wu H']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.

BRPF1 contains a structurally conserved bromodomain, which recognizes specific acetyllysine residues on histone proteins. The MOZ HAT plays a direct role in hematopoiesis, and deregulation of its activity is linked to the development of acute myeloid leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism of histone-ligand recognition by the BRPF1 bromodomain is currently unknown. The 117-amino-acid BRPF1 bromodomain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Crystallization experiments of the BRPF1 bromodomain in complex with its H4K12ac and H2AK5ac histone ligands yielded crystals that were suitable for high-resolution X-ray diffraction analysis. The BRPF1 bromodomain-H4K12ac crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group P43212, with unit-cell parameters a = 75.1, b = 75.1, c = 86.3 A, and diffracted to a resolution of 1.94 A. The BRPF1 bromodomain-H2AK5ac crystals grew in the monoclinic space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 60.9, b = 55.6, c = 82.1 A, beta = 93.6 degrees , and diffracted to a resolution of 1.80 A. Complete data sets were collected from both crystal forms using synchrotron radiation on beamline X29 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).","['Lubula, Mulu Y', 'Poplawaski, Amanda', 'Glass, Karen C']","['Lubula MY', 'Poplawaski A', 'Glass KC']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Colchester, VT 05446, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Colchester, VT 05446, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Colchester, VT 05446, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,United States,Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun,"Acta crystallographica.

In the current report, we present the results of hematologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, chromosomal microarray and molecular analyses of a 60-year-old female patient diagnosed with AML-M2. Cytogenetic analysis revealed complex chromosomal findings involving seven different chromosomes. However, cytogenetic analyses were not able to precisely unveil all karyotypic changes, hence chromosomal microarray was used for further characterization. The most interesting observation was identification of a t(7;12) (q11;q22) as part of this complex karyotype.

METHODS: Seventy-five LBL patients were enrolled from January 2002 to October 2013, with 44 being treated with HyperCVAD and 31 being treated with CHOP regimen. The patients were followed up until 31 December 2013. Factors associated with the prognosis of the patients were analyzed using Logistic and COX regression models. RESULTS: The complete remission rate (73% vs. 23%) and overall response rate (91% vs. 46%) were both significantly higher in the patients receiving HyperCVAD regimen compared with those receiving CHOP regimen (P < 0.000 1). The follow-up lasted on average (median) 9.9 months (ranging from 1.3 to 41 months). The patients receiving HyperCVAD regimen had significantly longer overall survival (OS) (median 31.5 vs. 11 months, P = 0.012 7) and progression-free survival (PFS) time (median 16 vs. 5 months, P= 0.000 4) than those receiving CHOP regimen. Complete remission (CR) was negatively associated with increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, standard partial regression coefficent (beta) = -0.4793 and international prognostic index (IPI score > or = 3, beta = -0.691) in the patients receiving HyperCVAD regimen. The only significant predictor for survival was CR (relative risk (RR) = 0.146, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.044-0.488). Common adverse events of the two regimens were bone marrow suppression, pulmonary infection, liver dysfunction and hemorrhage. Patients receiving HyperCVAD regimen were more likely to suffer from bone marrow suppression (100% vs. 84%) and severe pulmonary infection (27% vs. 3%) than those receiving CHOP regimen (P < 0.05). No patient died of those adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared with CHOP regimen, HyperCVAD regimen can improve response rates and survival of LBL patients. Its higher level of pulmonary infection can be managed.","['Hu, Yuan', 'Zhao, Xia', 'Wu, Li-Li', 'Cai, Chang-Ping', 'Zhao, Wei-Li', 'Wang, Li']","['Hu Y', 'Zhao X', 'Wu LL', 'Cai CP', 'Zhao WL', 'Wang L']",,['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 23 patients with de novo adult AML-M2 carrying AML1/ETO fusion gene. GATA-2 gene expression was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). We analyzed the correlation between GATA-2 gene expression and laboratorial features and clinical prognosis of patients. RESULTS: GATA-2 expression levels (GATA-2 gene copies/reference gene copies) in the patients were found to be 2.17%-1 260.65%. A GATA-2 expression over or equal to 82% was defined as HIGH (10 cases), while an expression level below 82% was defined as LOW (13 cases). No significant differences were found in age, sex, white blood cell count or the rate of bone marrow blasts between HIGH and LOW expression groups (P > 0.05). Although the difference in complete remission rate between the two groups was not statistical significant (P = 0.067 8), the HIGH expression group had higher relapse rate (71.43% vs. 15.38%, P = 0.022 3) and higher mortality rate (70.00% vs. 7.69%, P < 0.05). The DFS and OS of the HIGH group are statistically significantly lower than that of the LOW group (P < 0.01). In the HIGH group, the patients choosing HSCT (2/10) are all alive without relapse, while among those choosing chemotherapy only (8/10), seven out of eight patients died. CONCLUSION: High expression level of GATA-2 in AML-M2 patients with AML1/ETO is associated with high risk of relapse and poor prognosis.

Pro-B and pre-B cases accounted for 43.55% and 59.86% of CD20- BCP patients respectively, compared with 56.45 and 40.14% in CD20- BCP patients (P = 0.007). CD20+ BCP patients had 12.20% Philadelphia positive ALL and 6.50% BCP-ALL with TEL-AML1 fusion gene, compared with 4.86% (P = 0.03) and 18.06% (P = 0.005) in those of CD20 BCP. No significant differences were found between the two groups of patients in 15-day (77.50% vs. 74.13%, P = 0.525) and 33-day (95.04% vs. 95.83%, P = 0.757) complete remission rates. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in predicted 4-year event-free survival CEFS (78.00% +/- 4.96%) vs. (79.05% +/- 5.40%)) and predicted 4-year overall survival (OS (83.01% +/- 6.13%) vs. (93.64% +/- 2.46%)) between the two groups of patients either. CONCLUSION: CD20 positivity was not found to be associated with worse prognosis of children with BCP-ALL. More studies are needed to validate the correlation between CD20 and unfavorable outcomes in BCP-ALL.","['Chen, Xiao-Xi', 'Yuan, Li-Xing', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Wan, Chao-Min', 'Huo, Wan-Ying', 'Tang, Xue', 'Ai, Yuan', 'Wan, Zhi', 'Zhu, Yi-Ping', 'Gao, Ju']","['Chen XX', 'Yuan LX', 'Zhang G', 'Wan CM', 'Huo WY', 'Tang X', 'Ai Y', 'Wan Z', 'Zhu YP', 'Gao J']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

METHODS: There were total 655 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia treated in one single-institution enrolled in this study. The dosage of TKI Imatinib was 400 mg/d for chronic phase, 600 mg/d for accelerated and blast phase respectively. Complete blood count, cytogenetic and molecular studies were regularly monitored during the course of therapy. The therapeutic effect was evaluated and the survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: The total complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) rates were 92.1%, 75.8%, 73.1% and 47.9% respectively. 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were (96.3 +/- 0.8)%, (86.3 +/-1.8)%, (79.0 +/- 2.4)% and (66.5 +/- 4.8)% respectively. 1 year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were (92.2 +/- 1.1)%, (77.9 +/- 2.1)%, (67.9 +/- 6.8)% and (35.8 +/- 6.0)% respectively. The proportion of the patients in chronic phase achieving CHR, MCyR, CCyR and MMR were 98.7%, 82.5%, 79.4% and 52.4% respectivly. Compared with chronic phase patients, the efficacy of IM in the treatment of accelerated phase and blast phase patients was significantly lower. The effect of TKI in early chronic phase was better than that in late chronic phase. Early molecular response was associated with a better 5-year EFS, but not OS. CONCLUSION: CML patients in chronic phase treated with TKI have a better outcome. The earlier TKI be used, the better the prognosis and efficacy be achieved.","['Li, Xiang-Long', 'Zhu, Huan-Ling', 'Liu, Hong-Ying', 'Lu, Su-Juan', 'Zheng, Su-Ping', 'Wu, Yu', 'Niu, Ting', 'Liu, Ting']","['Li XL', 'Zhu HL', 'Liu HY', 'Lu SJ', 'Zheng SP', 'Wu Y', 'Niu T', 'Liu T']",,['chi'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

In this study, we analyzed the immune characteristics of 99 consecutive previously diagnosed CLL patients and 50 healthy controls. The distribution of lymphocyte subsets at diagnosis was retrospectively analyzed. Compared with controls, leukemia patients showed an expansion of NK and CD8 T cells at diagnosis. The relative number of CD8 T cells at diagnosis was associated with time to treatment, suggesting that CD8 T cells may modify disease progression. The distribution of lymphocyte subsets was analyzed again when patients were enrolled in this study. The median time since these patients were diagnosed was 277 weeks. Compared with diagnosis, the absolute number of CD8 T cells significantly decreased in these patients, reaching similar values to healthy controls; however NK cells kept significantly elevated overtime. Nevertheless, NK cells showed an impaired expression of NKG2D receptor and a defective cytotoxic activity. This down-regulation of NKG2D expression was further enhanced in patients with advanced and progressive disease. Additionally, membrane NKG2D levels significantly decreased on CD8 T cells, but a significant increase of NKG2D+CD4+ T cells was observed in CLL patients. The cytotoxic activity of NK cells was diminished in CLL patients; however the treatments with IL-2, IL-15, IL-21 and lenalidomide were able to restore their activity. The effect of IL-2 and IL-15 was associated with the increase of NKG2D expression on immune cells, but the effect of IL-21 and lenalidomide was not due to NKG2D up-regulation. The expansion of NK cells and the reversibility of NK cell defects provide new opportunities for the immunotherapeutic intervention in CLL.","['Huergo-Zapico, Leticia', 'Acebes-Huerta, Andrea', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana Pilar', 'Contesti, Juan', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Esther', 'Payer, Angel R', 'Villa-Alvarez, Monica', 'Fernandez-Guizan, Azahara', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro', 'Gonzalez, Segundo']","['Huergo-Zapico L', 'Acebes-Huerta A', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'Contesti J', 'Gonzalez-Garcia E', 'Payer AR', 'Villa-Alvarez M', 'Fernandez-Guizan A', 'Lopez-Soto A', 'Gonzalez S']","['Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Cabuenes, Gijon, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Cabuenes, Gijon, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*metabolism', 'Prognosis']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0108326 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-24021 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 6;9(10):e108326. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0108326. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4186792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secreted soluble form of SCF exists as noncovalently associated homodimer and exerts its activity by signaling through the c-Kit receptor. In this report, we present the high level expression of a soluble recombinant human SCF (rhSCF) in Escherichia coli. A codon-optimized Profinity eXact-tagged hSCF cDNA was cloned into pET3b vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring a bacterial thioredoxin coexpression vector. The recombinant protein was purified via an affinity chromatography processed by cleavage with sodium fluoride, resulting in the complete proteolytic removal the N-terminal tag. Although almost none of the soluble fusion protein bound to the resin in standard protocol using 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), the use of binding buffer containing 0.5M l-arginine for protein stabilization dramatically enhanced binding to resin and recovery of the protein beyond expectation. Also pretreatment by Triton X-114 for removing endotoxin was effective for affinity chromatography. In chromatography performance, l-arginine was more effective than Triton X-114 treatment. Following Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, the target protein was isolated in high purity. The rhSCF protein specifically enhanced the viability of human myeloid leukemia cell line TF-1 and the proliferation and maturation of human mast cell line LAD2 cell. This novel protocol for the production of rhSCF is a simple, suitable, and efficient method.","['Akuta, Teruo', 'Kikuchi-Ueda, Takane', 'Imaizumi, Keitaro', 'Oshikane, Hiroyuki', 'Nakaki, Toshio', 'Okada, Yoko', 'Sultana, Sara', 'Kobayashi, Kenichiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Ono, Yasuo']","['Akuta T', 'Kikuchi-Ueda T', 'Imaizumi K', 'Oshikane H', 'Nakaki T', 'Okada Y', 'Sultana S', 'Kobayashi K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Ono Y']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, 2-11-1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8605, Japan; Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co.

Multiple oncogenic viral infections are frequently seen, with even Marek's disease vaccines reported to be contaminated with ALV and REV. The gross lesions caused by avian oncogenic viruses often overlap, making differentiation diagnosis based on histopathology difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a rapid approach to simultaneously differentiate, subgroup and pathotype the avian oncogenic viruses. The oligonucleotide microarray was employed in this study. Particular DNA sequences were recognized using specific hybridization between the DNA target and probe on the microarray, followed with colorimetric development through enzyme reaction. With 10 designed probes, ALV-A, ALV-E, ALV-J, REV, MDV pathogenic and vaccine strains were clearly discriminated on the microarray with the naked eyes. The detection limit was 27 copy numbers, which was 10-100 times lower than multiplex PCR.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. ANIMALS: 5,179 cats. PROCEDURES: Veterinarians at veterinary clinics and animal shelters completed online training on oral conditions in cats and then scored oral health status of cats with no known history of vaccination against FIV. Age, sex, and results of an ELISA for retroviruses were recorded. Results were analyzed by means of standard logistic regression with binary outcome. RESULTS: Of 5,179 cats, 237 (4.6%) and 186 (3.6%) were seropositive for FIV and FeLV, respectively, and of these, 12 (0.2%) were seropositive for FIV and FeLV. Of all 5,179 cats, 1,073 (20.7%) had gingivitis, 576 (11.1%) had periodontitis, 203 (3.9%) had stomatitis, and 252 (4.9%) had other oral conditions (overall oral disease prevalence, 2,104/5,179 [40.6%]). Across all age categories, inflammatory oral disease was associated with a significantly higher risk of a positive test result for FIV, compared with the seropositivity risk associated with other oral diseases or no oral disease. Stomatitis was most highly associated with risk of FIV seropositivity. Cats with any oral inflammatory disease were more likely than orally healthy cats to have a positive test result for FeLV. Increasing age was associated with a higher prevalence of oral disease in retrovirus-seronegative cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Inflammatory oral disease was associated with an increased risk of seropositivity for retroviruses in naturally infected cats. Therefore, retroviral status of cats with oral inflammatory disease should be determined and appropriate management initiated.","['Kornya, Matthew R', 'Little, Susan E', 'Scherk, Margie A', 'Sears, William C', 'Bienzle, Dorothee']","['Kornya MR', 'Little SE', 'Scherk MA', 'Sears WC', 'Bienzle D']","['Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Mouth Diseases/*veterinary/virology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Tumor Virus Infections/veterinary/virology']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/javma.245.8.916 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2014 Oct 15;245(8):916-22. doi: 10.2460/javma.245.8.916.,,,,,"['J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2014 Nov 15;245(10):1101.

To assess the impact of malnutrition after allogeneic HSCT on transplant outcomes, we conducted a retrospective study. Adult patients who received allogeneic HSCT from 2000 to 2009 for standard-risk leukemia and achieved disease-free survival up to 3 months after allogeneic HSCT were included. From participating centers, 145 patients were enrolled. Median age was 46 years (19-68). Patients were classified based on weight loss during 3 months after allogeneic HSCT as follows: normal group (weight loss <5%, n=53), mild malnutrition group (5%weight loss<10%, n=47), severe malnutrition group (10% weight loss, n=45). The cumulative incidences of 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 3.8% in the normal group, 8.5% in the mild malnutrition group and 27.3% in the severe malnutrition group. The probabilities of a 2-year OS were 73.2% in the normal group, 74.5% in the mild malnutrition group and 55.3% in the severe malnutrition group. In multivariate analysis, severe malnutrition was associated with an increased risk of NRM and a worse OS. In conclusion, weight loss 10% was associated with a worse clinical outcome.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Phase I evaluated the safety of obatoclax infused for 3 hours on 3 consecutive days (3 h x 3 d) in 2-week cycles. Initial obatoclax dose was 30 mg/day (3 h x 3 d; n = 3). Obatoclax was increased to 45 mg/day (3 h x 3 d) if </= 1 patient had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and decreased to 20 mg/day (3 h x 3 d) if DLT occurred in >/= 2 patients. In the phase II study, 12 patients were randomized to receive obatoclax at the dose identified during phase I (3 h x 3 d) or 60 mg/day administered by continuous infusion over 24 hours for 3 days (24 h x 3 d) to determine the morphologic complete response rate. RESULTS: In phase I, two of three patients receiving obatoclax 30 mg/day (3 h x 3 d) experienced grade 3 neurologic DLTs (confusion, ataxia, and somnolence). Obatoclax was decreased to 20 mg/day (3 h x 3 d). In phase II, no clinically relevant safety differences were observed between the 20 mg/day (3 h x 3 d; n = 7) and 60 mg/day (24 h x 3 d; n = 5) arms. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse events were most common and were generally transient and reversible. Complete response was not achieved in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Obatoclax 20 mg/day was the MTD (3 h x 3 d) in older patients with AML. In the schedules tested, single-agent obatoclax was not associated with an objective response. Evaluation in additional subgroups or in combination with other chemotherapy modalities may be considered for future study.

In this study, we report that Trithorax (Trx) actively maintains the heterogeneity of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) in the developing Drosophila larval brain. trx mutant type II neuroblasts gradually adopt a type I neuroblast functional identity, losing the competence to generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and directly generating differentiated cells. Trx regulates a type II neuroblast functional identity in part by maintaining chromatin in the buttonhead (btd) locus in an active state through the histone methyltransferase activity of the SET1/MLL complex. Consistently, btd is necessary and sufficient for eliciting a type II neuroblast functional identity. Furthermore, over-expression of btd restores the competence to generate INPs in trx mutant type II neuroblasts. Thus, Trx instructs a type II neuroblast functional identity by epigenetically promoting Btd expression, thereby maintaining neuroblast functional heterogeneity.","['Komori, Hideyuki', 'Xiao, Qi', 'Janssens, Derek H', 'Dou, Yali', 'Lee, Cheng-Yu']","['Komori H', 'Xiao Q', 'Janssens DH', 'Dou Y', 'Lee CY']","['Center for Stem Cell Biology, Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States.', 'Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology, Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141006,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (btd protein, Drosophila)', '0 (trx protein, Drosophila)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Set1 protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genetic Loci', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Larva/cytology/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['D. melanogaster', 'Trithorax', 'developmental biology', 'intermediate neural progenitor', 'larval brain', 'neural stem cells', 'neuroblast', 'stem cells']",2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7554/eLife.03502 [doi]'],epublish,Elife. 2014 Oct 6;3. doi: 10.7554/eLife.03502.,,"['R01 GM082856/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM092818/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4221733,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors report a case involving a 65-year-old man with nonconvulsive status epilepticus 34 days after umbilical cord blood transplantion for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum were positive for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed symmetric T2 hyper-intensity bilaterally in the mesial temporal lobes, and T2 hyperintensi-ties and restricted diffusion of bilateral putamina. Despite aggressive anticonvulsive therapy, his seizures only abated with initiation of ganciclovir therapy. The patient completed six weeks of combination antiviral therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet).

Autophagy plays an important role in the regulation of numerous physiological functions, including hematopoiesis, through elimination of aggregated/misfolded proteins, and damaged/superfluous organelles. The catabolic products of autophagy (amino acids, fatty acids, nucleotides) are released into the cytosol from autophagolysosomes and recycled into bio-energetic pathways. Therefore, autophagy allows cells to survive starvation and other unfavorable conditions, including hypoxia, heat shock, and microbial pathogens. Nevertheless, depending upon the cell context and functional status, autophagy can also serve as a death mechanism. The cohort of proteins that constitute the autophagy machinery function in a complex, multistep biochemical pathway which has been partially identified over the past decade. Dysregulation of autophagy may contribute to the development of several disorders, including acute leukemias. In this kind of hematologic malignancies, autophagy can either act as a chemo-resistance mechanism or have tumor suppressive functions, depending on the context. Therefore, strategies exploiting autophagy, either for activating or inhibiting it, could find a broad application for innovative treatment of acute leukemias and could significantly contribute to improved clinical outcomes. These aspects are discussed here after a brief introduction to the autophagic molecular machinery and its roles in hematopoiesis.","['Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Neri, Luca M', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'Lonetti A', 'Buontempo F', 'Neri LM', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.

Effects of AHR activation have been evaluated on rodent hepatic stem cells (rHpSCs) versus their descendants, hepatoblasts (rHBs), two lineage stages of multipotent, hepatic precursors with overlapping but also distinct phenotypic traits. This was made possible by defining the first successful culture conditions for ex vivo maintenance of rHpScs consisting of a substratum of hyaluronans and Kubota's medium (KM), a serum-free medium designed for endodermal stem/progenitor cells. Supplementation of KM with leukemia inhibitory factor elicited lineage restriction to rHBs. Cultures were treated with various AHR agonists including TCDD, 6-formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), and 3-3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and then analyzed with a combination of immunocytochemistry, gene expression, and high-content image analysis. The AHR agonists increased proliferation of rHpSCs at concentrations producing a persistent AHR activation as indicated by induction of Cyp1a1. By contrast, treatment with TCDD resulted in a rapid loss of viability of rHBs, even though the culture conditions, in the absence of the agonists, were permissive for survival and expansion of rHBs. The effects were not observed with FICZ and at lower concentrations of DIM. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with a lineage-dependent mode of action for AHR agonists in rodent liver tumorigenesis through selective expansion of rHpSCs in combination with a toxicity-induced loss of viability of rHBs. These lineage-dependent effects correlate with increased frequency of liver tumors.","['Harrill, Joshua A', 'Parks, Bethany B', 'Wauthier, Eliane', 'Rowlands, J Craig', 'Reid, Lola M', 'Thomas, Russell S']","['Harrill JA', 'Parks BB', 'Wauthier E', 'Rowlands JC', 'Reid LM', 'Thomas RS']","['Institute for Chemical Safety Sciences, Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150105,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/*toxicity', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*agonists', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/04/01 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.27547 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2015 Feb;61(2):548-60. doi: 10.1002/hep.27547.

A number of clones were generated using a Bax peptide pool and their T-cell epitope was mapped to two peptides sharing a common 9-aa sequence (LLSYFGTPT), restricted by HLA-A*0201. However, when these T-cell clones were tested against highly purified syntheses (>95%) of the same peptide sequence, there was no functional response. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis and HPLC fractionation suggested that the active component in the original crude peptide preparations (77% pure) was a peptide with a tert-butyl (tBu) modification of the tyrosine residue. This was confirmed by modification of the inactive wild type (wt) sequence to generate functionally active peptides. Computer modeling of peptide:HLA-A*0201 structures predicted that the tBu modification would not affect interactions between peptide residues and the HLA binding site. However these models did predict that the tBu modification of tyrosine would result in an extension of the side chain out of the peptide-binding groove up towards the TCR. This modified product formed <1% of the original P603 crude peptide preparation and <0.05% of the original 23 peptide mixture used for T-cell stimulation. The data presented here, illustrates the potential for chemical modifications to change the immunogenicity of synthetic peptides, and highlights the exquisite capacity of TCR to discriminate between structurally similar peptide sequences. Furthermore this study highlights potential pitfalls associated with the use of synthetic peptides for the monitoring and modulating of human immune responses. This article is protected by copyright.

Consequently, several studies have confirmed the efficacy of single agent CdA or CdA combination regimens in AML. Established CR rates for combination regimens in RR adults are approximately 50%, while CR rates for newly diagnosed (ND) adults are approximately 70% and show similar toxicity profiles to previously used regimens.

All had received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after total body irradiation (TBI, n = 201) or busulfan-based (n = 70) myeloablative conditioning regimen. TBI was fractionated in all but six patients. The mean duration of follow-up from HSCT was 10.3 years. Cataract was observed in 113/271 patients (41.7%); 9/113 (8.1%) needed surgery. Cumulative incidence after TBI increased over time from 30% at 5 years to 70.8% and 78% at 15 and 20 years, respectively, without any plateau thereafter. The 15-year cumulative incidence was 12.5% in the Busulfan group. A higher cumulative steroid dose appeared to be a cofactor of TBI for cataract risk, in both univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. In the multivariate analysis, cataract had an impact in two quality of life domains: 'the role limitation due to physical problems' and 'the role limitation due to emotional problems'. These data suggest that with increasing follow-up, nearly all patients who receive TBI, even when fractionated, will suffer from cataract that can impact on their quality of life and that high cumulative steroid dose is a cofactor.","['Horwitz, Meryl', 'Auquier, Pascal', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Contet, Audrey', 'Poiree, Maryline', 'Kanold, Justyna', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Plantaz, Dominique', 'Galambrun, Claire', 'Berbis, Julie', 'Villes, Virginie', 'Chastagner, Pascal', 'Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Oudin, Claire', 'Michel, Gerard']","['Horwitz M', 'Auquier P', 'Barlogis V', 'Contet A', 'Poiree M', 'Kanold J', 'Bertrand Y', 'Plantaz D', 'Galambrun C', 'Berbis J', 'Villes V', 'Chastagner P', 'Sirvent N', 'Oudin C', 'Michel G']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, APHM, Aix Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141004,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cataract/chemically induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Quality of Life', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['cataract', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'irradiation', 'late effects', 'leukaemia']",2014/10/07 06:00,2015/04/02 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13148 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Feb;168(4):518-25. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13148.

To date, few population-based genetic studies have been reported. This study describes the genetic analysis of 32 Israeli patients with SCN. PROCEDURES: Clinical data were retrieved from the prospective Israeli Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Registry. Recruitment included living and deceased patients who were diagnosed between 1982 and 2012, for whom molecular diagnosis was performed. ELANE, HAX1 and G6PC3 genes were sequenced in all patients, and GFI-1 and WAS genes were sequenced if other genes were wildtype. RESULTS: Eleven patients (34%) had heterozygous mutations in ELANE (10 kindreds), eight (25%) had homozygous mutations in G6PC3 (5 kindreds) and 13 (41%) had no detected mutations. No patients had mutations in HAX1 or WAS. Four of the eight patients with G6PC3 mutations had congenital anomalies. The probability of survival for all patients was 50% at age of 18. Deaths were mainly due to sepsis (5 patients, 4/5 not responding to G-CSF, none with G6PC3 mutation). Two patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and one myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), none with G6PC3 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We found a unique pattern of SCN mutations in Israel with homozygous G6PC3 mutations in eight (25%) patients, the highest frequency described so far. HAX1 mutations, reported mainly in Sweden and Iran, were absent. Patients with G6PC3 mutations had congenital anomalies, appeared to have a better response to G-CSF, and so far have not developed AML or MDS.","['Lebel, Asaf', 'Yacobovich, Joanne', 'Krasnov, Tanya', 'Koren, Ariel', 'Levin, Carina', 'Kaplinsky, Chaim', 'Ravel-Vilk, Shoshana', 'Laor, Ruth', 'Attias, Dina', 'Ben Barak, Ayelet', 'Shtager, Dalia', 'Stein, Jerry', 'Kuperman, Amir', 'Miskin, Hagit', 'Dgany, Orly', 'Giri, Neelam', 'Alter, Blanche P', 'Tamary, Hannah']","['Lebel A', 'Yacobovich J', 'Krasnov T', 'Koren A', 'Levin C', 'Kaplinsky C', 'Ravel-Vilk S', 'Laor R', 'Attias D', 'Ben Barak A', 'Shtager D', 'Stein J', 'Kuperman A', 'Miskin H', 'Dgany O', 'Giri N', 'Alter BP', 'Tamary H']","[""Department of Pediatrics B, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141004,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (HAX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WAS protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.9 (Glucose-6-Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.9.

Reports of excess toxicity have resulted in GO's licence being withdrawn. As a result, the role of these agents remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis included studies of patients with AML who had entered a randomised control trial (RCT), where one arm included anti-CD33 antibody therapy. Fixed effect meta-analysis was used, involving calculation of observed minus expected number of events, and variance for each endpoint in each trial, with the overall treatment effect expressed as Peto's odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval. Meta-analysis of 11 RCTs with 13 randomisations involving GO was undertaken. Although GO increased induction deaths (p = 0.02), it led to a reduction in resistant disease (p = 0.0009); hence, there was no improvement in complete remission. Whilst GO improved relapse-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.90, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.84-0.98, p = 0.01), there was no overall benefit of GO in overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.96, 95 % CI = 0.90-1.02, p = 0.2). GO improved OS in patients with favourable cytogenetics, with no evidence of benefit in patients with intermediate or adverse cytogenetics (test for heterogeneity between subtotals p = 0.01). GO has a potent clinically detectable anti-leukaemic effect. Further trials to investigate its optimum delivery and identification of patient populations who may benefit are needed.","['Loke, J', 'Khan, J N', 'Wilson, J S', 'Craddock, C', 'Wheatley, K']","['Loke J', 'Khan JN', 'Wilson JS', 'Craddock C', 'Wheatley K']","['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20141005,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2218-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Mar;94(3):361-73. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2218-6.

The NKL cell line, derived from an aggressive Asian NK cell leukaemia, and patient samples from chronic NK-LGL leukaemia were used in our study to probe for synergistic efficacy of the epigenetic drugs vorinostat (SAHA) and cladribine in this disease. We demonstrate that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are over-expressed in both aggressive and chronic NK leukaemia. Administration of the HDAC inhibitor SAHA reduces class I and II HDAC expression and enhances histone acetylation in leukaemic NK cells. In vitro combination treatment with SAHA and cladribine dose-dependently exerts synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on leukaemic NK cells. Expression profiling of apoptotic regulatory genes suggests that both compounds led to caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor pathways. Collectively, these data show that combined epigenetic therapy, using HDAC and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, may be a promising therapeutic approach for NK-LGL leukaemia.","['Sun, Xiaoshen', 'Hasanali, Zainul S', 'Chen, Allshine', 'Zhang, Dianzheng', 'Liu, Xin', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Sun X', 'Hasanali ZS', 'Chen A', 'Zhang D', 'Liu X', 'Wang HG', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Xu K']","['The Key Laboratory of Transplantation Immunity, Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141004,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vorinostat']",['NOTNLM'],"['cladribine', 'combined epigenetic therapy', 'histone deacetylation', 'natural killer large granular lymphocyte leukaemia', 'vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid)']",2014/10/07 06:00,2015/03/24 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13143 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Feb;168(3):371-83. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13143.

No information is available on the relations between the IL-31/IL-31R complex and B-cell lymphoma. Here we have addressed this issue in follicular lymphoma (FL), a prototypic germinal center(GC)-derived B-cell malignancy. IL-31 enhanced primary FL cell proliferation through IL-31R-driven signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1/3 (STAT1/3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, GC B cells did not signal to IL-31 in spite of IL-31R expression. GC B cells expressed predominantly the inhibitory short IL-31RA isoform, whereas FL cells expressed predominantly the long signaling isoform. Moreover, GC B cells lacked expression of other IL-31RA isoforms potentially involved in the signaling pathway. IL-31 protein expression was significantly higher in surface membrane than in cytosol of both FL and GC B cells. IL-31 was detected in plasma membrane microvesicles from both cell types but not released in soluble form in culture supernatants. IL-31 and IL-31RA expression was higher in lymph nodes from FL patients with grade IIIa compared with grade I/II, suggesting a paracrine and/or autocrine role of IL-31/IL-31RA complex in tumor progression through microvesicle shedding.","['Ferretti, E', 'Tripodo, C', 'Pagnan, G', 'Guarnotta, C', 'Marimpietri, D', 'Corrias, M V', 'Ribatti, D', 'Zupo, S', 'Fraternali-Orcioni, G', 'Ravetti, J L', 'Pistoia, V', 'Corcione, A']","['Ferretti E', 'Tripodo C', 'Pagnan G', 'Guarnotta C', 'Marimpietri D', 'Corrias MV', 'Ribatti D', 'Zupo S', 'Fraternali-Orcioni G', 'Ravetti JL', 'Pistoia V', 'Corcione A']","['Laboratorio di Oncologia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Tumor Immunology Unit, Department of Health Science, Human Pathology Section, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Oncologia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Tumor Immunology Unit, Department of Health Science, Human Pathology Section, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Oncologia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Oncologia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, University of Bari Medical School, Bari and National Cancer Institute ""Giovanni Paolo II"", Bari, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Diagnostics of Lymphoproliferative Disorders, National Cancer Research Institute, Genova, Italy.', 'Unit of Pathology, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-IST-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.', 'Unit of Pathology, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-IST-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Oncologia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Oncologia, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (IL31 protein, human)', '0 (IL31RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Germinal Center/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014291 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.291 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):958-67. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.291.

The primary effect of Lmo2 is to cause self-renewal of developing CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative, DN) T cells in the thymus, leading to serially transplantable thymocytes that eventually give rise to leukemia. These self-renewing thymocytes are intrinsically radioresistant implying that they may be a source of leukemia relapse after therapy. The homeobox transcription factor, Hhex, is highly upregulated in Lmo2-transgenic thymocytes and can phenocopy Lmo2 in inducing thymocyte self-renewal, implying that Hhex may be a key component of the Lmo2-induced self-renewal program. To test this, we conditionally deleted Hhex in the thymi of Lmo2-transgenic mice. Surprisingly, this did not prevent accumulation of DN thymocytes, nor alter the rate of overt leukemia development. However, deletion of Hhex abolished the transplantation capacity of Lmo2-transgenic thymocytes and overcame their radioresistance. We found that Hhex regulates Kit expression in Lmo2-transgenic thymocytes and that abrogation of Kit signaling phenocopied loss of Hhex in abolishing the transplantation capacity and radioresistance of these cells. Thus, targeting the Kit signaling pathway may facilitate the eradication of leukemia-initiating cells in immature T-cell leukemias in which it is expressed.","['Shields, B J', 'Alserihi, R', 'Nasa, C', 'Bogue, C', 'Alexander, W S', 'McCormack, M P']","['Shields BJ', 'Alserihi R', 'Nasa C', 'Bogue C', 'Alexander WS', 'McCormack MP']","['1] Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '1] Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', '1] Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '1] Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Hhex protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymocytes/*metabolism/pathology/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/*metabolism/pathology/radiation effects', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014292 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.292 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):927-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.292.

For a rare subtype of AML (acute promyeloctyic leukemia, 5-10% of cases), all-trans retinoic acid therapy removes the differentiation block, yielding over a 90% cure rate. However, this treatment is not effective for the other 90-95% of AML patients, suggesting that new differentiation strategies are needed. Interestingly, differentiation is induced in normal hematopoietic cells through Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and TLRs are expressed on AML cells. We present evidence that the TLR8 activation promotes AML differentiation and growth inhibition in a TLR8/MyD88/p38-dependent manner. We also show that that TLR7/TLR8 agonist, R848, considerably impairs the growth of human AML cells in immunodeficient mice. Our data suggests TLR8 activation has direct anti-leukemic effects independent of its immunomodulating properties that are currently under investigation for cancer therapy. Taken together, our results suggest that treatment with TLR8 agonists may be a promising new therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Ignatz-Hoover, James J', 'Wang, Huaiyu', 'Moreton, Stephen A', 'Chakrabarti, Amit', 'Agarwal, Mukesh K', 'Sun, Kevin', 'Gupta, Kalpana', 'Wald, David N']","['Ignatz-Hoover JJ', 'Wang H', 'Moreton SA', 'Chakrabarti A', 'Agarwal MK', 'Sun K', 'Gupta K', 'Wald DN']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH.', ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH.', 'Invenio Therapeutics, Cleveland, OH.', 'Invenio Therapeutics, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (TLR8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlr7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2014.293 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):918-926. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.293.

Here, we report that AZD1775 interacted synergistically with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs, for example, Vorinostat), which interrupt the DNA damage response, to kill p53-wild type (wt) or -deficient as well as FLT3-ITD leukemia cells in association with pronounced Wee1 inhibition and diminished cdc2/Cdk1 Y15 phosphorylation. Similarly, Wee1 shRNA knockdown significantly sensitized cells to HDACIs. Although AZD1775 induced Chk1 activation, reflected by markedly increased Chk1 S296/S317/S345 phosphorylation leading to inhibitory T14 phosphorylation of cdc2/Cdk1, these compensatory responses were sharply abrogated by HDACIs. This was accompanied by premature mitotic entry, multiple mitotic abnormalities and accumulation of early S-phase cells displaying increased newly replicated DNA, culminating in robust DNA damage and apoptosis. The regimen was active against patient-derived acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells harboring either wt or mutant p53 and various next-generation sequencing-defined mutations. Primitive CD34(+)/CD123(+)/CD38(-) populations enriched for leukemia-initiating progenitors, but not normal CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, were highly susceptible to this regimen. Finally, combining AZD1775 with Vorinostat in AML murine xenografts significantly reduced tumor burden and prolonged animal survival. A strategy combining Wee1 with HDACI inhibition warrants further investigation in AML with poor prognostic genetic aberrations.","['Zhou, L', 'Zhang, Y', 'Chen, S', 'Kmieciak, M', 'Leng, Y', 'Lin, H', 'Rizzo, K A', 'Dumur, C I', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez, A', 'Dai, Y', 'Grant, S']","['Zhou L', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen S', 'Kmieciak M', 'Leng Y', 'Lin H', 'Rizzo KA', 'Dumur CI', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez A', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA [2] National Engineering Laboratory for Druggable Gene and Protein Screening, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA [2] Department of Hematology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA [2] Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center and Virginia Institute of Molecular Medicine, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141006,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/07 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014296 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.296 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):807-18. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.296.

For example, such changes can dramatically alter the function and cellular localization of transcription factors. With this in mind, we addressed whether EKLF/KLF1 mRNA, coding for a transcription factor that plays a critical role in erythropoietic gene regulation, is alternatively spliced. We find that EKLF mRNA undergoes exon skipping only in primary tissues and that this splice variant (SV) remains at a very low level in both embryonic and adult erythroid cells, as well as during terminal differentiation. The resultant protein is truncated and partially encodes a non-erythroid Kruppel-like factor amino acid sequence. Its overexpression can alter full-length erythroid Kruppel-like factor function at selected promoters. We discuss these results in the context of stress and with respect to recent global studies on the role of alternative splicing during terminal erythroid differentiation.","['Yien, Yvette Y', 'Gnanapragasam, Merlin Nithya', 'Gupta, Ritama', 'Rivella, Stefano', 'Bieker, James J']","['Yien YY', 'Gnanapragasam MN', 'Gupta R', 'Rivella S', 'Bieker JJ']","['Department of Developmental & Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Developmental & Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Developmental & Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States; Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States; Tisch Cancer Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.

Previous studies established enhanced disease-associated expression of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins (Neu5,9Ac2-GPs) on lymphoblasts of these patients at diagnosis, followed by its decrease with clinical remission and reappearance with relapse.

However, cancer treatment itself can compromise fertility, especially exposure to alkylating agents and whole body irradiation, which cause substantial germ cell loss. Children and adolescents with testicular cancer, leukaemia, and Ewing sarcomas are at the highest risk of developing permanent sterility from cancer treatment. Consequently, various strategies to preserve fertility are necessary. Sperm cryopreservation is an effective but underused method to safeguard spermatozoa. In the past few years, large advances have been made in prepubertal germ cell storage aimed at subsequent transplantation of testicular tissue and associated stem cells. Although still experimental, these approaches offer hope to many men in whom germ cell loss is associated with sterility. The derivation of male gametes from stem cells also holds much promise; however, data are only available in animals, and the use of this method in human beings is probably many years away.","['Tournaye, Herman', 'Dohle, Gert R', 'Barratt, Christopher L R']","['Tournaye H', 'Dohle GR', 'Barratt CL']","['Centre for Reproductive Medicine, University Hospital of the Free University Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.

Current practices for treatment of prostate cancer are less than satisfactory because of metastasis and recurrence, which are primarily attributed to angiogenesis. Hence, anti-angiogenesis treatment is becoming a promising new approach for prostate cancer therapy. In addition to treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ) suppresses other solid tumors, including prostate cancer. However, the effects of As2 O3 on angiogenesis in prostate cancer cells, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, As2 O3 attenuated angiogenic ability through microRNA-155 (miR-155)-mediated inhibition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)/SMAD signal pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 and LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Briefly, As2 O3 inhibited the activations/expressions of both TGFbeta-induced and endogenous SMAD2/3. Furthermore, As2 O3 improved the expression of miR-155 via DNA-demethylation. MiR-155, which targeted the SMAD2-3'UTR, decreased the expression and function of SMAD2. Knockdown of miR-155 abolished the As2 O3 -induced inhibitions of the TGF-beta/SMAD2 signaling, the vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and angiogenesis. Through understanding a novel mechanism whereby As2 O3 inhibits angiogenic potential of prostate cancer cells, our study would help in the development of As2 O3 as a potential chemopreventive agent when used alone or in combination with other current anticancer drugs.","['Ji, Hui', 'Li, Yuan', 'Jiang, Fei', 'Wang, Xingxing', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Shen, Jian', 'Yang, Xiaojun']","['Ji H', 'Li Y', 'Jiang F', 'Wang X', 'Zhang J', 'Shen J', 'Yang X']","['Affiliated Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141105,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'DNA-demethylation', 'TGF-beta/SMAD signaling', 'arsenic trioxide', 'microRNA-155']",2014/10/07 06:00,2015/02/18 06:00,['2014/10/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12548 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Dec;105(12):1541-9. doi: 10.1111/cas.12548.

These findings demonstrate that cordycepin is cytotoxic to human leukemia cells and suppresses telomerase activity through transcriptional and post-translational suppression of hTERT by inactivating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","['Jang, Kyung-Jun', 'Kwon, Gi-Sun', 'Jeong, Jin-Woo', 'Kim, Cheol-Hong', 'Yoon, Hyun-Min', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Shim, Jung-Hyun', 'Moon, Sung-Kwon', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Jang KJ', 'Kwon GS', 'Jeong JW', 'Kim CH', 'Yoon HM', 'Kim GY', 'Shim JH', 'Moon SK', 'Kim WJ', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju 690-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam 534-729, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Food Science and Technology, Chung-Ang University, Ansung 456-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Urology, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju 361-804, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea; Anti-Aging Research Center & Blue-Bio Industry RIC, Dongeui University, Busan 614-714, Republic of Korea.

Mutational analyses suggest that interaction between the MLLT1/3 proteins and AFF family proteins are required for experimental transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we define a specific pairing of two amino acids that creates a salt bridge between MLLT1/3 and AFF proteins that is critically important for MLL-mediated transformation of HPCs. Our findings, coupled with the newly defined structure of MLLT3 in complex with AFF1, should facilitate the development of small molecules that block this amino acid interaction and interfere with the activity of the most common MLL oncoproteins.","['Lokken, Alyson A', 'Achille, Nicholas J', 'Chang, Ming-Jin', 'Lin, Jeffrey J', 'Kuntimaddi, Aravinda', 'Leach, Benjamin I', 'Malik, Bhavna', 'Nesbit, Jacqueline B', 'Zhang, Shubin', 'Bushweller, John H', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Hemenway, Charles S']","['Lokken AA', 'Achille NJ', 'Chang MJ', 'Lin JJ', 'Kuntimaddi A', 'Leach BI', 'Malik B', 'Nesbit JB', 'Zhang S', 'Bushweller JH', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Hemenway CS']","['The Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.', 'Oncology Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, United States.', 'The Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, United States.', 'Oncology Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, United States.', 'Oncology Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, United States; Department of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.

In contrast, TRIM24 in the mouse is reportedly a liver-specific tumour suppressor. To address this dichotomy and to uncover direct regulatory functions of TRIM24 in vivo, we developed a new mouse model that lacks expression of all Trim24 isoforms, as the previous model expressed normal levels of Trim24 lacking only exon 4. METHODS: To produce germline-deleted Trim24(dlE1) mice, deletion of the promoter and exon 1 of Trim24 was induced in Trim24(LoxP) mice by crossing with a zona pellucida 3-Cre line for global deletion. Liver-specific deletion (Trim24(hep)) was achieved by crossing with an albumin-Cre line. Phenotypic analyses were complemented by protein, gene-specific and global RNA expression analyses and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Global loss of Trim24 disrupted hepatic homeostasis in 100% of mice with highly significant, decreased expression of oxidation/reduction, steroid, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism genes, as well as increased expression of genes involved in unfolded protein response, endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell cycle pathways. Trim24(dlE1/dlE1) mice have markedly depleted visceral fat and, like Trim24(hep/hep) mice, spontaneously develop hepatic lipid-filled lesions, steatosis, hepatic injury, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: TRIM24, an epigenetic co-regulator of transcription, directly and indirectly represses hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, fibrosis and damage in the murine liver. Complete loss of Trim24 offers a model of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatosis, fibrosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high-fat diet or obesity.","['Jiang, Shiming', 'Minter, Lindsey Cauthen', 'Stratton, Sabrina A', 'Yang, Peirong', 'Abbas, Hussein A', 'Akdemir, Zeynep Coban', 'Pant, Vinod', 'Post, Sean', 'Gagea, Mihai', 'Lee, Richard G', 'Lozano, Guillermina', 'Barton, Michelle Craig']","['Jiang S', 'Minter LC', 'Stratton SA', 'Yang P', 'Abbas HA', 'Akdemir ZC', 'Pant V', 'Post S', 'Gagea M', 'Lee RG', 'Lozano G', 'Barton MC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Cancer Epigenetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Cancer Epigenetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Cancer Epigenetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Cancer Epigenetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Center for Cancer Epigenetics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.

We correlated NK cell genotype and phenotype at diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The NK cells and leukemia blasts of 244 patients were analyzed at diagnosis by killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) typing and immunophenotyping. The results were correlated statistically with postinduction MRD status. RESULTS: The odds of being MRD positive in patients with KIR telomeric (Tel)-A/B genotype were 2.85 times the odds in those with Tel-A/A genotype (P = 0.035). MRD-positive patients were more likely to have KIR2DL5A (P = 0.006) and expressed less activating receptor NKp46 and FASL on their NK cells (P = 0.0074 and P = 0.029, respectively). The odds of being MRD positive increased by 2.01-fold for every percentage increase in NK cells expressing KIR2DL1 in the presence of HLA-C2 ligand (P = 0.034). The quantity of granzyme B inhibitor PI-9 in the leukemia blasts was greater in patients who were MRD positive (P = 0.038). Collectively, five NK cell-related factors (Tel-B-associated KIR2DL5A, NKp46, FASL, granzyme B, and PI-9) are strongly associated with MRD positivity at the end of induction with 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that NK cells with a strong effector phenotype in the setting of decreased leukemia resistance are associated with better leukemia control.","['Sullivan, Erin M', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Kang, Guolian', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Rooney, Barbara', 'Holladay, Martha', 'Bari, Rafijul', 'Schell, Sarah', 'Tuggle, MaCal', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Leung, Wing']","['Sullivan EM', 'Jeha S', 'Kang G', 'Cheng C', 'Rooney B', 'Holladay M', 'Bari R', 'Schell S', 'Tuggle M', 'Pui CH', 'Leung W']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.

To define optimal salvage strategy and identify patients unsuitable for retreatment with FCR, we examined the survival and treatment outcome of 300 patients enrolled in a phase 2 study of FCR. After a median 142 months of follow-up, 156 patients developed progressive CLL, with a median survival of 51 months after disease progression. The duration of first remission (REM1) was a key determinant of survival after disease progression and first salvage. Patients with a short REM1 (<3 years) had a short survival period, irrespective of salvage therapy received; these patients have high unmet medical needs and are good candidates for investigation of novel therapies. In patients with a long REM1 (>/=3 years), salvage treatment with either repeat FCR or lenalidomide-based therapy results in subsequent median survival exceeding 5 years; for these patients, FCR rechallenge represents a reasonable standard of care.","['Tam, Constantine S', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Plunkett, William', 'Wierda, William', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Khouri, Issa', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tam CS', ""O'Brien S"", 'Plunkett W', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wang X', 'Do KA', 'Cortes J', 'Khouri I', 'Kantarjian H', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ']","['Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Hematology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Biostatistics Department and.', 'Biostatistics Department and.', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Leukemia Department, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141003,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Rituximab', '*Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,2014/10/05 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/10/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39654-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-583765 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 13;124(20):3059-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-583765.

The molecular pathogenesis has partly been uncovered by the recent discovery of somatic activating STAT3 and STAT5b mutations. Here we show that 43% (75/174) of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and 18% (7/39) with chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells harbor STAT3 mutations when analyzed by quantitative deep amplicon sequencing. Surprisingly, 17% of the STAT3-mutated patients carried multiple STAT3 mutations, which were located in different lymphocyte clones. The size of the mutated clone correlated well with the degree of clonal expansion of the T-cell repertoire analyzed by T-cell receptor beta chain deep sequencing. The analysis of sequential samples suggested that current immunosuppressive therapy is not able to reduce the level of the mutated clone in most cases, thus warranting the search for novel targeted therapies. Our findings imply that the clonal landscape of large granular lymphocytic leukemia is more complex than considered before, and a substantial number of patients have multiple lymphocyte subclones harboring different STAT3 mutations, thus mimicking the situation in acute leukemia.","['Rajala, Hanna L M', 'Olson, Thomas', 'Clemente, Michael J', 'Lagstrom, Sonja', 'Ellonen, Pekka', 'Lundan, Tuija', 'Hamm, David E', 'Zaman, Syed Arshi Uz', 'Lopez Marti, Jesus M', 'Andersson, Emma I', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Rajala HL', 'Olson T', 'Clemente MJ', 'Lagstrom S', 'Ellonen P', 'Lundan T', 'Hamm DE', 'Zaman SA', 'Lopez Marti JM', 'Andersson EI', 'Jerez A', 'Porkka K', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Loughran TP', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and TYKSLAB, University of Turku and Turku University Central Hospital, Finland.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer, Universidad de Murcia, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland satu.mustjoki@helsinki.fi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141003,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/05 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/10/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.113142 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.113142 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jan;100(1):91-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.113142.

RESULTS: Patients with AML DNMT3A/FLT3/NPM1 (n = 35) were significantly younger (median, 56.0 vs. 62.0 years; p = 0.025), mostly women (65.7% vs. 46.9%; p = 0.045), and presented with a higher percentage of bone marrow blasts (p < 0.001) and normal cytogenetics (p = 0.024) in comparison to patients within other mutation groups in this study. Among patients <60 years old, those with AML DNMT3A/FLT3/NPM1 had a shorter event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.047). DNMT3A mutations and not FLT3 or NPM1 mutations were independently associated with overall survival (OS) (p = 0.026). Within mutation subgroups, patients with AML DNMT3A/NPM1 had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with AML FLT3-ITD/NPM1 (p = 0.047) suggesting that the adverse impact of DNMT3A mutations is more pronounced than that of FLT3-ITD among patients with NPM1 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A has a significant dominant effect on the clinical features and outcomes of de novo AML patients with concurrent DNMT3A, FLT3 and NPM1 mutations.","['Loghavi, Sanam', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Singh, Rajesh R', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Stingo, Francesco', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Loghavi S', 'Zuo Z', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Zhang L', 'Singh RR', 'Patel KP', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Stingo F', 'Routbort M', 'Cortes J', 'Luthra R', 'Khoury JD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141004,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2014/10/05 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/10/05 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0074-4 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0074-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Oct 4;7:74. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0074-4.,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4197326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a population-based case-control study, using conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of HM death, with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and p trends, in relation to tertiles of time-weighted average residential proximity to the refinery. We identified 177 HM deaths and 349 sex- and age-matched controls from municipal files. Confounding factors were investigated from interviews with consenting relatives for 109 HM deaths and 178 matched controls. RESULTS: For males and females combined, risk of HM death was unrelated to residential proximity. For females, ORs of HM death by increasing tertiles of proximity were 1, 2.74 (95 % CI 1.48-5.09, significant) and 1.49 (95 % CI 0.76-2.92) (p trend 0.184). For the subgroup of persons who plausibly spent most of their time at home (long-term retired, homemakers or unemployed, 53 cases, 79 controls), the ORs of leukemia plus non-Hodgkin lymphoma death (38 cases, 56 controls) by increasing tertiles of proximity were 1, 3.44 (95 % CI 1.04-11.37, significant) and 3.25 (95 % CI 0.82-12.87) (p trend 0.083). CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of HM death for males and females combined living close to the refinery was found. However, the findings for females and a subgroup plausibly spending most of their time at home suggest a relation between increased risk of HM death and residential proximity to the refinery.","['Micheli, Andrea', 'Meneghini, Elisabetta', 'Mariottini, Mauro', 'Baldini, Marco', 'Baili, Paolo', 'Di Salvo, Francesca', 'Sant, Milena']","['Micheli A', 'Meneghini E', 'Mariottini M', 'Baldini M', 'Baili P', 'Di Salvo F', 'Sant M']","['Epidemiologia Analitica e Impatto Sanitario, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Via Venezian 1, 20133, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141005,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Petroleum)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chemical Industry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Petroleum/toxicity', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/05 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2014/10/05 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-014-0468-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2014 Dec;25(12):1635-44. doi: 10.1007/s10552-014-0468-1.

METHODS: Data on dietary folate intake during the 6 months before the child's conception were collected from 285 case fathers and 595 control fathers using a dietary questionnaire. Nutrient intake was quantified using a customized computer software package based on Australian food composition databases. Data on folate intake were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for study-matching variables, total energy, and potentially confounding variables. In a subset of 229 cases and 420 controls, data on vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 intake were also analyzed. RESULTS: No consistent associations were seen with paternal dietary intake of folate or vitamin B6. Higher levels of paternal dietary vitamin B12 were appeared to be associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL, with those in the highest tertile of consumption having an OR of 1.51 (0.97, 2.36). The use of supplements containing folate and vitamins B6 or B12 was rare. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any biologically plausible evidence that paternal nutrition in the period leading up to conception was associated with childhood ALL. Our finding for vitamin B12 may be a chance finding, given the number of analyses performed, or be attributable to participation bias because parents with a tertiary education had the lowest level of B12 intake and tertiary education was more common among control than case parents.","['Bailey, Helen D', 'Miller, Margaret', 'Greenop, Kathryn R', 'Bower, Carol', 'Attia, John', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Bailey HD', 'Miller M', 'Greenop KR', 'Bower C', 'Attia J', 'Marshall GM', 'Armstrong BK', 'Milne E']","['Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372, Lyon Cedex 08, France, helenb@ichr.uwa.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141005,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', '8059-24-3 (Vitamin B 6)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diet', '*Dietary Supplements', '*Fathers', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vitamin B 12/administration & dosage', 'Vitamin B 6/administration & dosage', 'Vitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/10/05 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2014/10/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-014-0466-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2014 Dec;25(12):1615-25. doi: 10.1007/s10552-014-0466-3.

In this study, we investigate how CHK1 participates to proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing the mutated FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor. Pharmacological inhibition of CHK1 as well as its shRNA mediated down regulation reduced the proliferation rate of FLT-ITD expressing leukemic cell lines in a cytostatic manner. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no accumulation in a specific phase of the cell cycle upon CHK1 inhibition. Accordingly, lentiviral-mediated CHK1 overexpression increased the proliferation rate of FLT3-ITD expressing cells, as judged by cell viability and [3H] thymidine incorporation experiments. By contrast, expression of a ser280 mutant did not, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is an important determinant of CHK1 proliferative function. Clonogenic growth of primary leukemic cells from patients in semi-solid medium was reduced upon CHK1 inhibition, confirming the data obtained with leukemic established cell lines. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 CHK1 inhibitory compounds tested in this study were also potent inhibitors of the FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor. Altogether, these data identify CHK1 as a regulator of FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cells proliferation, and they open interesting perspectives in terms of new therapeutic strategies for these pathologies.","['Yuan, Ling Li', 'Green, Alexa', 'David, Laure', 'Dozier, Christine', 'Recher, Christian', 'Didier, Christine', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Manenti, Stephane']","['Yuan LL', 'Green A', 'David L', 'Dozier C', 'Recher C', 'Didier C', 'Tamburini J', 'Manenti S']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, CNRS Equipe de Recherche labellisee 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France; Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, PR China.', 'Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS UMR 8104, INSERM U 1016, Paris, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, CNRS Equipe de Recherche labellisee 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, CNRS Equipe de Recherche labellisee 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.', ""Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, CNRS Equipe de Recherche labellisee 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France; Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, CNRS Equipe de Recherche labellisee 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS UMR 8104, INSERM U 1016, Paris, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, CNRS Equipe de Recherche labellisee 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.

Little is known about mortality trends. OBJECTIVES: To count the number of deaths associated with angioedema in the United States, investigate correlations with age, sex, race, and other contributory causes, and analyze trends from 1979 to 2010. METHODS: All US death certificates in which angioedema was listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death during 1979 to 2010 were analyzed. Age-adjusted mortality rates were analyzed by age, sex, and race. Other conditions designated as the underlying cause of death were investigated. RESULTS: From 1979 to 2010, there were 5,758 deaths in which angioedema was listed as a contributing cause. The age-adjusted death rate for hereditary angioedema decreased from 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.32) to 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.08) per million persons per year. Conversely, mortality for angioedema increased from 0.24 (95% CI 0.21-0.27) to 0.34 (95% CI 0.31-0.37) per million. Blacks constituted 55% of angioedema deaths that were associated with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. On death certificates that listed hereditary angioedema as the underlying cause of death, cancer (frequently lymphoma or leukemia) was the second most commonly listed cause. CONCLUSION: Angioedema-associated deaths were very rare from 1979 to 2010. Hereditary angioedema deaths became even more so, whereas nonhereditary angioedema deaths increased. Risks associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were higher in blacks. Lack of specific coding for acquired angioedema most likely explains the observed association between cancer and hereditary angioedema.

In such patients, FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are only partially effective and do not eliminate the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are assumed to be the source of treatment failure. Here, we show that the NAD-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase is selectively overexpressed in primary human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs. This SIRT1 overexpression is related to enhanced expression of the USP22 deubiquitinase induced by c-MYC, leading to reduced SIRT1 ubiquitination and enhanced stability. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression or activity reduced the growth of FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and significantly enhanced TKI-mediated killing of the cells. Therefore, these results identify a c-MYC-related network that enhances SIRT1 protein expression in human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and contributes to their maintenance. Inhibition of this oncogenic network could be an attractive approach for targeting FLT3-ITD AML LSCs to improve treatment outcomes.","['Li, Ling', 'Osdal, Tereza', 'Ho, Yinwei', 'Chun, Sookhee', 'McDonald, Tinisha', 'Agarwal, Puneet', 'Lin, Allen', 'Chu, Su', 'Qi, Jing', 'Li, Liang', 'Hsieh, Yao-Te', 'Dos Santos, Cedric', 'Yuan, Hongfeng', 'Ha, Trung-Quang', 'Popa, Mihaela', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Chen, Wenyong', 'Lain, Sonia', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Li L', 'Osdal T', 'Ho Y', 'Chun S', 'McDonald T', 'Agarwal P', 'Lin A', 'Chu S', 'Qi J', 'Li L', 'Hsieh YT', 'Dos Santos C', 'Yuan H', 'Ha TQ', 'Popa M', 'Hovland R', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Kuo YH', 'Chen W', 'Lain S', 'McCormack E', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen 5021, Norway.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen 5021, Norway.', 'KinN Therapeutics AS, Bergen 5008, Norway.', 'Center for Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen 5021, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen 5021, Norway; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen 5021, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen 5021, Norway; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen 5021, Norway.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm 17177, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen 5021, Norway; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen 5021, Norway.

In this way, it has been possible to tune the plasmonic resonance spectral position close to the excitation wavelength of the monochromatic laser light source in order to maximize the enhancing properties of the substrate. Samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and reflectance measurements and tested for SERS activity using malachite green. Besides, as the developed substrate had been prepared on a simple glass slide, SERS detection from the support side is also demonstrated. The optimized substrate is functionalized with thiol-modified capture oligonucleotides, and concentration-dependent signal of the target nucleotide is detected in a sandwich assay with labeled gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles functionalized with different DNA and various Raman reporters are applied in a microarray-based assay recognizing a disease biomarker (Wilms tumor gene) and housekeeping gene expressions in the same time on spatially separated microspots.

Furthermore, p53 phosphorylation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were examined to elucidate the mechanism of cell death induction. Both complexes exhibited a significant dose-dependent antigrowth effect in vitro. The complexes predominately induced apoptosis, but necrosis was also observed.

To obtain new insights into the function of the IL-4 pathway in CLL, we analyzed the gene expression response to IL-4 in CLL and in normal B cells (NBC) by oligonucleotide microarrays, resulting in the identification of 232 non-redundant entities in CLL and 146 in NBC (95 common, 283 altogether), of which 189 were well-defined genes in CLL and 123 in NBC (83 common, 229 altogether) (p<0.05, 2-fold cut-off). To the best of our knowledge, most of them were novel IL-4 targets for CLL (98%), B cells of any source (83%), or any cell type (70%). Responses were significantly higher for 54 and 11 genes in CLL and NBC compared to each other, respectively. In CLL, ZAP-70 status had an impact on IL-4 response, since different sets of IL-4 targets correlated positively or negatively with baseline expression of ZAP-70. In addition, the NFkappaB inhibitor 6-Amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenethylamino)quinazoline, which reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-4, preferentially blocked the response of genes positively correlated with ZAP-70 (e.g. CCR2, SUSD2), but enhanced the response of genes negatively correlated with ZAP-70 (e.g. AUH, BCL6, LY75, NFIL3). Dissection of the gene expression response to IL-4 in CLL and NBC contributes to the understanding of the anti-apoptotic response. Initial evidence of a connection between ZAP-70 and NFkappaB supports further exploration of targeting NFkappaB in the context of the assessment of inhibition of the IL-4 pathway as a therapeutic strategy in CLL, especially in patients expressing bad prognostic markers.","['Ruiz-Lafuente, Natalia', 'Alcaraz-Garcia, Maria-Jose', 'Sebastian-Ruiz, Silvia', 'Gomez-Espuch, Joaquin', 'Funes, Consuelo', 'Moraleda, Jose-Maria', 'Garcia-Garay, Maria-Carmen', 'Montes-Barqueros, Natividad', 'Minguela, Alfredo', 'Alvarez-Lopez, Maria-Rocio', 'Parrado, Antonio']","['Ruiz-Lafuente N', 'Alcaraz-Garcia MJ', 'Sebastian-Ruiz S', 'Gomez-Espuch J', 'Funes C', 'Moraleda JM', 'Garcia-Garay MC', 'Montes-Barqueros N', 'Minguela A', 'Alvarez-Lopez MR', 'Parrado A']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital General Universitario Santa Lucia, Cartagena, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de enfermedades hepaticas y digestivas, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de enfermedades hepaticas y digestivas, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de la Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics']",,,2014/10/04 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109533 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-26451 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 3;9(10):e109533. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109533. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4184842,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched to May 2014 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effect of early treatment over deferred treatment. Primary outcome measure was mortality, and secondary outcome measures were progression, response rate, and adverse events. RESULTS: Overall, 5 trials including 449 patients were identified. There was a markedly reduced risk of disease progression with early treatment (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07 to 0.24). There were no significant differences in mortality and response rate (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.60, and OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.23, respectively). More patients in the early treatment arm experienced gastrointestinal toxicities (OR = 10.02, 95%CI = 4.32 to 23.23), constipation (OR = 8.58, 95%CI = 3.20 to 23.00) and fatigue or asthenia (OR = 2.72, 95%CI = 1.30 to 5.67). No significant differences were seen with the development of acute leukemia (OR = 2.80, 95%CI = 0.42 to 18.81), hematologic cancer (OR = 2.07, 95%CI = 0.43 to 10.01), second primary tumors (OR = 3.45, 95%CI = 0.81 to 14.68), nor vertebral compression (OR = 0.18, 95%CI = 0.02 to 1.59). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment delayed disease progression but increased the risk of gastrointestinal toxicities, constipation and fatigue or asthenia. The differences on vertebral compression, acute leukemia, hematological cancer and second primary tumors were not statistically significant. Based on the current evidence, early treatment didn't significantly affect mortality and response rate. However, further much larger trials were needed to provide more evidence.","['Gao, Minjie', 'Yang, Guang', 'Tompkins, Van S', 'Gao, Lu', 'Wu, Xiaosong', 'Tao, Yi', 'Hu, Xiaojing', 'Hou, Jun', 'Han, Ying', 'Xu, Hongwei', 'Zhan, Fenghuang', 'Shi, Jumei']","['Gao M', 'Yang G', 'Tompkins VS', 'Gao L', 'Wu X', 'Tao Y', 'Hu X', 'Hou J', 'Han Y', 'Xu H', 'Zhan F', 'Shi J']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Time Factors']",,,2014/10/04 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109758 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-16107 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 3;9(10):e109758. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109758. eCollection 2014.,,['T32 HL007344/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4184905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, 7 genes were selected from our previous study, which encoded interleukin 32 (IL-32), lysosomal H(+) transporting ATPase, V0 subunit d2 (ATP6V0D2), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 9 (TNFRSF9), amphiregulin, schwannoma-derived growth factor (AREG), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ErbB3), PRR5-ARHGAP8 (LOC553158) and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH), and their expression was examined in human clinical specimens from patients with cancer. In addition, the expression of the gene encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was examined. The specimens from patients with colon, stomach and renal cancer showed increased MnSOD, IL-32, and TNFRSF9 transcripts compared to those from non-tumorous regions of the same patients. Notably, an elevated expression of ATP6V0D2 was found in the specimens from patients with stomach cancer, whereas the expression was decreased in those from patients with colon and renal cancer. The expression of LOC553158 was upregulated in colon and stomach cancer specimens. These results indicate that the investigation of gene expression under acidic conditions is useful for the development of novel cancer markers and/or chemotherapeutic targets.","['Fukamachi, Toshihiko', 'Ikeda, Shunsuke', 'Saito, Hiromi', 'Tagawa, Masatoshi', 'Kobayashi, Hiroshi']","['Fukamachi T', 'Ikeda S', 'Saito H', 'Tagawa M', 'Kobayashi H']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology and Cell Therapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8717, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140711,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acidic environments', 'gene expression', 'human cancer']",2014/10/04 06:00,2014/10/04 06:01,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2014.344 [doi]', 'mco-02-06-1160 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2014 Nov;2(6):1160-1166. doi: 10.3892/mco.2014.344.

Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities play an important role in diagnosis, classification and prognosis of AML. However, several chromosomal abnormalities have not been completely determined or characterized, primarily because of their low incidence and limited amount of data. RESULTS: We characterized an AML patient with a novel apparently balanced insertion ins(18;5)(q21;q31.2q35.1) that was cryptic by G-banding. The rearrangement was further examined by molecular cytogenetic methods and oligobased high-resolution array CGH (oaCGH) analysis. We show that an approximately 31.8 Mb large segment from chromosome 5 bands q31.2 to q35.1 has been inserted, by a direct mechanism, into chromosome 18 between bands q12.3 and q21.1. The insertion was unbalanced with concurrent submicroscopic deletions at 5q31.2 (approximately 0.37 Mb in size), 5q35.1q35.2 (approximately 1.98 Mb in size), and 18q12.3q21.1 (approximately 2.07 Mb in size). The microdeletions affect genes on 5q and 18q that have been associated with hematological malignancy and other cancers. A novel juxtaposition of the genes NPM1 and HAUS1 at 5q35.1 and 18q21.1, respectively, was detected by FISH analysis. Searching the literature and the Mitelman database revealed no previously reported ins(18;5) cases. Interestingly, however, two AML patients with translocation t(5;18)(q35;q21) encompassing the 5q35 and 18q21 breakpoint regions as detected in our present ins(18;5) patient have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: It is well-known that cytogenetic abnormalities on the long arm of chromosome 5 affect hematopoiesis. However, the precise mechanism of their involvement in myeloid transformation is elusive. Our present data shed new light onto the frequent abnormalities on 5q as well as to the less frequent abnormalities observed on 18q in myeloid malignancies. In addition, we show that oaCGH analysis is a useful adjunct to revealing submicroscopic aberrations in regions of clinical importance. Reporting rare and nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities contribute to the identification of the whole spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML and their prognostic significance.","['Kjeldsen, Eigil']",['Kjeldsen E'],"['Department of Hematology, HemoDiagnostic Laboratory, Cancer Cytogenetics Section, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, Ent. 4A, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140925,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chromosomal insertion', 'Cryptic chromosomal aberration', 'Microdeletion', 'add(18q)', 'del(5q)', 'ins(18;5)', 'oaCGH analysis']",2014/10/04 06:00,2014/10/04 06:01,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-014-0063-x [doi]', '63 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2014 Sep 25;7(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s13039-014-0063-x. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4180307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Health Organization has defined the criteria for diagnosis, but it is still unclear which parameter (hemoglobin or hematocrit) is the most reliable for demonstrating increased red cell volume and for monitoring response to therapy; also, the role of bone marrow biopsy is being revisited. PV is associated with reduced survival because of cardiovascular complications and progression to post-PV myelofibrosis or leukemia. Criteria for risk-adapted treatment rely on the likelihood of thrombosis. Controlled trials have demonstrated that incidence of cardiovascular events is reduced by sustained control of hematocrit with phlebotomies (low-risk patients) and/or cytotoxic agents (high-risk patients) and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. Hydroxyurea and interferon may be used as first-line treatments, whereas busulfan is reserved for patients that are refractory or resistant to first-line agents. However, there is no evidence that therapy improves survival, and the significance of reduction of JAK2 mutated allele burden produced by interferon is unknown. PV is also associated with a plethora of symptoms that are poorly controlled by conventional therapy.

Three-year estimates of overall survival were 65% (95% confidence interval [CI] 56% to 73%), 56% (95% CI, 43% to 67%), and 23% (95% CI, 6% to 46%) for patients requiring 1 course, 2 courses, or >2 courses of induction therapy; corresponding relapse estimates were 24% (95% CI, 17% to 31%), 43% (95% CI, 31% to 55%), and 58% (95% CI, 30% to 78%), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of adherence, persistence, and discontinuation of 2 oral second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), dasatinib and nilotinib, in CML patients during their first 12 months of second-line treatment. METHODS: Adult CML patients (ICD-9-CM: 205.1x) with 2 consecutive dasatinib or nilotinib prescription claims within 12 months were identified from the Truven Health MarketScan Databases (January 1, 2006-September 30, 2011). Patients were excluded if they had FDA-approved non-CML indications for imatinib, had less than 6 months continuous enrollment, or had a stem cell/bone marrow transplant in the 6 months pre-index. Patients were followed until the first occurrence of index TKI discontinuation/switch; enrollment end; December 31, 2011; or 12 months follow-up post-index. Index treatment (dasatinib </= 100 mg or nilotinib) was categorized as second-line if there was evidence of only 1 alternative TKI exposure (e.g., imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) anytime during the patient's available claims history. When comparing adherence, persistence, and discontinuation, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used. Adherence and persistence measures were calculated as specified by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Medication Compliance and Persistence Special Interest Group. Treatment adherence was calculated using medication possession ratio (MPR) and was reported as both continuous and binary measures (i.e., high adherence = MPR >/= 85%). Persistence was reported as the proportion of days covered (PDC) and estimated level of persistence (ELPT). Finally, discontinuation was defined as a treatment gap of greater than 90 days and absence of index TKI during the remainder of the follow-up period. Time to discontinuation and high adherence of index TKI were compared using weighted Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models, respectively. RESULTS: After propensity weighting, the 219 second-line dasatinib patients and the 158 second-line nilotinib patients were similar in mean age, gender, cancer complexity, and comorbidity burden at baseline. Age as a categorical measure, population density, and index year remained imbalanced and were, therefore, included as covariates in the multivariate analysis of adherence. In the bivariate analyses, mean MPR (88.2% vs. 84.4%, P = 0.036); proportion of patients with high adherence (72.7% vs. 63.3%, P = 0.006); and ELPT (70.4% vs. 62.7%, P = 0.026) were significantly higher among dasatinib patients than nilotinib patients. Mean PDC was not significantly different between dasatinib and nilotinib patients (0.79 vs. 0.77, P = 0.328) after propensity weighting. In addition, a significantly lower proportion of second-line dasatinib patients discontinued their index therapy compared with second-line nilotinib patients (4.4% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.020). With a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.27-0.93, P = 0.029), dasatinib patients had half the possibility of discontinuing treatment compared with nilotinib patients at any point in time. After accounting for the baseline factors remaining imbalanced and controlling for cancer complexity and number of concomitant medications at baseline, second-line dasatinib patients were 1.7 times (95% CI = 1.2-2.4) more likely to be highly adherent than second-line nilotinib patients (P = 0.0016). CONCLUSIONS: Among second-line TKI-treated CML patients, dasatinib patients had significantly higher adherence and lower discontinuation rates compared with patients receiving second-line nilotinib.","['Trivedi, Digisha', 'Landsman-Blumberg, Pamela', 'Darkow, Theodore', 'Smith, David', 'McMorrow, Donna', 'Mullins, C Daniel']","['Trivedi D', 'Landsman-Blumberg P', 'Darkow T', 'Smith D', 'McMorrow D', 'Mullins CD']","['Outcomes Research Strategies, LLC, 16 Talbot Farm Rd., Norwood MA 02062, USA. digisha@outcomesresearchstrategy.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,101644425,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dasatinib', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/04 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['2014(20)10: 1006-1015 [pii]', '10.18553/jmcp.2014.20.10.1006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Manag Care Spec Pharm. 2014 Oct;20(10):1006-15. doi: 10.18553/jmcp.2014.20.10.1006.,,,,,,,,"['J Manag Care Spec Pharm. 2015 Nov;21(11):1089', 'J Manag Care Spec Pharm. 2015 Nov;21(11):1088.

CSL360 is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD123 (IL-3 receptor alpha-subchain) expressed in the absence of CD131 (beta-subchain), an epitope that is displayed by leukemia stem cells (LSCs). We are studying CSL360 modified with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for complexing 111In and 13-mer nuclear translocation sequence (NLS) peptides to enable nuclear importation in LSCs for Auger electron radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of AML. We demonstrate that microSPECT/CT imaging using 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 revealed engraftment of primary human AML specimens into the BM and spleen of NOD/SCID mice. Our results suggest that microSPECT/CT imaging is a powerful tool which enables non-invasive assessment of the engraftment of AML into NOD/SCID mice and in the current study specifically probes an epitope displayed by the LSC subpopulation. The targeting of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 to sites of AML engraftment in the NOD/SCID mouse model is encouraging for future RIT studies. Ultimately, SPECT imaging could be applied in AML patients to assess the delivery of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 to sites of leukemia and be combined with Auger electron RIT using the same agent targeting the LSC population as a ""theranostic"" pair.","['Leyton, Jeffrey V', 'Williams, Brent', 'Gao, Catherine', 'Keating, Armand', 'Minden, Mark', 'Reilly, Raymond M']","['Leyton JV', 'Williams B', 'Gao C', 'Keating A', 'Minden M', 'Reilly RM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Hematology/Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Furthermore, we examined the HLA association according to morphological, cytogenetic, immunological, and clinical classifications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed HLA genotyping, bone marrow studies, cytogenetic analyses, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. A clinical outcome database was constructed, and the HLA frequency, gene frequency, relative risk (RR), linkage disequilibrium, and the 2-locus and 3-locus haplotype frequency using the Mattiuz formula were calculated. For the healthy controls, Korean HLA data published by Park and co-workers were used. RESULTS: AML was found to be associated with HLA-C3 (RR = 1.46; p < 0.001). In the French-American-British (FAB) classification, acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) was associated with HLA-C3 (47.2 vs. 74.1%; RR = 3.13; p = 0.005), in cytogenetic classification, del(9), which is frequently observed in AML-M4, was also associated with HLA-C3 (47.2 vs. 100%; RR = 13.43; p = 0.024), and in clinical classification, incomplete remission was associated with HLA-C3 as well (47.2 vs. 63.2%; RR = 1.92; p = 0.002). No correlations between AML and immunological classifications were observed. Moreover, and in terms of 2-locus haplotypes, AML was found to be associated with HLA-C3/B62 (HLA-C3 gene frequency 0.3415; HLA-B62 gene frequency 0.1361; linkage disequilibrium 0.0136; haplotype frequency 4.15 vs. 6.0%; p < 0.05). In clinical classification, incomplete remission (linkage disequilibrium 0.0136; haplotype frequency 4.15 vs. 13.6%; p = 0.013) and relapse (linkage disequilibrium 0.0136; haplotype frequency 4.15 vs. 71.0%; p = 0.044) were associated with HLA-C3/B62, whereas no association was observed for FAB, cytogenetic and immunological classifications.

Chronic viral antigenic stimulation induces persistent infection which results in a clinically asymptomatic carrier state. Only a minor proportion of infected individuals develop adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic myelopathy (HAM/TSP). This is dependent on a balance of host and genetic factors. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte function is important in the immune response against viral infection; however, the contribution of CD160 receptor associated with CD8+ T lymphocytes is unclear. Thus, we sought to decipher its role on CTL function in HTLV-1 infection. Here, we report high frequencies of CD160 on CD8+ T cells, with significantly higher levels on HTLV-1 specific CD8+ T cells. Intercepting the CD160 pathway via blockade of the receptor or its ligand, herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) resulted in improved perforin production and CD107a degranulation of HTLV-1 specific CD8+ T cells. Analysis of the CD160-expressing CD8+ cells demonstrated a unique subset associated with a highly differentiated effector memory based on CD45RA and CCR7 co-expression, increased expression of inhibitory molecules, 2B4 and PD1. Altogether, these results suggest a role for CD160/HVEM pathway in regulating immune response against HTLV-1 infection which may prove promising in the development of immune therapies for the treatment of HTLV-1 infection and other associated disorders.","['Chibueze, Chioma Ezinne', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Arima, Naomichi']","['Chibueze CE', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Arima N']","['Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.

Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-beta). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection. To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-gamma, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1beta, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-gamma. Silencing of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression. To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner. Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.","['Foronjy, Robert F', 'Dabo, Abdoulaye J', 'Cummins, Neville', 'Geraghty, Patrick']","['Foronjy RF', 'Dabo AJ', 'Cummins N', 'Geraghty P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141003,England,BMC Immunol,BMC immunology,100966980,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IPS-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (TICAM-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/deficiency/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Lung/*pathology/*virology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Protective Agents/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/*physiology', 'Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism']",,,2014/10/04 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['s12865-014-0041-4 [pii]', '10.1186/s12865-014-0041-4 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Immunol. 2014 Oct 3;15:41. doi: 10.1186/s12865-014-0041-4.,,"['R01 HL098528/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01HL098528-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4189665,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened 42,443 patients hospitalized for blood diseases in France in 2009 and 2010 and determined which patients had received more than 20 PRC. Among them, we selected those having at least one measure of serum ferritin, and subsequently those which ferritin was greater than or equal to 1000 ng/mL. RESULTS: Three thousand eight hundred and twelve patients (9%) received more than 20 PRC, 1935 (4.5%) had a ferritin assay, which was increased in 1216 patients (2.9%). Eight hundred and eighty-one patients underwent an hemovigilance report form. Forty-nine percent had low-risk myelodysplasia or acute leukemia, 7% hemoglobinopathies. Hemosiderosis was asymptomatic for 680 patients (77%), serious 188 (88%) and life-threatening for 11 (1%). Two patients died of terminal heart failure. The most severe hemosiderosis (>/= grade 2) were low-risk myelodysplasia and idiopathic aplastic anemia. Ninety-two percent of thalassemia patients and 46% of sickle cell anemia patients received an iron chelator. For low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and idiopathic aplastic anemia, 228 of the 317 patients whose treatment is known and who could benefit from iron chelation (72%) have not received it. CONCLUSION: These results encourage seeking optimal transmission of information (over 20 CGR) to the clinician, and prolonging hemovigilance action towards a more comprehensive statement of post-transfusion hemochromatosis.","['Leo-Kodeli, S', 'Renaudier, P', 'Lassale, B']","['Leo-Kodeli S', 'Renaudier P', 'Lassale B']","[""Unite de securite transfusionnelle et d'hemovigilance, centre hospitalier regional d'Orleans, hopital de la Source, 14, avenue de l'Hopital, 45067 Orleans cedex 2, France.

In this two-part series, we review each of these aspects of MRD in MM. In part 1, we review different methodologies available for MRD assessment, with an emphasis on multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and duplex immunohistochemistry. There is currently a strong push in the MM community for the use of MFC, based on studies demonstrating MRD negativity by MFC being associated with delayed time to relapse. After participating in a recent international meeting of leaders in the field, convened to discuss this topic, we review and assess the voiced opinions and published data. While great strides have been made toward the standardization of MFC for MRD, we review not only intrinsic biologic differences between MM and leukemia but also the technical challenges that follow from these differences, including the need for live cells, a difficult to characterize immunophenotype, and significant interlaboratory variability in MFC testing and interpretation.","['Ely, Scott', 'Biran, Noa', 'Chari, Ajai']","['Ely S', 'Biran N', 'Chari A']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 525 East 68th Street, Starr Pavilion, 715, New York, NY, 10065, USA, sae2001@med.cornell.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology/*therapy']",,,2014/10/04 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/10/04 06:00'],"['2014/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-014-0238-x [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2014 Dec;9(4):379-88. doi: 10.1007/s11899-014-0238-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cultures were from Yakult, Bear Brand Probiotic Drink, Nido3+ Powdered Milk. Filter-sterilized supernatants from cultures of Lactobacillus spp. were evaluated for cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells (HT-29 and HCT116), leukemia cells (THP-1), and normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFn) using PrestoBlue. Bleomycin was the positive control. Absolute quantification of transcript levels was conducted using qRT-PCR. Cytotoxicity index profiles on HDFn, THP-1 of all probiotic supernatants and negative controls suggest nontoxicity to the cells when compared to bleomycin, whereas all probiotic supernatants were found to be cytotoxic to HT-29 and HCT-116 colon cancer cell lines. Expression of cfos, cjun transcripts was significantly upregulated in HT-29 and HCT116 cells treated with probiotic supernatants compared to untreated baseline levels (P < 0.05). Expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha by lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages was significantly downregulated in cells with probiotic supernatants compared to those exposed to MRS medium (P < 0.05).

Myeloid sarcoma is an extramedullary neoplasm of immature myeloid cells. Our study reports a presentation of myeloid sarcoma which presented with severe leukemoid reaction as a secondary malignancy in a patient who was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia previously. The case emphasizes the difficulties in diagnosis of patients who do not have concomitant leukemia. Case Presentation. A 6-year-old girl who was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia previously presented with fatigue, paleness, and hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspirate examination did not demonstrate any blasts in spite of severe leukemoid reaction with a white cell count 158000/mm(3). FDG/PET CT revealed slight uptake in cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Excisional lymph node biopsy was performed from these lymph nodes and it showed myeloid sarcoma. Conclusion. Myeloid sarcoma can develop as a secondary malignancy in children who are treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It can be associated with severe leukemoid reaction and diagnosis may be difficult if there is not concomitant leukemia. PET/CT is helpful in such cases.","['Canbolat Ayhan, Aylin', 'Timur, Cetin', 'Sonmez, Seyma', 'Zemheri, Ebru', 'Yoruk, Asim']","['Canbolat Ayhan A', 'Timur C', 'Sonmez S', 'Zemheri E', 'Yoruk A']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, 34724 Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, 34724 Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, 34724 Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pathology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, 34724 Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, 34724 Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140903,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,,2014/10/03 06:00,2014/10/03 06:01,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/757625 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2014;2014:757625. doi: 10.1155/2014/757625.

TET2 catalyses the conversion of 5'-methylcytosine to 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine within DNA and has been implicated in the process of genomic demethylation. However, the mechanism by which TET2 loss of function results in hematopoietic dysplasia and leukemogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that TET2 is expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and that its knockdown results in reduction of 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine in genomic DNA. We also present DNA methylation data from bone marrow samples obtained from patients with TET2-mutated myelodysplasia. Based on these findings, we sought to identify the role of TET2 in regulating pluripotency and differentiation. We show that overexpression of TET2 in a stably integrated transgene leads to increased alkaline phosphatase expression in differentiating ES cells and impaired differentiation in methylcellulose culture. We speculate that this effect is due to TET2-mediated expression of stem cell genes in ES cells via hydroxylation of 5'-methylcytosines at key promoter sequences within genomic DNA. This leads to relative hypomethylation of gene promoters as 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine is not a substrate for DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation. We sought to test this hypothesis by cotransfecting the TET2 gene with methylated reporter genes. The results of these experiments are presented.","['Norman, Louis', 'Tarrant, Paul', 'Chevassut, Timothy']","['Norman L', 'Tarrant P', 'Chevassut T']","['Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Sussex University, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, UK.', 'Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Sussex University, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, UK.', 'Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Sussex University, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, UK ; Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Brighton BN2 5BE, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140825,Egypt,Bone Marrow Res,Bone marrow research,101566202,,,,,,2014/10/03 06:00,2014/10/03 06:01,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/986571 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Res. 2014;2014:986571. doi: 10.1155/2014/986571.

Despite this, its presence in the bladder warrants continued surveillance, as recurrence and progression to other bladder malignancies are possible. We present a 71-year-old woman initially diagnosed with CLL who was plagued by recurrent hematuria and dysuria for over a decade, which lead to multiple negative urologic workups. However, these continued workups eventually lead to her diagnosis of bladder CLL with a subsequent finding of carcinoma in situ that was prompted by a suspicious surveillance cystoscopy performed 4 months after her initial bladder diagnosis.

Ads has been implicated in cellular secretion, exocytosis and has also been shown to regulate chondrogenesis and megakaryoblastic leukemia cell differentiation. Here we report for the first time that Ads is involved in regulating osteoclastogenesis (OCG). Ads is induced during OCG downstream of RANK-ligand (RANKL) stimulation and is highly expressed in mature osteoclasts. The D5 isoform of Ads is not involved in regulating OCG, as its expression is not induced in response to RANKL. Three clonal Ads knockdown RAW264.7 (RAW) macrophage cell lines with varying degrees of Ads expression and OCG deficiency were generated. The most drastic OCG defect was noted in the clonal cell line with the greatest degree of Ads knockdown as indicated by a lack of TRAcP staining and multinucleation. RNAi mediated knockdown of Ads in osteoclast precursors resulted in distinct morphological changes characterized by altered F-actin distribution and increased filopodia formation. Ads knockdown precursor cells experienced enhanced migration while fusion of knockdown precursors cells was limited. Transient reintroduction of de novo Ads back into the knockdown system was capable of rescuing TRAcP expression but not osteoclast multinucleation most likely due to the transient nature of Ads expression. This preliminary study allows us to conclude that Ads is a RANKL induced early regulator of OCG with a potential role in pre-osteoclast differentiation and fusion.","['Hassanpour, Siavash', 'Jiang, Hongwei', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Kuiper, Johannes W P', 'Glogauer, Michael']","['Hassanpour S', 'Jiang H', 'Wang Y', 'Kuiper JW', 'Glogauer M']","['Matrix Dynamics Group, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Matrix Dynamics Group, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Operative Dentistry and Endodontics, Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, P.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib has been shown to be effective at induce apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia through inhibition of Syk. In this study, we sought to test the efficacy of gefitinib in primary human ZAP-70+ CLL cells. We demonstrate that gefitinib preferentially induces cell death in ZAP-70-expressing CLL cells with a median IC50 of 4.5 muM. In addition, gefitinib decreases the viability of ZAP-70+ Jurkat T leukemia cells but fails to affect T cells from CLL patients. Western blot analysis shows gefitinib reduces both basal and B-cell receptor (BCR)-stimulated phosphorylation of Syk/ZAP-70, ERK, and Akt in ZAP-70+ CLL cells. Moreover, gefitinib inhibits the pro-survival response from BCR stimulation and decreases pro-survival proteins such as Mcl-1. Finally, ZAP-70 expression sensitizes Raji cells to gefitinib treatment. These results demonstrate that gefitinib specifically targets ZAP-70+ CLL cells and inhibits the BCR cell survival pathway leading to apoptosis. This represents the likelihood of tyrosine kinase inhibitors being effective targeted treatments for ZAP-70+ CLL cells.","['Dielschneider, R F', 'Xiao, W', 'Yoon, J-Y', 'Noh, E', 'Banerji, V', 'Li, H', 'Marshall, A J', 'Johnston, J B', 'Gibson, S B']","['Dielschneider RF', 'Xiao W', 'Yoon JY', 'Noh E', 'Banerji V', 'Li H', 'Marshall AJ', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['1] Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [2] Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', '1] Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [2] Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', '1] Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [2] Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [3] Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', '1] Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [2] Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', '1] Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [2] Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [3] Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada [4] Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014391 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.391 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 2;5:e1439. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.391.,,,PMC4649506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two processes are disrupted during leukemogenesis, resulting in differentiation block and uncontrolled proliferation in leukemia. To understand the mechanisms disrupting the coordination between the two processes in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), we investigated the regulatory mechanism of the negative cell cycle regulator CDKN2D by the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein and the role of CDKN2D in cell differentiation and proliferation. We found that CDKN2D expression in APL cells was significantly lower than that in normal promyelocytes. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays, we showed that PML/RARalpha directly bound to and inhibited the transactivation of the CDKN2D promoter. Further evidence by the truncated and mutated CDKN2D promoters revealed that the everted repeat 8 (ER8) motif on the promoter was the binding site of PML/RARalpha. Forced expression of CDKN2D induced G0/G1 phase arrest and partial granulocytic differentiation in APL-derived NB4 cells, suggesting the function of CDKN2D in regulating both cell proliferation and granulocytic differentiation. Furthermore, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly induced CDKN2D expression in APL cells and knockdown of CDKN2D expression during ATRA treatment partially blocked the ATRA-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Collectively, our data indicate that CDKN2D repression by PML/RARalpha disrupts both cell proliferation and differentiation in the pathogenesis of APL, and induced expression of CDKN2D by ATRA alleviates the disruption of both processes to ensure treatment efficiency. This study provides a mechanism for coupling proliferation and differentiation in leukemic cells through the action of CDKN2D.","['Wang, Y', 'Jin, W', 'Jia, X', 'Luo, R', 'Tan, Y', 'Zhu, X', 'Yang, X', 'Wang, X', 'Wang, K']","['Wang Y', 'Jin W', 'Jia X', 'Luo R', 'Tan Y', 'Zhu X', 'Yang X', 'Wang X', 'Wang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', '1] State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China [2] Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200025, China [3] Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'School of Life Sciences/Center for Computational Systems Biology, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', '1] State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China [2] Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200025, China [3] Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (CDKN2D protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014388 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.388 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Oct 2;5:e1431. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.388.,,,PMC4649503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As members of the GST family are relevant allergens in mites, cockroach and fungi we investigated the allergenic relevance of GST from birch (bGST). METHODOLOGY: bGST was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. Sera from 217 birch pollen-allergic patients were tested for IgE-reactivity to bGST by ELISA. The mediator-releasing activity of bGST was analysed with IgE-loaded rat basophil leukaemia cells (RBL) expressing human FcepsilonRI. BALB/c mice were immunized with bGST or Bet v 1. Antibody and T cell responses to either protein were assessed. IgE-cross-reactivity between bGST with GST from house dust mite, Der p 8, was studied with murine and human sera in ELISA. The release kinetics of bGST and Bet v 1 from birch pollen were assessed in water, simulated lung fluid, 0.9% NaCl and PBS. Eluted proteins were quantified by ELISA and analysed by immunoblotting. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Only 13% of 217 birch pollen-allergic patients showed IgE-reactivity to bGST. In RBL assays bGST induced mediator release. Immunization of mice with bGST induced specific IgE and a Th2-dominated cellular immune response comparably to immunization with Bet v 1. bGST did not cross-react with Der p 8. In contrast to Bet v 1, only low amounts of bGST were released from pollen grains upon incubation in water and the different physiological solutions. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Although bGST is abundant in birch pollen, immunogenic in mice and able to induce mediator release from effector cells passively loaded with specific IgE, it is a minor allergen for birch pollen-allergic patients. We refer this discrepancy to its limited release from hydrated pollen. Hence, bGST is an example demonstrating that allergenicity depends mainly on rapid elution from airborne particles.","['Deifl, Stephan', 'Zwicker, Christian', 'Vejvar, Eva', 'Kitzmuller, Claudia', 'Gadermaier, Gabriele', 'Nagl, Birgit', 'Vrtala, Susanne', 'Briza, Peter', 'Zlabinger, Gerhard J', 'Jahn-Schmid, Beatrice', 'Ferreira, Fatima', 'Bohle, Barbara']","['Deifl S', 'Zwicker C', 'Vejvar E', 'Kitzmuller C', 'Gadermaier G', 'Nagl B', 'Vrtala S', 'Briza P', 'Zlabinger GJ', 'Jahn-Schmid B', 'Ferreira F', 'Bohle B']","['Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Allergy Diagnosis and Therapy, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Allergy Diagnosis and Therapy, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Allergy Diagnosis and Therapy, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Allergens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/immunology', 'Betula/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/chemistry/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Kinetics', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pollen/*immunology', 'Pyroglyphidae/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/immunology', 'Water/*chemistry']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109075 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-12217 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 2;9(9):e109075. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109075. eCollection 2014.,,['F 4602/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC4183528,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To persist at inflammatory sites, neutrophils require inhibition of their rapid and constitutive apoptosis, an inhibitory effect that phlogogenic cytokines support. To date, the effects of IL-32gamma on neutrophils remain unknown. We demonstrate that IL-32gamma delays, in a dose-dependent manner, the spontaneous apoptosis of human blood neutrophils by activating mainly p38 MAPK through rapid p38 phosphorylation. PI3-K and ERK1/2 MAPK are also involved, but to a lesser extent. Most of cytokines that induce retardation of neutrophil apoptosis activate the expression of MCL-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. IL-32gamma added to human blood neutrophils in vitro is associated with sustained levels of MCL-1 protein. This effect in neutrophils corresponds to a decrease of MCL-1 protein degradation without any effect on MCL-1 mRNA levels. The sustained levels of MCL-1 induced by IL-32gamma are only abrogated by the p38beta MAPK inhibitor SB202190. Additionally, IL-32gamma induces a reduction in caspase 3 activity in neutrophils. In conclusion, IL-32gamma affects human blood neutrophils in vitro by increasing their survival, suggesting that this cytokine could have profound effects on the deleterious functions of neutrophils in several diseases.","['Allaeys, Isabelle', 'Gymninova, Irina', 'Canet-Jourdan, Charlotte', 'Poubelle, Patrice E']","['Allaeys I', 'Gymninova I', 'Canet-Jourdan C', 'Poubelle PE']","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie et Immunologie (CRRI), Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec, Departement de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie et Immunologie (CRRI), Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec, Departement de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie et Immunologie (CRRI), Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec, Departement de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie et Immunologie (CRRI), Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec, Departement de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*immunology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/immunology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*immunology']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0109256 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-23274 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Oct 2;9(10):e109256. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109256. eCollection 2014.,,['MOP-208613/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC4183585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding of GO to the CD33 antigen on leukemic cells results in internalization and subsequent release of calicheamicin, thereby inducing DNA strand breaks. We hypothesized that the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib might inhibit DNA repair initiated by GO-induced DNA strand breaks, thereby increasing cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 and a GO-resistant variant (HL/GO20) were used. RESULTS: The 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 24 ng/ml for HL-60 cells and 550 ng/ml for GO-resistant variant HL/GO20 cells. HL/GO20 cells were also refractory to GO-induced apoptosis. CD33 positivity was reduced in HL/GO20 cells. Olaparib-alone did not inhibit the cell growth and did not induce apoptosis in either HL-60 cells or HL/GO20 cells at concentrations of up to 10 muM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The potential of combining the Bcl-2 homology 3 mimetic ABT-737, which blocks Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, with either the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) to inhibit the growth of human T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-1) infected T-cell lines and its mechanism was further evaluated. RESULTS: ABT-737 synergistically induced apoptosis when combined with either bortezomib or SAHA in HTLV-1 infected T-cell lines and fresh ATL cells. Bortezomib increased the expression of Noxa, which subsequently enhanced the formation of Mcl-1-Noxa complexes, resulting in the functional neutralization of Mcl-1, an inducer of resistance to ABT-737. On the other hand, SAHA reduced the expression of survivin, an anti-apoptotic molecule that confers drug resistance on ATL cells. CONCLUSION: The combination of ABT-737 with bortezomib or SAHA is promising for the treatment of ATL.","['Kunami, Naoko', 'Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Nogami, Rumiko', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Tamura, Kazuo']","['Kunami N', 'Katsuya H', 'Nogami R', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Tamura K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Fukuoka University, Jonan, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Fukuoka University, Jonan, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Fukuoka University, Jonan, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Fukuoka University, Jonan, Fukuoka, Japan kenjiishitsuka@fukuoka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Fukuoka University, Jonan, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Bcl-2 family protein', 'bortezomib', 'suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid']",2014/10/03 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['34/10/5287 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Oct;34(10):5287-94.,"['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ALV-J infections associated with hemangiomas have occurred in egg-producing (layer) flocks in China. In this study, we identified an ALV-J layer isolate (HLJ13SH01) as a recombinant of ALV-J and a Rous sarcoma virus Schmidt-Ruppin B strain (RSV-SRB), which contained the RSV-SRB 5'-LTR and the other genes of ALV-J. Replication kinetic testing indicated that the HLJ13SH01 strain replicated faster than other ALV-J layer isolates in vitro. Sequence analysis indicated that the main difference between the two isolates was the 5'-LTR sequences, particularly the U3 sequences. A 19 nt insertion was uniquely found in the U3 region of the HLJ13SH01 strain. The results of a Dual-Glo luciferase assay revealed that the 19 nt insertion in the HLJ13SH01 strain increased the enhancer activity of the U3 region. Moreover, an additional CCAAT/enhancer element was found in the 19 nt insertion and the luciferase assay indicated that this element played a key role in increasing the enhancer activity of the 5'-U3 region. To confirm the potentiation effect of the 19 nt insertion and the CCAAT/enhancer element on virus replication, three infectious clones with 5'-U3 region variations were constructed and rescued. Replication kinetic testing of the rescued viruses demonstrated that the CCAAT/enhancer element in the 19 nt insertion enhanced the replication capacity of the ALV-J recombinant in vitro.","['Gao, Yanni', 'Guan, Xiaolu', 'Liu, Yongzhen', 'Li, Xiaofei', 'Yun, Bingling', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Cui, Hongyu', 'Liu, Changjun', 'Zhang, Yanping', 'Wang, Xiaomei', 'Gao, Yulong']","['Gao Y', 'Guan X', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Yun B', 'Qi X', 'Wang Y', 'Gao H', 'Cui H', 'Liu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X', 'Gao Y']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Disease and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, 225009, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141001,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Chickens/*virology', 'China', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Rous sarcoma virus/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.071290-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2015 Jan;96(Pt 1):150-158. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.071290-0.

It is known that untranslated regions of the RNA can play a role in these processes. Here we show that THOC5, a member of the TREX (transcription/export) complex, plays a role in expression of only a subset of constitutively active genes, however transcriptome analysis reveals that more than 90% of IEG were not induced by serum in THOC5 depleted cells. Furthermore, THOC5 depletion does not influence the expression of the most rapidly induced IEGs, e.g. Fos and Jun. One group of THOC5 target genes, including Id1, Id3 and Wnt11 transcripts, were not released from chromatin in THOC5 depleted cells. Genes in another group, including Myc and Smad7 transcripts, were released with shortening of 3'UTR by alternative cleavage, and were spliced but export was impaired in THOC5 depleted cells. By interactome analysis using THOC5 as bait, we show that upon stimulation with serum THOC5 forms a complex with polyadenylation-specific factor 100 (CPSF100). THOC5 is required for recruitment of CPSF100 to 3'UTR of THOC5 target genes. These data suggest the presence of a novel mechanism for the control of IEG response by THOC5 via 3'end-processing.","['Tran, Doan Duy Hai', 'Saran, Shashank', 'Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Dittrich-Breiholz, Oliver', 'Wiehlmann, Lutz', 'Koch, Alexandra', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Tamura, Teruko']","['Tran DD', 'Saran S', 'Williamson AJ', 'Pierce A', 'Dittrich-Breiholz O', 'Wiehlmann L', 'Koch A', 'Whetton AD', 'Tamura T']","['Institut fuer Biochemie, OE4310, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institut fuer Biochemie, OE4310, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, 27 Palatine Road, Withington Manchester, M20 3LJ UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, 27 Palatine Road, Withington Manchester, M20 3LJ UK.', 'Institut fuer Biochemie, OE4310, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Padiatrische Pneumologie OE6710 Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institut fuer Biochemie, OE4310, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, 27 Palatine Road, Withington Manchester, M20 3LJ UK.', 'Institut fuer Biochemie, OE4310, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany tamura.teruko@Mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141001,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Smad7 Protein)', '0 (THOC5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor/*metabolism', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', ""*RNA 3' End Processing"", 'RNA Splicing', 'Smad7 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/03/11 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['gku911 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku911 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Oct 29;42(19):12249-60. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku911.

Significant progress occurred in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of APL. ATO, in contrast with ATRA, is capable of eradicating the APL-initiating cells and can result in cure. Preclinical and clinical data confirmed the synergy of ATO and ATRA, and the ATRA-ATO combination was proved noninferior to a standard ATRA-chemotherapy regimen in patients with non-high-risk APL. Oral formulations of arsenic exhibited excellent activity in advanced clinical testing and their combinations with ATRA offer an opportunity for a completely oral, chemotherapy-free regimen for curing APL. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain. Reducing early death due to bleeding complications is an important area of unmet need. Data suggest that delays in initiation of ATRA upon suspecting APL continue to occur in the community and contribute to early mortality. Questions remain about the optimal place and schedule of arsenic in the therapeutic sequence and the role of the oral formulations. Refining the role of minimal residual disease in directing treatment decisions is important. Development of novel targeted agents to treat relapsed disease requires deeper understanding of the secondary resistance mechanisms to ATRA and ATO.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Zeidan AM', 'Gore SD']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. amer.zeidan@yale.edu.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['20/19/4985 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2725 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Oct 1;20(19):4985-93. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2725.,['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['K24 CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4882758,['NIHMS787974'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For each wave, the host eventually finds a way to repress retrotransposon transcription and prevent further insertions. In mouse embryonic stem cells, transcriptional silencing of retrotransposons requires KAP1 (also known as TRIM28) and its repressive complex, which can be recruited to target sites by KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) proteins such as murine-specific ZFP809 which binds to integrated murine leukaemia virus DNA elements and recruits KAP1 to repress them. KZNF genes are one of the fastest growing gene families in primates and this expansion is hypothesized to enable primates to respond to newly emerged retrotransposons. However, the identity of KZNF genes battling retrotransposons currently active in the human genome, such as SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) and long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1), is unknown. Here we show that two primate-specific KZNF genes rapidly evolved to repress these two distinct retrotransposon families shortly after they began to spread in our ancestral genome. ZNF91 underwent a series of structural changes 8-12 million years ago that enabled it to repress SVA elements. ZNF93 evolved earlier to repress the primate L1 lineage until approximately 12.5 million years ago when the L1PA3-subfamily of retrotransposons escaped ZNF93's restriction through the removal of the ZNF93-binding site. Our data support a model where KZNF gene expansion limits the activity of newly emerged retrotransposon classes, and this is followed by mutations in these retrotransposons to evade repression, a cycle of events that could explain the rapid expansion of lineage-specific KZNF genes.","['Jacobs, Frank M J', 'Greenberg, David', 'Nguyen, Ngan', 'Haeussler, Maximilian', 'Ewing, Adam D', 'Katzman, Sol', 'Paten, Benedict', 'Salama, Sofie R', 'Haussler, David']","['Jacobs FM', 'Greenberg D', 'Nguyen N', 'Haeussler M', 'Ewing AD', 'Katzman S', 'Paten B', 'Salama SR', 'Haussler D']","['1] Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [2] [3] Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam 1098 XH, The Netherlands (F.M.J.J.); Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, California 94158, USA (D.G.); Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Queensland 4101, Australia (A.D.E.).', '1] Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [2] Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [3] [4] Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam 1098 XH, The Netherlands (F.M.J.J.); Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, California 94158, USA (D.G.); Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Queensland 4101, Australia (A.D.E.).', '1] Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [2] Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA.', 'Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA.', '1] Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [2] Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam 1098 XH, The Netherlands (F.M.J.J.); Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, California 94158, USA (D.G.); Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Queensland 4101, Australia (A.D.E.).', 'Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA.', 'Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA.', '1] Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA.', '1] Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California 95064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140928,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Retroelements)', '0 (ZNF91 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Primates/*genetics', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/01/27 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['nature13760 [pii]', '10.1038/nature13760 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2014 Dec 11;516(7530):242-5. doi: 10.1038/nature13760.

However the anti-tumor effect of NK cells decreases during pancreatic cancer progression. The regulatory pathways by which NK cells facilitate tumor immune escape are unclear, therefore our purpose was to investigate the roles of the contributory factors. METHODS: NK cells isolated from fresh healthy peripheral blood were co-cultured with normal human pancreatic ductal cells hTERT-HPNE and human pancreatic cancer cell lines SW1990 and BxPc-3 in vitro. Then NK cell function was determined by Flow cytometric analysis of surface receptors and cytotoxic granules in NK cells, NK cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity, and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cytokines. Expression level of MMP-9, IDO and COX-2 in hTERT-HPNE and SW1990 cells were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Statistical differences between data groups were determined by independent t-tests using SPSS 19.0 software. RESULTS: Our results showed that NK cell function was significantly downregulated following exposure to pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic cells, as demonstrated by lower expressions of activating surface receptors (NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp30 and NKp46) and cytotoxic granules (Perforin and Granzyme B); decreased secretion of cytokines (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma); and reduced cytotoxicity against myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Further investigations revealed that MMP-9 and IDO may be implicated in SW1990 cell-induced NK cell dysfunction by facilitating tumor immune evasion. Blockade by TIMP-1 and/or 1-MT could partially restore NK function. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, elevation of MMP-9 and IDO induced by pancreatic cancer cells mediates NK cell dysfunction. Our findings could contribute to the development of NK cell-based immunotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.","['Peng, Yun-Peng', 'Zhang, Jing-Jing', 'Liang, Wen-biao', 'Tu, Min', 'Lu, Zi-Peng', 'Wei, Ji-Shu', 'Jiang, Kui-Rong', 'Gao, Wen-Tao', 'Wu, Jun-Li', 'Xu, Ze-Kuan', 'Miao, Yi', 'Zhu, Yi']","['Peng YP', 'Zhang JJ', 'Liang WB', 'Tu M', 'Lu ZP', 'Wei JS', 'Jiang KR', 'Gao WT', 'Wu JL', 'Xu ZK', 'Miao Y', 'Zhu Y']","[""Department of General Surgery, The first Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210029, People's Republic of China. miaoyi@njmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-738 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-738 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Oct 2;14:738. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-738.,,,PMC4287420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to identify clinical parameters predictive of long-term renal and haematological toxicity (myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukaemia). METHODS: Of 807 patients studied at IEO-Milan (1997-2013), 793 (98 %) received (177)Lu (278, 34.4 %), (90)Y (358, 44.4 %) or (177)Lu and (90)Y combined (157. 19.5 %), and 14 (2 %) received combinations of PRRT and other agents. Follow-up was 30 months (1-180 months). The parameters evaluated included renal risk factors, bone marrow toxicity and PRRT features. Data analysis included multiple regression, random forest feature selection, and recursive partitioning and regression trees. RESULTS: Treatment with (90)Y and (90)Y + (177)Lu was more likely to result in nephrotoxicity than treatment with (177)Lu alone (33.6 %, 25.5 % and 13.4 % of patients, respectively; p < 0.0001). Nephrotoxicity (any grade), transient and persistent, occurred in 279 patients (34.6 %) and was severe (grade 3 + 4) in 12 (1.5 %). In only 20-27 % of any nephrotoxicity was the disease modelled by risk factors and codependent associations (p < 0.0001). Hypertension and haemoglobin toxicity were the most relevant factors. Persistent toxicity occurred in 197 patients (24.3 %). In only 22-34 % of affected patients was the disease modelled by the clinical data (p < 0.0001). Hypertension (regression coefficient 0.14, p < 0.0001) and haemoglobin toxicity (regression coefficient 0.21, p < 0.0001) were pertinent factors. Persistent toxicity was associated with shorter PRRT duration from the first to the last cycle (mean 387 vs. 658 days, p < 0.004). Myelodysplastic syndrome occurred in 2.35 % of patients (modelled by the clinical data in 30 %, p < 0.0001). Platelet toxicity grade (2.05 +/- 1.2 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.8, p < 0.0001) and longer PRRT duration (22.6 +/- 24 vs. 15.5 +/- 9 months, p = 0.01) were relevant. Acute leukaemia occurred in 1.1 % of patients (modelled by the clinical data in 18 %, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Identified risk factors provide a limited (<30 %) risk estimate even with target tissue dosimetry. These data strongly suggest the existence of unidentified individual susceptibilities to radiation-associated disease.","['Bodei, Lisa', 'Kidd, Mark', 'Paganelli, Giovanni', 'Grana, Chiara M', 'Drozdov, Ignat', 'Cremonesi, Marta', 'Lepensky, Christopher', 'Kwekkeboom, Dik J', 'Baum, Richard P', 'Krenning, Eric P', 'Modlin, Irvin M']","['Bodei L', 'Kidd M', 'Paganelli G', 'Grana CM', 'Drozdov I', 'Cremonesi M', 'Lepensky C', 'Kwekkeboom DJ', 'Baum RP', 'Krenning EP', 'Modlin IM']","['Division of Nuclear Medicine, European Institute of Oncology, via Ripamonti 435, 20141, Milan, Italy, lisa.bodei@ieo.it.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20141002,Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '5H0DOZ21UJ (Lutetium)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Lutetium/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/diagnosis/*radiotherapy', 'Octreotide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Peptide/metabolism', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00259-014-2893-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2015 Jan;42(1):5-19. doi: 10.1007/s00259-014-2893-5.

They are recognized as diagnostic, prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. However, predicting the functional effect of these genetic alterations beyond affected genes and their products is challenging because diseased phenotypes are likely dependent of complex molecular interaction networks. Using as models three different chromosomal translocations-ETV6-RUNX1 (TEL-AML1), BCR-ABL1, and TCF3-PBX1 (E2A-PBX1)-frequently found in precursor-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preB-ALL), we develop an approach to extract perturbed molecular interactions from gene expression changes. We show that the MYC and JunD transcriptional circuits are specifically deregulated after ETV6-RUNX1 and TCF3-PBX1 gene fusions, respectively. We also identified the bulk mRNA NXF1-dependent machinery as a direct target for the TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein. Through a novel approach combining gene expression and interactome data analysis, we provide new insight into TCF3-PBX1 and ETV6-RUNX1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Hajingabo, Leon Juvenal', 'Daakour, Sarah', 'Martin, Maud', 'Grausenburger, Reinhard', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Dequiedt, Franck', 'Simonis, Nicolas', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude']","['Hajingabo LJ', 'Daakour S', 'Martin M', 'Grausenburger R', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Dequiedt F', 'Simonis N', 'Twizere JC']","['Laboratoire de Bioinformatique des Genomes et des Reseaux, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, B-1050 Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna, 1180 Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratoire de Bioinformatique des Genomes et des Reseaux, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, B-1050 Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium jean-claude.twizere@ulg.ac.be nicolassimonis@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141001,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Maps/*genetics']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['mbc.E14-06-1038 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E14-06-1038 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2014 Dec 1;25(24):3973-85. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E14-06-1038.

Previously, we demonstrated that irradiated riboflavin (IR) has potential antitumoral effects against human leukemia cells (HL60), human prostate cancer cells (PC3), and mouse melanoma cells (B16F10) through a common mechanism that leads to apoptosis. Hence, we here investigated the effect of IR on 786-O cells, a known model cell line for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), which is characterized by high-risk metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. IR also induced cell death in 786-O cells by apoptosis, which was not prevented by antioxidant agents. IR treatment was characterized by downregulation of Fas ligand (TNF superfamily, member 6)/Fas (TNF receptor superfamily member 6) (FasL/Fas) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1a (TNFR1)/TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain (TRADD)/TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF) signaling pathways (the extrinsic apoptosis pathway), while the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was upregulated, as observed by an elevated Bcl-2 associated x protein/B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio, reduced cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (c-IAP1) expression, and increased expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). The observed cell death was caspase-dependent as proven by caspase 3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) cleavage. IR-induced cell death was also associated with downregulation of v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homologue (avian)/protein serine/threonine kinase B/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (Src/AKT/ERK1/2) pathway and activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38) and Jun-amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Interestingly, IR treatment leads to inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and reduced expression of renal cancer aggressiveness markers caveolin-1, low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMWPTP), and kinase insert domain receptor (a type III receptor tyrosine kinase) (VEGFR-2).

GDC-0152 down-regulated the IAPs including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (cIAP2) expression and induced the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.

Moreover, over-expression of MLL3 in ESCC cells inhibited cell proliferation and migration, while the knockdown expression of MLL3 promoted the tumorigenicity of ESCC cells. Mechanistically, MLL3 regulated the expression of multiple growth-related and migration-related genes.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed database derived from cancer and non-cancer patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation from August 2008 to August 2012 at a university-based center. We evaluated the reproductive outcome of those cancer and non-cancer patients that had frozen sperm and returned subsequently to the clinic for assisted reproduction. RESULTS: We studied 272 males with cancer and 296 infertile males. The most prevalent types of cancer in our cohort were lymphoma (25.3 %), testicular cancer (19.2 %), leukemia (7.3 %), and other malignancies including sarcoma, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system malignancies (48.2 %). The use rate of cryopreserved sperm was 10.7 % for cancer patients and 30.7 % for non-cancer patients. The mean age of males with cancer who returned to the clinic for fertility treatment was 36.7 +/- 6 years, and the diagnoses were testis cancer (43.4 %), lymphoma (36.9 %), leukemia (13 %), and other malignancies (6.7 %). Live birth rate of the cancer cohort was 62.1 %, which was higher than that of the normospermic non-cancer population (p < 0.0047). CONCLUSIONS: The use rate of cryopreserved sperm from oncofertility preservation cases is at around 10 %. The live birth rate using assisted reproductive technologies among these patients is at least comparable to that of the non-cancer population. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: To our knowledge, this was the first comparative study of male cancer survivors treated with ICSI using cryopreserved sperm, which were compared to non-cancer males undergoing the same treatment. Male fertility preservation is a highly valued service that should be strongly encouraged prior to beginning cytotoxic cancer treatment. These results can help healthcare professionals in oncology to improve the quality of counseling on fertility preservation when managing young men with newly diagnosed cancer that require gonadotoxic treatment.","['Garcia, Ainhoa', 'Herrero, Maria Belen', 'Holzer, Hananel', 'Tulandi, Togas', 'Chan, Peter']","['Garcia A', 'Herrero MB', 'Holzer H', 'Tulandi T', 'Chan P']","['MUHC Reproductive Center, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141002,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cryopreservation/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Fertility Preservation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*rehabilitation', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Semen Preservation/statistics & numerical data', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic', '*Survivors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/03 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-014-0398-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2015 Jun;9(2):208-14. doi: 10.1007/s11764-014-0398-7.

We performed a prospective high-dose myeloablative double-unit CB transplantation (CBT) trial in adults with high-risk acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia (MDS) between 2007 and 2011. The primary aim was to establish the 1-year overall survival in a multi-centre setting. Fifty-six patients (31 acute myeloid leukaemia, 19 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 4 other acute leukaemias, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) were transplanted at 10 centres. The median infused total nucleated cell doses were 2.62 (larger unit) and 2.02 (smaller unit) x 10(7) /kg. The cumulative incidence of day 100 neutrophil engraftment was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80-96). Day 180 grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was 64% (95%CI: 51-76) and 36% (95%CI: 24-49) of patients had chronic GVHD by 3-years. At 3-years post-transplant, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 39% (95%CI: 26-52), and the 3-year relapse incidence was 11% (95%CI: 4-21). With a median 37-month (range 23-71) follow-up of survivors, the 3-year disease-free survival was 50% (95%CI: 37-63). Double-unit CBT is a viable alternative therapy for high-risk acute leukaemia/ MDS in patients lacking a matched unrelated donor. This is especially important for minority patients. The relapse incidence was low but strategies to ameliorate TRM are needed.","['Barker, Juliet N', 'Fei, Mingwei', 'Karanes, Chatchada', 'Horwitz, Mitchell', 'Devine, Steven', 'Kindwall-Keller, Tamila L', 'Holter, Jennifer', 'Adams, Alexia', 'Logan, Brent', 'Navarro, Willis H', 'Riches, Marcie']","['Barker JN', 'Fei M', 'Karanes C', 'Horwitz M', 'Devine S', 'Kindwall-Keller TL', 'Holter J', 'Adams A', 'Logan B', 'Navarro WH', 'Riches M']","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141001,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Fetal Blood/*transplantation', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*therapy', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukaemia', 'adult cord blood transplantation', 'double cord', 'relapse', 'transplant-related mortality']",2014/10/02 06:00,2015/03/24 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13136 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Feb;168(3):405-12. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13136.

HSPs are regulated by heat shock factor1 (HSF1). HDAC6, a class IIb deacetylase, plays an essential role in tumorigenesis and cell stress response. HSPs, HSF1 and HDAC6 are up-regulated in cancer. In the present study, we explored the effect of curcumin, a phytochemical, on HSPs (27, 70, 90), HSF1 and HDAC6 in two different leukemia cell lines (K-562 and HL-60). The association between HDAC6, HSPs, and intrinsic oxidative stress was also investigated. Overexpression of HSPs (27, 70, 90), HSF1, and HDAC6 in leukemia cells were down-regulated by curcumin, and the effects on HSPs 27and 70 were less than that on HSP 90. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, leading to apoptosis. Different cell cycle regulatory proteins (p53, p21, cyclin B1, CDK1, Cdc25C) and some apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, Bad, Apaf1, AIF and Cyt c) were altered by curcumin. Increased ROS levels in leukemia cells were quenched by curcumin. A probable association between high ROS level and the overexpression of the tumor markers was established in this study. Thus, curcumin enhanced the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs imatinib-mesylate and cytarabine through the inhibition of the tumor markers.","['Sarkar, Ruma', 'Mukherjee, Apurba', 'Mukherjee, Sutapa', 'Biswas, Raj', 'Biswas, Jaydip', 'Roy, Madhumita']","['Sarkar R', 'Mukherjee A', 'Mukherjee S', 'Biswas R', 'Biswas J', 'Roy M']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis & Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Calcutta, India.', 'Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis & Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Calcutta, India.', 'Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis & Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata 700 026.', 'NSHM Knowledge Campus Calcutta (Group of Institutions), (WBUT), Calcutta, India.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis & Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Calcutta, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 6)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 6', 'Histone Deacetylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['0410fa476f5ceb7e,7ff089be0078bc5b [pii]', '10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.2014010913 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2014;33(3):247-63. doi: 10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.2014010913.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also tested whether DKK-1 and OPN levels could be of clinical or prognostic significance in CLL and NHL. Methods We included 36 CLL, 24 NHL patients, and 21 healthy controls. Patients' clinical and demographic features, treatment modalities, and response to treatment were recorded. DKK-1 and OPN levels in plasma obtained at initial diagnosis were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results CLL patients had significantly lower DKK-1 levels than NHL and control groups (P levels, respectively, 0.048 and 0.017). OPN level was significantly higher in NHL group than in CLL and control groups (P values, 0.017 and <0.001). CLL patients with early and late Rai stages of disease had similar DKK-1 and OPN levels. After a median follow-up of 48 months, 13 CLL patients died. Univariate analysis showed that advanced Rai stages and older age were significantly poor prognostic factors. DKK-1 level in CLL patients who have died was significantly lower than those who were alive (P = 0.035). NHL patients with extranodal involvement had significantly higher OPN levels than those with no involvement (P = 0.04). Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the Wnt pathway inhibitor DKK-1 was decreased in CLL. OPN was increased in NHL and associated with extranodal involvement.

However, the chromatin marks associated with changes in DNA methylation in adult stem cells during lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, DNA methylation profiling of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from individuals aged 2 to 92 yr identified 18,735 hypermethylated and 45,407 hypomethylated CpG sites associated with aging. As in differentiated cells, hypermethylated sequences were enriched in chromatin repressive marks. Most importantly, hypomethylated CpG sites were strongly enriched in the active chromatin mark H3K4me1 in stem and differentiated cells, suggesting this is a cell type-independent chromatin signature of DNA hypomethylation during aging. Analysis of scedasticity showed that interindividual variability of DNA methylation increased during aging in MSCs and differentiated cells, providing a new avenue for the identification of DNA methylation changes over time. DNA methylation profiling of genetically identical individuals showed that both the tendency of DNA methylation changes and scedasticity depended on nongenetic as well as genetic factors. Our results indicate that the dynamics of DNA methylation during aging depend on a complex mixture of factors that include the DNA sequence, cell type, and chromatin context involved and that, depending on the locus, the changes can be modulated by genetic and/or external factors.","['Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Bayon, Gustavo F', 'Urdinguio, Rocio G', 'Torano, Estela G', 'Garcia, Maria G', 'Carella, Antonella', 'Petrus-Reurer, Sandra', 'Ferrero, Cecilia', 'Martinez-Camblor, Pablo', 'Cubillo, Isabel', 'Garcia-Castro, Javier', 'Delgado-Calle, Jesus', 'Perez-Campo, Flor M', 'Riancho, Jose A', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Mentink, Anouk', 'Mareschi, Katia', 'Claire, Fabian', 'Fagnani, Corrado', 'Medda, Emanuela', 'Toccaceli, Virgilia', 'Brescianini, Sonia', 'Moran, Sebastian', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Stolzing, Alexandra', 'de Boer, Jan', 'Nistico, Lorenza', 'Stazi, Maria A', 'Fraga, Mario F']","['Fernandez AF', 'Bayon GF', 'Urdinguio RG', 'Torano EG', 'Garcia MG', 'Carella A', 'Petrus-Reurer S', 'Ferrero C', 'Martinez-Camblor P', 'Cubillo I', 'Garcia-Castro J', 'Delgado-Calle J', 'Perez-Campo FM', 'Riancho JA', 'Bueno C', 'Menendez P', 'Mentink A', 'Mareschi K', 'Claire F', 'Fagnani C', 'Medda E', 'Toccaceli V', 'Brescianini S', 'Moran S', 'Esteller M', 'Stolzing A', 'de Boer J', 'Nistico L', 'Stazi MA', 'Fraga MF']","['Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain;', 'Oficina de Investigacion Biosanitaria (OIB-FICYT) de Asturias, 33005 Oviedo, Spain and Universidad Autonoma de Chile, Chile;', 'Unidad de Biotecnologia Celular, Area de Genetica Humana, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain;', 'Unidad de Biotecnologia Celular, Area de Genetica Humana, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital U.M.

Increasing FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (P = .004) and IS in the tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TKD1, P = .06) were associated with low complete remission (CR) rates. After postremission therapy including intensive chemotherapy (n = 121) or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT, n = 17), an allelic ratio >/= 0.51 was associated with an unfavorable relapse-free (RFS, P = .0008) and overall survival (OS, P = .004); after allogeneic HSCT (n = 93), outcome was significantly improved in patients with a high allelic ratio (RFS, P = .02; OS, P = .03), whereas no benefit was seen in patients with a low allelic ratio (RFS, P = .38; OS, P = .64). Multivariable analyses revealed a high allelic ratio as a predictive factor for the beneficial effect of allogeneic HSCT; ITD IS in TKD1 remained an unfavorable factor, whereas no prognostic impact of concurrent gene mutations was observed.

The proviral load is strongly correlated with odds of the inflammatory disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). There is evidence that asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) have a more effective CD8 + T cell response, including a higher frequency of HLA class I alleles able to present peptides from a regulatory protein of HTLV-1, HBZ. We have previously shown that specific features of the host genome flanking the proviral integration site favour clone survival and spontaneous expression of the viral transactivator protein Tax in naturally infected PBMCs ex vivo. However, the previous studies were not designed or powered to detect differences in integration site characteristics between ACs and HAM/TSP patients. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the genomic environment of the provirus differs systematically between ACs and HAM/TSP patients, and between individuals with strong or weak HBZ presentation. METHODS: We used our recently described high-throughput protocol to map and quantify integration sites in 95 HAM/TSP patients and 68 ACs from Kagoshima, Japan, and 75 ACs from Kumamoto, Japan. Individuals with 2 or more HLA class I alleles predicted to bind HBZ peptides were classified 'strong' HBZ binders; the remainder were classified 'weak binders'. RESULTS: The abundance of HTLV-1-infected T cell clones in vivo was correlated with proviral integration in genes and in areas with epigenetic marks associated with active regulatory elements. In clones of equivalent abundance, integration sites in genes and active regions were significantly more frequent in ACs than patients with HAM/TSP, irrespective of HBZ binding and proviral load. Integration sites in genes were also more frequent in strong HBZ binders than weak HBZ binders. CONCLUSION: Clonal abundance is correlated with integration in a transcriptionally active genomic region, and these regions may promote cell proliferation. A clone that reaches a given abundance in vivo is more likely to be integrated in a transcriptionally active region in individuals with a more effective anti-HTLV-1 immune response, such those who can present HBZ peptides or those who remain asymptomatic.","['Niederer, Heather A', 'Laydon, Daniel J', 'Melamed, Anat', 'Elemans, Marjet', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Niederer HA', 'Laydon DJ', 'Melamed A', 'Elemans M', 'Asquith B', 'Matsuoka M', 'Bangham CR']","['Department of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College London, London W2 1PG, UK. c.bangham@imperial.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140930,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier State', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, MHC Class I/genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-11-172 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-11-172 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2014 Sep 30;11:172. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-11-172.,,"['100291/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0601072/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/J007439/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K019090/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC4192323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PV symptom burden can be considerable, in part driven by small or large vessel thrombotic tendency, splenomegaly, fatigue, pruritus, and a chronic risk of disease transformation to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, patients with PV have an increased risk of mortality compared with the general population that often results from cardiovascular complications or disease transformation. Further, healthcare utilization and costs are higher in patients with PV than noncancer controls. First-line therapy options for high-risk patients may effectively manage PV in some instances; however, some patients do not receive adequate benefit from current treatment options and experience a more severe disease burden as a result. This may be especially true for those patients who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea or interferon-based therapies. New treatments currently being investigated in phase 3 clinical trials may alleviate disease burden in this patient population.","['Stein, Brady L', 'Moliterno, Alison R', 'Tiu, Ramon V']","['Stein BL', 'Moliterno AR', 'Tiu RV']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 645 N.

Most compounds showed significant antiproliferative activities against four solid tumor cell lines, but no or poor activities against two leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, the target compounds were screened for Aurora A/B kinases inhibitory activity. Among them, 7c, 7d, 8c, and 8d are more potent against Aurora A kinase than ZM447439.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has the potential for a rapid and sensitive identification of high risk patients. Our group has previously published that MRD levels analyzed by clone specific Ig/TcR-QPCR and MFC were concordant at a sensitivity of 10(-4) . Here we report the MFC methodological aspects from this multi-center experience. Methods: MRD was assessed by MFC in 1030 follow-up samples from 265 pediatric and adult patients with de novo ALL treated in the FRALLE, EORTC or GRALL clinical trials. MRD assessment as applied by the eight participating MFC laboratories is described in detail regarding cell preparation, leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) markers and data analysis. Samples were obtained from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). Immunostaining was performed after erythrocyte lysis or Ficoll enrichment. Results: This study confirms the applicability of MFC-based MRD assessment in 97% of patients with ALL at the 10(-4) cut-off. MRD values after Ficoll enrichment and erythrocyte lysis were found comparable. Higher MRD values were obtained in BM than in PB, especially for B-lineage ALL. Conclusions: Measurement of MRD by MFC at the 10(-4) cut-off is applicable within a few hours for almost all patients and using a comparable analytical strategy allows for multicenter collaborative studies. The method can be introduced in a strategy aimed at defining the risk of failure of patients with childhood or adult ALL.

Tan-IIA can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer through different molecular mechanisms. However, the efficacy and molecular mechanism of Tan-IIA in gastric cancer have not been well studied. In the present study, the cytotoxicity of Tan-IIA in human gastric cancer AGS cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was examined. The protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (Mcl-1), translationally-controlled tumor protein (TCTP), binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), calnexin, protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, eIF2alpha, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha), ATF6, caspase-12, caspase-9, caspase-3, C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and beta-actin in AGS cells were measured by western blot analysis. The results showed that Tan-IIA inhibited AGS cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. AGS cells treated with Tan-IIA upregulated the protein expression of caspase-12, caspase-9, caspase--3, CHOP and Bax, but downregulated the protein expression of BiP, TCTP, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. These findings indicated that Tan-IIA inhibits the growth of human gastric cancer AGS cells. One of the molecular mechanisms may be through decreasing the protein expression of BiP to induce the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, followed by increasing the protein expression of caspase-12 to upregulate CHOP expression. The other may be through decreasing the protein expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and TCTP, but increasing Bax, caspase-9 and caspase-3 to induce apoptosis. The chemotherapeutic potential of Tan-IIA for human gastric cancer warrants further study in the future.","['Su, Chin-Cheng']",['Su CC'],"['Tumor Research Center of Integrative Medicine, Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 50006, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140929,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (TPT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*metabolism', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2014.1949 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2014 Dec;34(6):1661-8. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1949.

METHODS: The K562 cells were treated with Rh2(S) at various concentrations (10-80 mumol/L). Cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect cell cycle and apoptotic changes. The HDAC activity of cells was measured by chemical colorimetry. The protein expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2, cyclin D1, CDK4, p16INK4A and p21 after 48 hour-treatment of Rh2 (S) (10, 20, 40, 60 mumol/L) were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The proliferation of K562 cells was inhibited by Rh2 (S) (20-80 mumol/L) in dose-and time-dependent manner. FCM analyses revealed that the number of the K562 cells treated with 60 mumol/L Rh2(S) was arrested in G0/G1 phase.

CONCLUSION: The Rh2(S) can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and induce its cycle arrest and apoptosis through inhibiting HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity, down-regulating the expression of cyclin D1 and activating p16INK4A and p21.","['Xia, Jing', 'Chen, Dilong', 'Zuo, Guowei', 'Wei, Qiang', 'You, Zhimei', 'Li, Danyang', 'Liu, Zehong', 'Li, Jing']","['Xia J', 'Chen D', 'Zuo G', 'Wei Q', 'You Z', 'Li D', 'Liu Z', 'Li J']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Provincial and Ministry of Education Key Laboratories of Clinical Diagnostics, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '78214-33-2 (ginsenoside Rh2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Oct;30(10):1062-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This heterogeneity is often not reflected in standard treatment approaches which provide predictable outcomes in the majority of patients but fail in individual cases even with high-dose multi-agent chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Further, the unselective effect of chemotherapy causes high treatment-related toxicity and accelerates the risk of infection during prolonged pancytopenia, preventing further dose escalation. Despite rapid progress in therapeutic strategies, the fatality of high-grade malignancies remains enormous. OBJECTIVES: Adhesive interactions trigger signal transduction pathway activation and this prevents the apoptosis of both normal and malignant cells. A correlation between expression of defined adhesion molecules and patient outcome has been found for several malignant diseases including AML. We aim to describe how disruption of these signalling pathways can overcome the high resistance to treatment and increase the selectivity of targeting malignant cells. This could effectively reduce the overall treatment-related toxicity and improve the general outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesion molecules facilitate growth of malignant diseases. This review provides a deeper insight into these processes. Modulation of adhesion molecules-mediated interactions is an innovative and feasible approach in treatment of AML and many other malignancies. Due to expected low toxicity it is an acceptable addition to standard chemotherapeutical regimens for all age groups of patients. This approach could improve the overall treatment outcome in the future.","['Kupsa, Tomas', 'Horacek, Jan M', 'Jebavy, Ladislav']","['Kupsa T', 'Horacek JM', 'Jebavy L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20140926,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)'],IM,"['*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2016/11/09 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2014.049 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2015 Mar;159(1):1-11. doi: 10.5507/bp.2014.049.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the natural composition from green tea leaves Catechins on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). METHODS: In vitro, APL cell lines NB4, retinoic acid-resistant NB4-R1 and NB4-R2 were treated with different concentrations of Catechins. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were analyzed using MTT assay and flow cytometric assay, respectively. Expression of proteins related to apoptosis and PML-RARalpha oncoprotein were assessed by Western blot. In vivo anti-tumor activity of Catechins was examined in nude mice xenografted with NB4 cells and in situ cell apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxytransferase-catalyzed DNA nick-end labeling assay. RESULTS: Catechins at micromolar concentration levels significantly inhibited APL cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, in association with mitochondria damage, ROS production and caspase activation. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xL was down regulated, with pro-apoptotic member Bax remaining unchanged. Moreover, Catechins induced the degradation of PML-RARalpha oncoprotein. Catechins-mediated apoptotic effect was also observed in primary APL cells without affecting normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. In the murine xenograft model, Catechins remarkably inhibited tumor growth and induced in situ leukemic cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Catechins might be a potential candidate for APL treatment by activating intrinsic apoptotic pathway and targeting PML-RARalpha oncoprotein.","['Zhang, Li', 'Chen, Qiu-Sheng', 'Xu, Peng-Peng', 'Qian, Ying', 'Wang, Ai-Hua', 'Xiao, Dan', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Sheng, Yan', 'Wen, Xiang-Qin', 'Zhao, Wei-Li']","['Zhang L', 'Chen QS', 'Xu PP', 'Qian Y', 'Wang AH', 'Xiao D', 'Zhao Y', 'Sheng Y', 'Wen XQ', 'Zhao WL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141001,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Tea)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catechin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tea', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0075-3 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0075-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Oct 1;7:75. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0075-3.,,,PMC4197244,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Most relevant articles were included in the PubMed database between 2000 and 2013 with the keywords ""acute promyelocytic leukemia,"" ""arsenic trioxide,"" ""thiol"" or ""methylation."" In addition, a few older articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Data and articles related to arsenic trioxide effect in acute promyelocytic leukemia treatment were selected and reviewed. We developed an overview of limitations associated with arsenic trioxide therapeutic effect. RESULTS: This review focuses on the researches about the arsenic trioxide therapeutic effect in acute promyelocytic leukemia and summarizes three mainly limitations which can influence the arsenic trioxide therapeutic effect to different degrees. First, with the combination of arsenic and glutathione the therapeutic effect and cytotoxicity decrease when glutathione concentration increases; second, arsenic methylation, stable arsenic methylation products weaken the apoptosis effect of arsenic trioxide in leukemia cells; third, gene mutations affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to arsenic trioxide and increase the resistance of leukemia cells to arsenic trioxide. CONCLUSIONS: The chief limitations are listed in the review. If we can exclude all of them, we can obtain a better therapeutic effect of arsenic trioxide in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Sui, Meijuan', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Sui M', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China; Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China; Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China.

The evidence, however, is inconsistent and prospective data are sparse. We examined the association between prediagnostic total (low: <20; intermediate: 20-100; high >100 kU/l) and specific IgE (negative: <0.35; positive >/=0.35 kU/I) concentrations against inhalant antigens and lymphoma risk in a study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. A total of 1021 incident cases and matched controls of NHL, multiple myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin lymphoma with a mean follow-up time of 7 years were investigated. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Specific IgE was not associated with the risk of MM, B-cell NHL and B-cell NHL subtypes. In contrast, total IgE levels were inversely associated with the risk of MM [high level: OR = 0.40 (95% CI = 0.21-0.79)] and B-cell NHL [intermediate level: OR = 0.68 (95% CI = 0.53-0.88); high level: OR = 0.62 (95% CI = 0.44-0.86)], largely on the basis of a strong inverse association with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL; intermediate level: OR = 0.49 (95% CI = 0.30-0.80); high level: OR = 0.13 (95% CI = 0.05-0.35)] risk. The inverse relationship for CLL remained significant for those diagnosed 5 years after baseline. The findings of this large prospective study demonstrated significantly lower prediagnostic total IgE levels among CLL and MM cases compared with matched controls. This corresponds to the clinical immunodeficiency state often observed in CLL patients prior to diagnosis. No support for an inverse association between prediagnostic levels of specific IgE and NHL risk was found.","['Nieters, Alexandra', 'Luczynska, Anna', 'Becker, Susen', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Vermeulen,

PCP among these patients is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of PCP prophylaxis among non-HIV immunocompromised patients; and to define the type of immunocompromised patient for whom evidence suggests a benefit for PCP prophylaxis. SEARCH METHODS: Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to March 2014), LILACS (to March 2014), relevant conference proceedings; and references of identified trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing prophylaxis with an antibiotic effective against PCP versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotic(s) with no activity against PCP; and trials comparing different antibiotics effective against PCP among immunocompromised non-HIV patients. We only included trials in which Pneumocystis infections were available as an outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each trial and extracted data from the included trials. We contacted authors of the included trials to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was documented PCP infections. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials performed between the years 1974 and 2008 were included, involving 1412 patients. Four trials included 520 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the remaining trials included adults with acute leukemia, solid organ transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Compared to no treatment or treatment with fluoroquinolones (inactive against Pneumocystis), there was an 85% reduction in the occurrence of PCP in patients receiving prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; 10 trials, 1000 patients). The evidence was graded as moderate due to possible risk of bias. PCP-related mortality was also significantly reduced, RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; nine trials, 886 patients) (low quality of evidence due to possible risk of bias and imprecision), but in trials comparing PCP prophylaxis against placebo or no treatment there was no significant effect on all-cause mortality (low quality of evidence due to imprecision). Occurrence of leukopenia or neutropenia and their duration were not reported consistently. No significant differences in overall adverse events or events requiring discontinuation were seen comparing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to no treatment or placebo (four trials, 470 patients, moderate quality evidence). No differences between once daily versus thrice weekly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were seen (two trials, 207 patients). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given an event rate of 6.2% in the control groups of the included trials, prophylaxis for PCP using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is highly effective among non-HIV immunocompromised patients, with a number needed to treat to prevent PCP of 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42). Prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a similar baseline risk of PCP.","['Stern, Anat', 'Green, Hefziba', 'Paul, Mical', 'Vidal, Liat', 'Leibovici, Leonard']","['Stern A', 'Green H', 'Paul M', 'Vidal L', 'Leibovici L']","['Division of Infectoius Diseases, Rambam Health Care Campus, Ha-aliya 8 St, Haifa, Israel, 33705.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20141001,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*prevention & control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/10/02 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/10/02 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD005590.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Oct 1;(10):CD005590. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD005590.pub3.,,,PMC6457644,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007;(3):CD005590.

In this study, by means of the patch-clamp technique in attached and inside-out modes, we have characterized cationic channels, rapidly activated by membrane stretch in Jurkat T lymphoblasts. The half-activation was achieved at a negative pressure of ~50mm Hg. In attached mode, single channel currents displayed an inward rectification and the unitary conductance of ~40 pS at zero command voltage. In excised inside-out patches the rectification was transformed to an outward one. Mechanosensitive channels weakly discriminated between mono- and divalent cations (PCa/PNa~1) and were equally permeable for Ca(2)(+) and Mg(2)(+). Pharmacological analysis showed that the mechanosensitive channels were potently blocked by amiloride (1mM) and Gd(3)(+) (10 muM) in a voltage-dependent manner. They were also almost completely blocked by ruthenium red (1 muM) and SKF 96365 (250 muM), inhibitors of transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channels. At the same time, the channels were insensitive to 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB, 100 muM) or N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA, 50 muM), antagonists of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) or transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channels, respectively. Human TRPV2 siRNA virtually abolished the stretch-activated current. TRPV2 are channels with multifaceted functions and regulatory mechanisms, with potentially important roles in the lymphocyte Ca(2)(+) signaling. Implications of their regulation by mechanical stress are discussed in the context of lymphoid cells functions.","['Pottosin, Igor', 'Delgado-Enciso, Ivan', 'Bonales-Alatorre, Edgar', 'Nieto-Pescador, Maria G', 'Moreno-Galindo, Eloy G', 'Dobrovinskaya, Oxana']","['Pottosin I', 'Delgado-Enciso I', 'Bonales-Alatorre E', 'Nieto-Pescador MG', 'Moreno-Galindo EG', 'Dobrovinskaya O']","['Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'School of Medicine, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.

These novel 2-amino-chromene-3-carbonitriles showed cytotoxicity in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Compound 4 g was found to be the most bioactive, decreasing growth and increasing apoptosis of AML cells. Moreover, compound 4 g (at a concentration of 5 microM) increased the G2/M and sub-G1 (apoptosis) phases of AML cells. The AML cells treated with compound 4 g exhibited decreased levels of Bcl-2 and increased levels of caspase-9. In silico molecular interaction analysis showed that compound 4 g shared a similar global binding motif with navitoclax (another small molecule that binds Bcl-2), however compound 4 g occupies a smaller volume within the P2 hot spot of Bcl-2. The intermolecular pi-stacking interaction, direct electrostatic interactions, and docking energy predicted for 4 g in complex with Bcl-2 suggest a strong affinity of the complex, rendering 4 g as a promising Bcl-2 inhibitor for evaluation as a new anticancer agent.","['Keerthy, Hosadurga K', 'Garg, Manoj', 'Mohan, Chakrabhavi D', 'Madan, Vikas', 'Kanojia, Deepika', 'Shobith, Rangappa', 'Nanjundaswamy, Shivananju', 'Mason, Daniel J', 'Bender, Andreas', 'Basappa', 'Rangappa, Kanchugarakoppal S', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Keerthy HK', 'Garg M', 'Mohan CD', 'Madan V', 'Kanojia D', 'Shobith R', 'Nanjundaswamy S', 'Mason DJ', 'Bender A', 'Basappa', 'Rangappa KS', 'Koeffler HP']","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Department of Chemistry, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India.', 'Genomic Oncology Programme, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore, India.', 'Genomic Oncology Programme, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Genomic Oncology Programme, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Interdisciplinary Research Group of Infectious Diseases, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore, India.', 'Unilever Centre for Molecular Science Informatics, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Unilever Centre for Molecular Science Informatics, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Department of Chemistry, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore, India.', 'Genomic Oncology Programme, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedar-Sinai Medical Centre, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140930,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Benzopyrans/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Nitriles/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry']",,,2014/10/01 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107118 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-15339 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 30;9(9):e107118. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107118. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4182326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging roles of O-GlcNAcylation modification of proteins in various cancer types have implicated the key enzymes catalyzing this reversible modification as targets for cancer therapy. Here, we show that the highly selective O-GlcNAcase (OGA) inhibitor thiamet-G significantly sensitized human leukemia cell lines to paclitaxel, with an approximate 10-fold leftward shift of IC50. Knockdown of OGA by siRNAs or inhibition of OGA by thiamet-G did not influence the cell viability. Furthermore, we demonstrated that thiamet-G binds to OGA in competition with 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminide dehydrate, an analogue of O-GlcNAc UDP, thereby suppressing the activity of OGA. Importantly, inhibition of OGA by thiamet-G decreased the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein Tau and caused alterations of microtubule network in cells. It is noteworthy that paclitaxel combined with thiamet-G resulted in more profound perturbations on microtubule stability than did either one alone, which may implicate the underlying mechanism of thiamet-G-mediated sensitization of leukemia cells to paclitaxel. These findings thus suggest that a regimen of paclitaxel combined with OGA inhibitor might be more effective for the treatment of human leukemia.","['Ding, Ning', 'Ping, Lingyan', 'Shi, Yunfei', 'Feng, Lixia', 'Zheng, Xiaohui', 'Song, Yuqin', 'Zhu, Jun']","['Ding N', 'Ping L', 'Shi Y', 'Feng L', 'Zheng X', 'Song Y', 'Zhu J']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, No. 52 Fucheng Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, No. 52 Fucheng Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Pathology, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, No. 52 Fucheng Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, No. 52 Fucheng Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, No. 52 Fucheng Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, No. 52 Fucheng Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100142, China.

Increasing evidence suggests that the SUMO system also plays an important role in regulating chromatin organization and transcription. It is thus not surprising that double-stranded DNA viruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), have exploited SUMO modification as a means of modulating viral chromatin remodeling during the latent-lytic switch. In addition, SUMO regulation allows the disassembly and assembly of promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), an intrinsic antiviral host defense, during the viral replication cycle. Overcoming PML-NB-mediated cellular intrinsic immunity is essential to allow the initial transcription and replication of the herpesvirus genome after de novo infection. As a consequence, KSHV has evolved a way as to produce multiple SUMO regulatory viral proteins to modulate the cellular SUMO environment in a dynamic way during its life cycle. Remarkably, KSHV encodes one gene product (K-bZIP) with SUMO-ligase activities and one gene product (K-Rta) that exhibits SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) activity. In addition, at least two viral products are sumoylated that have functional importance. Furthermore, sumoylation can be modulated by other viral gene products, such as the viral protein kinase Orf36. Interference with the sumoylation of specific viral targets represents a potential therapeutic strategy when treating KSHV, as well as other oncogenic herpesviruses. Here, we summarize the different ways KSHV exploits and manipulates the cellular SUMO system and explore the multi-faceted functions of SUMO during KSHV's life cycle and pathogenesis.","['Chang, Pei-Ching', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien']","['Chang PC', 'Kung HJ']","['Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. pcchang@ym.edu.tw.', 'Institute for Translational Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. hkung@nhri.org.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140929,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,,,2014/10/01 06:00,2014/10/01 06:01,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers6041905 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers6041905 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2014 Sep 29;6(4):1905-24. doi: 10.3390/cancers6041905.,,['P30 CA093373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4276950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, CLL is still an incurable disease due to the persistence of residual leukemic cells. These patients may therefore benefit from immunotherapy approaches aimed at immunoreconstitution and/or the elimination of residual disease following chemotherapy. For these purposes, we designed a simple GMP-compliant protocol for ex vivo expansion of normal T cells from CLL patients' peripheral blood for adoptive therapy, using bispecific Ab blinatumomab (CD3 x CD19), acting both as T cell stimulator and CLL depletion agent, and human rIL-2. Starting from only 10 ml CLL peripheral blood, a mean 515 x 10(6) CD3(+) T cells were expanded in 3 wk. The resulting blinatumomab-expanded T cells (BET) were polyclonal CD4(+) and CD8(+) and mostly effector and central memory cells. The Th1 subset was slightly prevalent over Th2, whereas Th17 and T regulatory cells were <1%. CMV-specific clones were detected in equivalent proportion before and after expansion. Interestingly, BET cells had normalized expression of the synapse inhibitors CD272 and CD279 compared with starting T cells and were cytotoxic against CD19(+) targets in presence of blinatumomab in vitro. In support of their functional capacity, we observed that BET, in combination with blinatumomab, had significant therapeutic activity in a systemic human diffuse large B lymphoma model in NOD-SCID mice. We propose BET as a therapeutic tool for immunoreconstitution of heavily immunosuppressed CLL patients and, in combination with bispecific Ab, as antitumor immunotherapy.","['Golay, Josee', ""D'Amico, Anna"", 'Borleri, Gianmaria', 'Bonzi, Michela', 'Valgardsdottir, Rut', 'Alzani, Rachele', 'Cribioli, Sabrina', 'Albanese, Clara', 'Pesenti, Enrico', 'Finazzi, Maria Chiara', 'Quaresmini, Giulia', 'Nagorsen, Dirk', 'Introna, Martino', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Golay J', ""D'Amico A"", 'Borleri G', 'Bonzi M', 'Valgardsdottir R', 'Alzani R', 'Cribioli S', 'Albanese C', 'Pesenti E', 'Finazzi MC', 'Quaresmini G', 'Nagorsen D', 'Introna M', 'Rambaldi A']","['Centro di Terapia Cellulare, ""G.

SAMHD1 is a major regulator of cellular dNTP levels in mammalian cells. Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the autoimmune condition Aicardi Goutieres syndrome (AGS). The dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 can be regulated by dGTP, with which SAMHD1 assembles into catalytically active tetramers. Here we present extensive biochemical and structural data that reveal an exquisite activation mechanism of SAMHD1 via combined action of both GTP and dNTPs. We obtained 26 crystal structures of SAMHD1 in complex with different combinations of GTP and dNTP mixtures, which depict the full spectrum of GTP/dNTP binding at the eight allosteric and four catalytic sites of the SAMHD1 tetramer. Our data demonstrate how SAMHD1 is activated by binding of GTP or dGTP at allosteric site 1 and a dNTP of any type at allosteric site 2. Our enzymatic assays further reveal a robust regulatory mechanism of SAMHD1 activity, which bares resemblance to that of the ribonuclease reductase responsible for cellular dNTP production. These results establish a complete framework for a mechanistic understanding of the important functions of SAMHD1 in the regulation of cellular dNTP levels, as well as in HIV restriction and the pathogenesis of CLL and AGS.","['Ji, Xiaoyun', 'Tang, Chenxiang', 'Zhao, Qi', 'Wang, Wei', 'Xiong, Yong']","['Ji X', 'Tang C', 'Zhao Q', 'Wang W', 'Xiong Y']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520 yong.xiong@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140929,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Allosteric Site', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nucleotides/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/metabolism', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1', 'Substrate Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['HIV restriction factor', 'allosteric regulation', 'dNTP metabolism', 'tetramerization', 'triphosphohydrolase']",2014/10/01 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1412289111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1412289111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Oct 14;111(41):E4305-14. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1412289111.

This study seeks to determine effects on cell migration of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) incubated with di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) at concentrations found in blood bags. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were incubated with DEHP concentrations ranging from 0.1 mug/ml to 1000 mug/ml, diluted in DMSO, over 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Migration rate was analyzed along an SDF-1alpha gradient using Transwell migration inserts. RESULTS: Of the applied concentrations 100 mug/ml, 250 mug/ml, 500 mug/ml, and 1000 mug/ml showed a significant decrease in migration rates relative to DMSO control at all measuring points (p < 0.05), with relative migration rates between 37.87 % for 100 mug/ml and 25.34 % for 1000 mug/ml relative to DMSO after 24 h of stimulation and 19.73 % for 100 mug/ml and 14.69 % for 1000 mug/ml respectively after 72 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate HL-60 to be a suitable in vitro model for examining effects of DEHP on the migration of blood and nucleated cells at concentrations found in blood bags.","['Manz, Patrick', 'Cadeddu, Ron-Patrick', 'Wilk, Matthias', 'Fritz, Birgit', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Wenzel, Folker']","['Manz P', 'Cadeddu RP', 'Wilk M', 'Fritz B', 'Haas R', 'Wenzel F']","['Hochschule Furtwangen University, Villingen-Schwenningen, BW, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, NRW, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, NRW, Germany.', 'Hochschule Furtwangen University, Villingen-Schwenningen, BW, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, NRW, Germany.', 'Hochschule Furtwangen University, Villingen-Schwenningen, BW, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,9709206,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Plasticizers)', 'C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Plasticizers/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['DEHP', 'HL-60 promyelocytes', 'MEHP', 'Phthalates', 'apoptosis', 'migration', 'vitality']",2014/10/01 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['03N251W4K17556X1 [pii]', '10.3233/CH-141903 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc. 2014;58(1):241-6. doi: 10.3233/CH-141903.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saturation of surface CD25 on circulating ATL cells was achieved at all doses; however saturation on ATL cells in lymph nodes required 8 mg/kg. Up to 8 mg/kg of daclizumab administered every 3 weeks was well tolerated. No responses were observed in 18 patients with acute or lymphoma ATL; however, 6 partial responses were observed in 16 chronic and smoldering ATL patients.

In vitro studies thus far demonstrated that Taspase1 plays important roles in the proliferation of various cancer cell lines, including HER2-positive breast cancer cells. To investigate the role of Taspase1 in breast tumorigenesis in vivo, we deleted Taspase1 from mouse mammary glands by generating MMTV-neu;MMTV-cre;Tasp1(F/-) mice. We demonstrate that initiation of MMTV-neu- but not MMTV-wnt-driven breast cancer is blocked in the absence of Taspase1. Importantly, Taspase1 loss alone neither impacts normal development nor pregnancy physiology of the mammary gland. In mammary glands Taspase1 deficiency abrogates MMTV-neu-induced cyclins E and A expression, thereby preventing tumorigenesis. The mechanisms were explored in HER2-positive breast cancer cell line BT474 and HER2-transformed MCF10A cells and validated using knockdown-resistant Taspase1. As Taspase1 was shown to cleave MLL which forms complexes with E2F transcription factors to regulate Cyclins E, A, and B expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we investigated whether the cleavage of MLL by Taspase1 constitutes an essential in vivo axis for HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis. To this end, we generated MMTV-neu;MLL(nc/nc) transgenic mice that carry homozygous non-cleavable MLL alleles. Remarkably, these mice are also protected from HER2/neu-driven breast tumorigenesis. Hence, MLL is the primary Taspase1 substrate whose cleavage is required for MMTV-neu-induced tumor formation. As Taspase1 plays critical roles in breast cancer pathology, it may serve as a therapeutic target for HER2-positive human breast cancer.","['Dong, Yiyu', 'Van Tine, Brian A', 'Oyama, Toshinao', 'Wang, Patricia I', 'Cheng, Emily H', 'Hsieh, James J']","['Dong Y', 'Van Tine BA', 'Oyama T', 'Wang PI', 'Cheng EH', 'Hsieh JJ']","['Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', '1] Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA [2] Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', '1] Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA [2] Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA [3] Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140930,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin E/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Lactation', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/10/01 06:00,2015/07/07 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cr2014129 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2014.129 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2014 Nov;24(11):1354-66. doi: 10.1038/cr.2014.129.

Subjects were 4369 patients diagnosed with ATL aged 18 years or older. The subjects were categorized into four treatment groups: no agent, chemotherapy, chemotherapy + steroids and steroids. We described the risks of PCP among ATL patients without prophylaxis. Risks of PCP were 3.2% for the no agent group, 9.7% for the chemotherapy group, 10.0% for the chemotherapy + steroids group and 16.6% for the steroids group. Logistic regression analyses showed that the chemotherapy, chemotherapy + steroids and steroids groups had significantly higher risk of PCP than did the no agent group [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.30 (1.55-7.02), P = 0.002 for the chemotherapy group; AOR 3.35 (2.18-5.17), P < 0.001 for the chemotherapy + steroids group; AOR 6.12 (3.99-9.38), P < 0.001 for the steroids group].

DESIGN: Comparative, descriptive. SETTING: Pediatric oncology clinic and communities in Colorado. SAMPLE: 26 dyads of mothers and children with ALL and matched controls. METHODS: Mothers completed insomnia severity, mood, and stress questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraph, and mothers and children completed a seven-day sleep diary. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Mother and child sleep parameters (e.g., total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, awakenings); maternal insomnia severity, mood, and stress; child sleep habits. FINDINGS: Mothers of children with ALL reported greater insomnia compared to controls, which was correlated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, and stress. Maternal groups did not differ on diary- and actigraph-measured sleep outcomes; both groups experienced sleep fragmentation. Children with ALL took longer to fall asleep and had more variable sleep patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Actigraph and sleep diary data indicated adequate maternal sleep duration and sleep latency. Self-reported insomnia severity in mothers of children with ALL suggested sleep fragmentation that may be undetected by these measures. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Oncology nurses are in a unique position to identify sleep problems in mothers and children with ALL, which may lead to recommendations for improved sleep and referrals for treatment.","['Matthews, Ellyn E', 'Neu, Madalynn', 'Cook, Paul F', 'King, Nancy']","['Matthews EE', 'Neu M', 'Cook PF', 'King N']","['College of Nursing, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.', 'College of Nursing, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.', 'College of Nursing, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mothers', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'caregivers', 'insomnia', 'maintenance treatment', 'pediatric cancer', 'sleep disturbance']",2014/10/01 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['17522V65P1T62420 [pii]', '10.1188/14.ONF.41-06P [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2014 Nov 1;41(6):599-610. doi: 10.1188/14.ONF.41-06P.,,"['UL1 RR025780/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1UL1RR014780/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which Ezh2 expression is regulated is not well defined. In the current study, we report that c-Rel is a critical activator of Ezh2 transcription in lymphoid cells. In activated primary murine B and T cells, plus human leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines, recruitment of c-Rel to the first intron of the Ezh2 locus promoted Ezh2 mRNA expression. This up-regulation was abolished in activated c-Rel-deficient lymphocytes and by c-Rel knockdown in Jurkat T cells. Treatment of malignant cells with the c-Rel inhibitor pentoxifylline not only reduced c-Rel nuclear translocation and Ezh2 expression, but also enhanced their sensitivity to the Ezh2-specific drug, GSK126 through increased growth inhibition and cell death. In summary, our demonstration that c-Rel regulates Ezh2 expression in lymphocytes and malignant lymphoid cells reveals a novel transcriptional network in transformed lymphoid cells expressing high levels of Ezh2 that provides a molecular justification for combinatorial drug therapy.","['Neo, Wen Hao', 'Lim, Jun Feng', 'Grumont, Raelene', 'Gerondakis, Steve', 'Su, I-Hsin']","['Neo WH', 'Lim JF', 'Grumont R', 'Gerondakis S', 'Su IH']","['School of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637551, Republic of Singapore and.', 'School of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637551, Republic of Singapore and.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637551, Republic of Singapore and.

In the early reconstitution phase following HSCT, natural killer (NK) cells represent the major lymphocyte population in peripheral blood and display graft-vs-leukemia (GvL) effects. The functional interactions between NK cells and MSCs have the potential to influence the leukemia relapse rate after HSCT. Until date, MSC-NK cell interaction studies are largely focussed on bone marrow derived (BM)-MSCs. Umbilical cord derived (UC)-MSCs might be an alternative source of therapeutic MSCs. Thus, we studied the interaction of UC-MSCs with unstimulated allogeneic NK cells. RESULTS: UC-MSCs could potently suppress NK cell cytotoxicity in overnight cultures via soluble factors. The main soluble immunosuppressant was identified as prostaglandin (PG)-E2. Maximal PGE2 release involved IL-1beta priming of MSCs after close contact between the NK cells and UC-MSCs. Interestingly, blocking gamma-secretase activation alleviated the immunosuppression by controlling PGE2 production. IL-1 receptor activation and subsequent downstream signalling events were found to require gamma-secretase activity. CONCLUSION: Although the role of PGE2 in NK cell-MSC has been reported, the requirement of cell-cell contact for PGE2 induced immunosuppression remained unexplained. Our findings shed light on this puzzling observation and identify new players in the NK cell-MSC crosstalk.","['Chatterjee, Debanjana', 'Marquardt, Nicole', 'Tufa, Dejene Milkessa', 'Beauclair, Guillaume', 'Low, Hui Zhi', 'Hatlapatka, Tim', 'Hass, Ralf', 'Kasper, Cornelia', 'von Kaisenberg, Constantin', 'Schmidt, Reinhold Ernst', 'Jacobs, Roland']","['Chatterjee D', 'Marquardt N', 'Tufa DM', 'Beauclair G', 'Low HZ', 'Hatlapatka T', 'Hass R', 'Kasper C', 'von Kaisenberg C', 'Schmidt RE', 'Jacobs R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140930,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology']",,,2014/10/01 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['s12964-014-0063-9 [pii]', '10.1186/s12964-014-0063-9 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2014 Sep 30;12:63. doi: 10.1186/s12964-014-0063-9.,,,PMC4195898,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to identify differentially methylated genes with potential impact on AML pathogenesis based on the correlation of methylation and expression data. METHODS: The primary method of studying DNA methylation changes was targeted bisulfite sequencing capturing approximately 84 megabases (Mb) of the genome in 14 diagnostic AML patients and a healthy donors' CD34+ pool. Subsequently, selected DNA methylation changes were confirmed by 454 bisulfite pyrosequencing in a larger cohort of samples. Furthermore, we addressed gene expression by microarray profiling and correlated methylation of regions adjacent to transcription start sites with expression of corresponding genes. RESULTS: Here, we report a novel hypomethylation pattern, specific to CBFB-MYH11 fusion resulting from inv(16) rearrangement that is associated with genes previously described as upregulated in inv(16) AML. We assume that this hypomethylation and corresponding overexpresion occurs in the genes whose function is important in inv(16) leukemogenesis. Further, by comparing all targeted methylation and microarray expression data, PBX3 differential methylation was found to correlate with its gene expression. PBX3 has been recently shown to be a key interaction partner of HOX genes during leukemogenesis and we revealed higher incidence of relapses in PBX3-overexpressing patients. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered new genomic regions with aberrant DNA methylation that are associated with expression of genes involved in leukemogenesis. Our results demonstrate the potential of the targeted approach for DNA methylation studies to reveal new regulatory regions.","['Hajkova, Hana', 'Fritz, Markus Hsi-Yang', 'Haskovec, Cedrik', 'Schwarz, Jiri', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Markova, Jana', 'Krejcik, Zdenek', 'Dostalova Merkerova, Michaela', 'Kostecka, Arnost', 'Vostry, Martin', 'Fuchs, Ota', 'Michalova, Kyra', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Benes, Vladimir']","['Hajkova H', 'Fritz MH', 'Haskovec C', 'Schwarz J', 'Salek C', 'Markova J', 'Krejcik Z', 'Dostalova Merkerova M', 'Kostecka A', 'Vostry M', 'Fuchs O', 'Michalova K', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Benes V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140930,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome']",,,2014/10/01 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0066-4 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0066-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Sep 30;7:66. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0066-4.,,,PMC4197269,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report two phenotypically and cytogenetically normal children with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) whose blasts had both acquired trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutation. Patient 1 was diagnosed with transient abnormal myelopoiesis in the neonatal period. Following spontaneous improvement of the disease, leukemic blasts increased 7 months later. He received less intensive chemotherapy, and he is now 6 years old in complete remission. Patient 2 was diagnosed with AMKL at the age of 18 months. Although he received intensive chemotherapy and a cord blood transplantation, he died without gaining remission. In both cases, trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutation were detected only in leukemic blasts, but not in germline samples. Based on a literature review, we identified reports describing 14 non-DS AMKL with GATA1 mutation and acquired trisomy 21. Of those, 12 cases were diagnosed during the neonatal period, whereas the remaining 2 cases were diagnosed at the age of 22 and 31 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: These cases suggest that GATA1 mutation may cooperate with the additional chromosome 21 in developing myeloid proliferations even in non-DS patients.","['Ono, Rintaro', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Hirabayashi, Shinsuke', 'Kamiya, Takahiro', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Yonekawa, Satoko', 'Ogawa, Chitose', 'Hosoya, Ryota', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Manabe, Atsushi']","['Ono R', 'Hasegawa D', 'Hirabayashi S', 'Kamiya T', 'Yoshida K', 'Yonekawa S', 'Ogawa C', 'Hosoya R', 'Toki T', 'Terui K', 'Ito E', 'Manabe A']","[""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1, Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan, rin.r34@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20140930,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype']",,,2014/10/01 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2014/10/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-014-2430-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2015 Apr;174(4):525-31. doi: 10.1007/s00431-014-2430-3.

We hypothesized that HaH has antitumour effects not only against bladder cancer, as previously shown with other hemocyanins, but also on other cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative properties of the mentioned hemocyanins were investigated in vitro on the following human cell lines: bladder cancer (CAL-29 and T-24), ovarian cancer (FraWu), acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1), prostate cancer (DU-145), glioma cancer (LN-18), and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi). The properties of HaH were compared to those of HlH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and two positive controls (doxorubicin and mitomycin C). An antiproliferative effect of the total molecule and one structural subunit of HaH, betac-HaH, against both bladder cancer cell lines, T-24 and CAL-29, was observed. The cytotoxic effect of HaH ranged between 15% and 60% among the other tested cell lines. The endotoxin contamination did not affect the efficacy of HaH. Therefore, HlH and HaH could be appropriate for more detailed investigations of their use as antitumour agents for the studied cancers.","['Antonova, Olga', 'Dolashka, Pavlina', 'Toncheva, Draga', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Floetenmeyer, Matthias', 'Stevanovic, Stefan']","['Antonova O', 'Dolashka P', 'Toncheva D', 'Rammensee HG', 'Floetenmeyer M', 'Stevanovic S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Long noncoding RNAs are emerging as new players in gene regulation, but how long noncoding RNAs operate in the development of atherosclerosis remains unclear. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using microarray analysis, we found that long noncoding RNA RP5-833A20.1 expression was upregulated, whereas nuclear factor IA (NFIA) expression was downregulated in human acute monocytic leukemia macrophage-derived foam cells. Moreover, we showed that long noncoding RNA RP5-833A20.1 may decreases NFIA expression by inducing hsa-miR-382-5p expression in vitro. We found that the RP5-833A20.1/hsa-miR-382-5p/NFIA pathway is essential to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory responses in human acute monocytic leukemia macrophages. Lentivirus-mediated NFIA overexpression increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol circulation, reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol circulation, decreased circulation of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein, enhanced reverse cholesterol transport, and promoted regression of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that the RP5-833A20.1/miR-382-5p/NFIA pathway was essential to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory reactions and suggested that NFIA may represent a therapeutic target to ameliorate cardiovascular disease.","['Hu, Yan-Wei', 'Zhao, Jia-Yi', 'Li, Shu-Fen', 'Huang, Jin-Lan', 'Qiu, Yu-Rong', 'Ma, Xin', 'Wu, Shao-Guo', 'Chen, Zhi-Ping',

In this study, we further investigated whether the STFD reverse MDR through either the inhibition of P-gp function or expression in K562/Adr cells, or both. The P-gp functional studies showed that the STFD increased the accumulation of calcein-AM, rhodamine 123 and [(14) C]-doxorubicin in K562/Adr cells, while the effects have not been seen in their parental sensitive cancer cell line (K562). Further, the STFD did not alter the P-gp expression as determined by Western blotting. This study concludes that the STFD reverse MDR via the inhibition of P-gp function. The efficacy of the STFD to inhibit P-gp function followed the order: NH-B6 > OH-A1 > NH-D6.

Collagen digesting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes have been implicated in for their role in various malignancies and to promote metastasis. Biological agents that prevent extracellular matrix digestion by the MMPs have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches to cancer. In this study, we investigated effects of a nutrient mixture (NM) containing, ascorbic acid, lysine, proline and green tea extract, on human FANCA and FANCC lymphoblasts for viability, MMP secretion and invasion. METHODS: Human FANCA lymphoblasts GM13022 and HCS536 were challenged with NM at concentration range within 10-1000 microg/ml. Cell toxicity was assessed by Trypan blue dye exclusion test. Invasion was evaluated through Matrigel and gelatinase zymography for MMP activity. RESULTS: NM was toxic in dose dependent mode to HCS536 cells but not to GM13022 cells. GM13022 cells but not HCS536 cells exhibited MMP-9 secretion, which was inhibited by NM. Matrigel invasion was inhibited in HCS536 cells at 100 and 500 microg/ml by 27% and 93%, respectively. In GM13022 cells, the NM showed completely blocked Matrigel invasion at 500 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: NM inhibited MMP secretion and Matrigel invasion in FANCA and inhibited invasion and induced toxicity in FANCC lymphoblasts. These results suggest that the NM may have therapeutic potential in Fanconi anemia associated neoplasia.","['Roomi, M W', 'Bhanap, B', 'Roomi, N W', 'Niedzwiecki, A', 'Rath, M']","['Roomi MW', 'Bhanap B', 'Roomi NW', 'Niedzwiecki A', 'Rath M']","['Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara CA-95035, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara CA-95035, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara CA-95035, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara CA-95035, USA.', 'Dr. Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara CA-95035, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tea)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Fanconi Anemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine/administration & dosage', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proline/administration & dosage', 'Tea/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/09/30 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['7225 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2014 Sep;36(3):212-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding, the significance of these associations has not been well understood. Therefore, we have decided to analyze them further. METHODS: We provide herein a comprehensive literature review of the prevalence of autoimmune disorders in patients with HCL. Most relevant publications were identified through searching the PubMed/Medline database for articles published from inception to February 2014. FINDINGS: Perhaps due to the rarity of HCL, scientific literature on autoimmune conditions in patients with HCL consists mainly of published case series and isolated reports. Our analysis identified increased prevalence of various autoimmune conditions in patients with HCL, including various vasculitides, immune cytopenias and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) among others. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of certain autoimmune disorders should increase the suspicion of HCL in an appropriate clinico-laboratory context. Conversely, the diagnosis of HCL should prompt early recognition of certain autoimmune disorders if clinical suspicion exists. While some of these autoimmune diseases are thought to be secondary to the dysfunctional immune response associated with underlying malignant process, others could be primary and might even play a role in the HCL pathogenesis. The autoimmune complications can pose important clinical problems for the HCL patients. Therefore, a catalogue of these problems is important for alerting physicians to watch for them and diagnose them promptly.","['Dasanu, Constantin A', 'Van den Bergh, Magali', 'Pepito, Donna', 'Alvarez Argote, Juliana']","['Dasanu CA', 'Van den Bergh M', 'Pepito D', 'Alvarez Argote J']","['Lucy Curci Cancer Center, Eisenhower Medical Center , Rancho Mirage, CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141017,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Prevalence']",['NOTNLM'],"['Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome', 'Autoimmune disorders', 'Collagen vascular disorders', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Immune cytopenia', 'Vasculitis']",2014/09/30 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.971358 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2015 Jan;31(1):17-23. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.971358.

They are difficult to classify by imaging alone and biopsy may damage visual function. Tumor pathology influences treatment decision and a diagnostic tool with a high sensitivity and specificity would therefore be invaluable. We hypothesized that Ga-68-DOTA-TATE PET/CT may help in discriminating optic nerve tumors as uptake of somatostatin is elevated in meningiomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ga-68-DOTA-TATE PET/CT was used to examine 13 patients with ambiguous, symptomatic lesions of the optic pathway for treatment planning. The presence or absence of meningioma was validated by histopathology or supplementary diagnostic work-up. RESULTS: Ga-68-DOTA-TATE PET/CT identified 10 meningiomas (en plaque = 1, optic nerve sheath = 4, sphenoidal = 5) correctly via increased SSTR (somatostatin receptor) expression (mean SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value) = 14.3 +/- 15.4). 3 tumors did not show elevated Ga-68-DOTA-TATE uptake (SUVmax = 2.1 +/- 1.0). Subsumizing all clinical-radiological follow-up tools available, these lesions were classified as an intracerebral metastasis of an advanced gastric carcinoma, histologically proven inflammatory collagenous connective tissue and presumed leukemic infiltration of a newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this case series, Ga-68-DOTA-TATE PET/CT demonstrated both a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Yet, the golden standard of histopathology was only available in a subset of patients included. CONCLUSION: Ga-68-DOTA-TATE PET/CT proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for the correct classification of equivocal, symptomatic tumors of the anterior optic pathway requiring therapy. PET/CT results influenced therapy decision essentially in all cases.","['Klingenstein, Annemarie', 'Haug, Alexander R', 'Miller, Christina', 'Hintschich, Christoph']","['Klingenstein A', 'Haug AR', 'Miller C', 'Hintschich C']","['Department of Ophthalmology , and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140929,England,Orbit,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8301221,"['0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '9L17Y0H71P (gallium Ga 68 dotatate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningioma/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Multimodal Imaging', 'Optic Nerve/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', '*Organometallic Compounds', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anterior optic pathway', 'Ga-68-DOTA-TATE PET/CT', 'meningioma', 'tumor']",2014/09/30 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01676830.2014.959185 [doi]'],ppublish,Orbit. 2015 Feb;34(1):16-22. doi: 10.3109/01676830.2014.959185.

Nanotechnology is envisioned as a strategy to overcome these effects and to improve anticancer therapy. Nanoemulsions comprise submicron emulsions composed of biocompatible lipids, and present a large surface area revealing interesting physical properties. Chalcones are flavonoid precursors, and have been studied as cytotoxic drugs for leukemia cells that induce cell death by different apoptosis pathways. In this study, we encapsulated chalcones in a nanoemulsion and compared their effect with the respective free compounds in leukemia and in non-tumoral cell lines, as well as in an in vivo model. Free and loaded-nanoemulsion chalcones induced a similar anti-leukemic effect. Free chalcones induced higher toxicity in VERO cells than chalcones-loaded nanoemulsions. Similar results were observed in vivo. Free chalcones induced a reduction in weight gain and liver injuries, evidenced by oxidative stress, as well as an inflammatory response. Considering the high toxicity and the side effects induced generally by all cancer chemotherapies, nanotechnology provides some options for improving patients' life quality and/or increasing survival rates.","['Winter, Evelyn', 'Pizzol, Carine Dal', 'Locatelli, Claudriana', 'Silva, Adny H', 'Conte, Aline', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre, Louise D', 'Nunes, Ricardo J', 'Yunes, Rosendo A', 'Creckzynski-Pasa, Tania B']","['Winter E', 'Pizzol CD', 'Locatelli C', 'Silva AH', 'Conte A', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre LD', 'Nunes RJ', 'Yunes RA', 'Creckzynski-Pasa TB']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, P.O.

Studying the MLL1 gene and its oncogenic variants has provided a paradigm for understanding cancer initiation and maintenance through aberrant epigenetic gene regulation. Here we review the historical development of model systems to recapitulate oncogenic MLL1-rearrangement (MLL-r) alleles encoding mixed-lineage leukemia fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) or internal gene rearrangement products. These largely mouse and human cell/xenograft systems have been generated and used to understand how MLL-r alleles affect diverse pathways to result in a highly penetrant, drug-resistant leukemia. The particular features of the animal models influenced the conclusions of mechanisms of transformation. We discuss significant downstream enablers, inhibitors, effectors, and collaborators of MLL-r leukemia, including molecules that directly interact with MLL-FPs and endogenous mixed-lineage leukemia protein, direct target genes of MLL-FPs, and other pathways that have proven to be influential in supporting or suppressing the leukemogenic activity of MLL-FPs. The use of animal models has been complemented with patient sample, genome-wide analyses to delineate the important genomic and epigenomic changes that occur in distinct subsets of MLL-r leukemia. Collectively, these studies have resulted in rapid progress toward developing new strategies for targeting MLL-r leukemia and general cell-biological principles that may broadly inform targeting aberrant epigenetic regulators in other cancers.","['Li, Bin E', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Li BE', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; Department of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora, CO, USA.

Chronic basophilic leukemia (CBL) is an extremely rare type of leukemia with appearance of 7 cases in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73 year-old female patient who presented with weaknes, had a prolonged duration of hematologic remission after treatment of her CBL by hydroxyurea (HU). Evolution of SM occurring as a second neoplasia concurrently with relapse of de novo CBL was demonstrated by mast cells (MCs) infiltration in the bone marrow (BM) biopsy and smear and increase in tryptase level. Transformation to MCL with simultaneous occurrance of accelerated phase of CBL were documented by the appearance of MCs in both BM and peripheral blood (PB) smears, antigen expressions detected by flow cytometry and spesific stains. Sequence analysis of c-kit gene revealed c-kit exon 11 K550N mutation. Undefined associations of MCL with different mast cell morphology, increase in IL-6 level and accelerated phase of de novo CBL was described. CONCLUSION: Elevations in CRP and IL-6 levels occurring with increases in basophil counts to high levels revealed that febrile episodes with abdominal pain seen in our patient were induced by increase in IL-6 levels released from neoplastic basophils. Neoplastic basophils with diffuse and coarse basophilic granules possibly mimic neutrophils with toxic granules and cause wrong characterization of neoplastic basophils as neutrophils by the automated blood cell counters and misleaded physicians.","['Cehreli, Cavit', 'Alacacioglu, Inci', 'Piskin, Ozden', 'Ates, Halil', 'Cehreli, Ruksan', 'Calibasi, Gizem', 'Yuksel, Erdinc', 'Ozkal, Sermin', 'Ozsan, Guner H']","['Cehreli C', 'Alacacioglu I', 'Piskin O', 'Ates H', 'Cehreli R', 'Calibasi G', 'Yuksel E', 'Ozkal S', 'Ozsan GH']","['Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, 35330 Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, 35330 Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, 35330 Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, 35330 Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Institute of Oncology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Dokuz Eylul University Institute of Oncology, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Departments of Medical Biology and Genetics, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Institute of Pathology Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, 35330 Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140913,England,BMC Hematol,BMC hematology,101609487,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Basophilia', 'Dysplasia', 'Interleukin-6', 'Mast cell leukemia', 'Mastocytosis']",2014/09/30 06:00,2014/09/30 06:01,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2013/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2052-1839-14-17 [doi]', '28 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Hematol. 2014 Sep 13;14(1):17. doi: 10.1186/2052-1839-14-17. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4177064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, much effort has been devoted to the investigation of blocking Nrf2 function in cultured cells and cancer tissues, but few researches have been undertaken to evaluate the precise mechanism of flavonoids-induced sensitivity by inhibiting Nrf2. In this study, we investigated the reversal effect of Wogonin, a flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, in resistant human myelogenous leukemia. Data indicated that Wogonin had strong reversal potency by inhibiting functional activity and expression of MRP1 at both protein and mRNA in adriamycin (ADR)-induced resistant human myelogenous leukemia K562/A02 cells. Consequently, the inhibition of MRP1 by Wogonin was dependent on Nrf2 through the decreased binding ability of Nrf2 to antioxidant response element (ARE). Further research revealed Wogonin modulated Nrf2 through the reduction of Nrf2mRNA at transcriptional processes rather than RNA degradation, which is regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, DNA-PKcs was found to be involved in the Wogonin-induced downregulation of Nrf2 mRNA at transcriptional levels. In summary, these results clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of using Wogonin via inhibiting Nrf2 to combat chemoresistance and suggested that Wogonin can be developed into an efficient natural sensitizer for resistant human myelogenous leukemia.","['Xu, Xuefen', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Li, Wei', 'Miao, Hanchi', 'Zhang, Haiwei', 'Zhou, Yuxin', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'You, Qidong', 'Zhao, Li', 'Guo, Qinglong']","['Xu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Li W', 'Miao H', 'Zhang H', 'Zhou Y', 'Li Z', 'You Q', 'Zhao L', 'Guo Q']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.

We aimed to evaluate overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence in children who underwent AHSCT for MDS in six institutions from Argentina. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis of 54 AHSCT was carried out in 52 patients (mean age: 9 years; range: 2-19; 35 males). RESULTS: MDS subtypes were refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) (n: 26, 50%), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n: 9, 18%), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) (n: 8, 15%) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (n: 9, 17%). At time of transplant, seven (13%) patients transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and two patients with RCC to RAEB. Donors were related in 32 cases (59%) and the stem cells source was: bone marrow (63%), peripheral blood (26%), and umbilical cord blood (11%). Five-year DFS and OS were 50% and 55% respectively; and for patients with JMML, 57% and 67% respectively. Cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse were 27% and 21% respectively. In the multivariate analysis, umbilical cord blood (HR 4.07; P = 0.025) and age >/= 9 years at transplantation (HR 3.28; P = 0.017) were associated with lower OS; age and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) had a higher NRM. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, more than half of the patients achieved long term OS with AHSCT. Less toxic conditioning regimens or more intensive GVHD prophylaxis could lead to better results in some children.","['Basquiera, Ana L', 'Pizzi, Silvia', 'Correas, Agustin Gonzalez', 'Longo, Pablo G', 'Goldman, Wanda C', 'Prates, Maria V', 'Formisano, Sandra', 'Kusminisky, Gustavo', 'Feldman, Leonardo', 'Berretta, Adriana R', 'Garcia, Juan J', 'Staciuk, Raquel']","['Basquiera AL', 'Pizzi S', 'Correas AG', 'Longo PG', 'Goldman WC', 'Prates MV', 'Formisano S', 'Kusminisky G', 'Feldman L', 'Berretta AR', 'Garcia JJ', 'Staciuk R']","['Hospital Privado Centro Medico de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina; Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biomedicas de Cordoba (IUCBC), Cordoba, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140927,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['JMML', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'transplantation']",2014/09/30 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25238 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jan;62(1):153-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25238.

The contribution of local anesthetic with deep sedation is unknown. The objective was to evaluate EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream as a pain reliever in conjunction with propofol in the setting of routine lumbar punctures. PROCEDURE: We included patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 3-21 years requiring at least two routine lumbar punctures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive EMLA or placebo cream and the alternate treatment with the second procedure. Patients, personnel and outcome assessors were blinded to allocation. The primary outcome included three indirect measures of pain: total median propofol doses, patient movement and heart rate changes at the time of skin puncture in both treatment groups. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 25 were analyzed. With EMLA cream, 4 mg/kg (median) of propofol was required (95% CI 3.5-4.4). With placebo, 4.9 mg/kg of propofol was needed (95% CI 4.3-5.6; P = 0.008). When EMLA cream was applied, 8% of patients moved, whereas 84% moved with placebo cream (P < 0.0001). There was a lower average heart rate by seven beats in the EMLA treatment compared to placebo (95% CI -2.3-4.3; 4.1-12.4; P = 0.009). There were no adverse events in either treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the combination of EMLA cream with propofol is beneficial. Topical analgesics are at the discretion of the oncologist, allowing us to advocate for patients by providing safe and efficacious pain management for lumbar punctures.","['Whitlow, Puja G', 'Saboda, Kathylynn', 'Roe, Denise J', 'Bazzell, Susan', 'Wilson, Cera']","['Whitlow PG', 'Saboda K', 'Roe DJ', 'Bazzell S', 'Wilson C']","[""Division of Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140927,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anesthetics, Local)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anesthetics, Local/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Propofol/*therapeutic use', 'Spinal Puncture/*adverse effects', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['EMLA cream', 'cross over randomized trial', 'lumbar punctures', 'pediatric anesthesia', 'pediatric leukemia']",2014/09/30 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25236 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jan;62(1):85-90. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25236.

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in folding and functions as a chaperone for multiple client proteins, many of which are important in tumorigenesis. In this study, we examined NVP-AUY922 (AUY922), a second generation isoxazole-based non-geldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor, and confirmed its effects on survival of ATL-related cell lines. Analysis using FACS revealed that AUY922 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis; it also inhibited the growth of primary ATL cells, but not of normal PBMCs. AUY922 caused strong upregulation of HSP70, a surrogate marker of HSP90 inhibition, and a dose-dependent decrease in HSP90 client proteins associated with cell survival, proliferation, and cell cycle in the G1 phase, including phospho-Akt, Akt, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, IKKgamma, Cdk4, Cdk6, and survivin. Interestingly, AUY922 induced downregulation of the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) in ATL cells. The PIM family (PIM-1, -2, -3) is made up of oncogenes that encode a serine/threonine protein kinase family. As PIM kinases have multiple functions involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis, their downregulation could play an important role in AUY922-induced death of ATL cells. In fact, SGI-1776, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, successfully inhibited the growth of primary ATL cells as well as ATL-related cell lines. Our findings suggest that AUY922 is an effective therapeutic agent for ATL, and PIM kinases may be a novel therapeutic target.","['Taniguchi, Hiroaki', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Ando, Koji', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Uno, Naoki', 'Morinaga, Yoshitomo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Taniguchi H', 'Hasegawa H', 'Sasaki D', 'Ando K', 'Sawayama Y', 'Imanishi D', 'Taguchi J', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Hata T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Uno N', 'Morinaga Y', 'Yanagihara K', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan; Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan; Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141105,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0', '(5-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropylphenyl)-4-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethylphenyl)isoxazole-3-', 'carboxylic acid ethylamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Resorcinols)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Resorcinols/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', 'HSP90 inhibitors', 'NF-kappaB', 'NVP-AUY922', 'PIM kinases']",2014/09/30 06:00,2015/02/18 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12540 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Dec;105(12):1601-8. doi: 10.1111/cas.12540.

Plk1 is a marker of cellular proliferation and has prognostic potential in different types of human tumors. In a series of preclinical studies, Plk1 has been validated as a cancer target. This prompted many pharmaceutical companies to develop small-molecule inhibitors targeting the classical ATP-binding site of Plk1 for anticancer drug development. Recently, FDA has granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation to the Plk inhibitor BI 6727 (volasertib), which provided a survival benefit for patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. Remarkably, a new generation of Plk1 inhibitors that target the second druggable domain of Plk1, the Polo-box domain, is currently being tested preclinically. Since various ATP-competitive compounds of Plk1 inhibit also the activities of Plk2 and Plk3, which act as tumor suppressors, the roles of closely related Plk-family members in cancer cells need to be considered carefully. In this article, the authors highlight recent insights into the biology of Plks in cancer cells and discuss the progress in the development of small-molecule Plk1 inhibitors. The authors believe that the greatest therapeutic benefit might come through leukemic cells that are in direct contact with the inhibitor in the blood stream. The identification of biomarkers and studies that document Plk activities in treated patients would also be beneficial to better understand the role of Plk inhibition in tumor development and anticancer therapy.","['Strebhardt, Klaus', 'Becker, Sven', 'Matthess, Yves']","['Strebhardt K', 'Becker S', 'Matthess Y']","['J.W.

Outcomes of haploidentical transplantation have recently improved, and a comparison between donor sources in a uniform cohort of patients has not been performed. We evaluated outcomes of 227 patients with AML/MDS treated with melphalan-based conditioning. Donors were matched related (MRD) (n = 87, 38%), matched unrelated (MUD) (n = 108, 48%), or haploidentical (n = 32, 14%). No significant differences were found between haploidentical and MUD transplantation outcomes; however, there was a trend for improved outcomes in the MRD group, with 3-year progression-free survival for patients in remission of 57%, 45%, and 41% for MRD, MUD, and haploidentical recipients, respectively (P = .417). Recovery of T cell subsets was similar for all groups. These results suggest that haploidentical donors can safely extend transplantation for AML/MDS patients without an HLA-matched donor.

Identification of the substrates and corresponding kinases of the mutant PTPs may provide novel therapeutic targets for cancers harboring these mutant PTPs.","['Zhao, S', 'Sedwick, D', 'Wang, Z']","['Zhao S', 'Sedwick D', 'Wang Z']","['1] Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Shanghai Institution of Digestive Disease, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine Renji Hospital, Shanghai, China [2] Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA [3] Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', '1] Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA [2] Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', '1] Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA [2] Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20140929,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/09/30 06:00,2015/10/10 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014326 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.326 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jul 23;34(30):3885-94. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.326.

Here we investigated the expression of EZH2 by immunohistochemical staining in a wide range of T-cell neoplasms. We found that EZH2 is highly expressed in all categories of T-cell neoplasia studied, and its expression strongly correlates with a high proliferation rate. Although up-regulation of EZH2 has been reported to be modulated by the pSTAT3-MYC pathway, our data indicate that EZH2 expression is correlated with MYC and/or pSTAT3 expression in only a subset of T-cell lymphomas, and that other mechanisms may control the overexpression of EZH2 in many T-cell lymphomas. The high level of EZH2 expression in T cell lymphomas suggest that these neoplasms may benefit from targeted treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 currently in use in clinical trials.","['Shi, Min', 'Shahsafaei, Ali', 'Liu, Cuiling', 'Yu, Hongbo', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Shi M', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Liu C', 'Yu H', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141030,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['EZH2', 'MYC', 'T-cell lymphoma', 'pSTAT3', 'proliferation']",2014/09/30 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.968780 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Jul;56(7):2087-91. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.968780.

We previously described the impact of cytokine production on prognosis in paediatric standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: In this study, we investigated the influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNFalpha, TGFbeta, IL10 and IFNgamma) on frequency, risk group and prognosis in 95 paediatric ALL-patients. We further report on intracellular production of these cytokines in T-cells. RESULTS: IL10 high-producer-haplotypes were reduced in ALL-patients compared with healthy controls and resulted in a reduced relapse rate compared with low-producer haplotypes. TGFbeta high-producer-haplotypes were correlated with a high initial blast-count (codon 25: G/G) and were elevated in high-risk ALL-patients (codon 10: T/T). IL10 was positively and IFNgamma-production was negatively correlated with initial blast-count. At diagnosis the expression of TNFalpha and IFNgamma was reduced in patients compared with healthy controls. This was more pronounced in high-risk and in T-ALL-patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that gene-polymorphisms of the regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, TGFbeta and IL10, but not of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNgamma and TNFalpha, have an impact on prognosis and risk-group of ALL. However, the reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines at diagnosis may serve as another important, functional risk factor. These data may help in further risk stratification and adaptation of therapy-intensity in paediatric patients with ALL.","['Winkler, B', 'Taschik, J', 'Haubitz, I', 'Eyrich, M', 'Schlegel, P G', 'Wiegering, V']","['Winkler B', 'Taschik J', 'Haubitz I', 'Eyrich M', 'Schlegel PG', 'Wiegering V']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Wurzburg, Children's Hospital, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140927,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'cytokine', 'paediatric', 'polymorphism', 'prognosis']",2014/09/30 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/30 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25142 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jan;62(1):72-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25142.

PROCEDURE: HSCTs performed in patients with DS-ALL were identified in the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation registry. RESULTS: In the registry data, 11 patients with DS-ALL were identified. The median age at HSCT was 9 years (range: 6-22 years). Six patients underwent HSCT at non-remission status. Allogeneic grafts were utilized in all patients, including eight patients who received HSCT from unrelated donors. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens were used in three patients. All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment by a median of day 18 (range: day 11-61). Ten patients experienced grade 3 or more infectious episodes. Six patients experienced complications of the respiratory system. The incidences of II-IV or III-IV acute GVHD were nine (81.8%) or seven patients (63.6%), respectively. Chronic GVHD was observed in five (55.6%) out of nine evaluable patients. Seven patients died at a median of 6 months (range: 0-24 months) after HSCT. Two-year relapse-free and overall survival were 33.3% (95% CI: 2.5-64.1%) or 37.5% (95% CI: 5.9-69.1%), respectively.

In addition, it was also proved that as a kind of cancer suppressor gene, miR-199a-3p in miRNA can affect the growth and invasion ability of tumor cells. This paper aims to discuss the effect of miRNA to osteosarcoma cell. It used synthetic mature miR-199a-3p sequence simulants to transfect osteosarcoma cell and took negative contrast sequence (NC mimics) transfection cell as negative contrast. After transfection, qRT-PCR was applied to detect the expression quantity of miR-199a-3p in every group. Western blot method was applied to detect the expression level of MCL-(1) protein and shear situation of PARP in groups of cells. Flow cytometry was used for detecting apoptosis rate of cells and the experimental result was made a statistical analysis. The result shows that in cells from experimental group of transfection miR-199a-3p sequence simulants, expression quantity of mi-R-199a-3p significantly increased while MCL(-)(1) protein expression decreased compared to control group. In addition, shear level of PARP protein and apoptosis rate of cells increased. The differences all had statistical significance (P<0.05). It was concluded that miR-199a-3p can effectively promote the apoptosis rate of osteosarcoma cells.","['Tian, Ke', 'Wang, Limin', 'Di, Ruiqing', 'Xu, Jianzhong', 'Li, Guangheng', 'Li, Zhifu']","['Tian K', 'Wang L', 'Di R', 'Xu J', 'Li G', 'Li Z']","['Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.', 'TheOtolaryngologicalDepartment, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,Pak J Pharm Sci,Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,9426356,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (mirn199 microRNA, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/analysis', 'Osteosarcoma/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/analysis']",,,2014/09/30 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2014/09/29 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pak J Pharm Sci. 2014 Sep;27(5 Suppl):1657-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, A3 mutational activity may induce undesired genomic damage and enable HIV-1 to evade drugs and immune responses. Here, we show that A3A protein from Colobus guereza (colA3A) can restrict HIV-1 replication in producer cells in a deaminase-independent manner without inducing DNA damage. Neither HIV-1 reverse transcription nor integration were significantly affected by colA3A, but capsid protein synthesis was inhibited. The determinants for colA3A restriction mapped to the N-terminal region. These properties extend to A3A from mandrills and De Brazza's monkeys. Surprisingly, truncated colA3A proteins expressing only the N-terminal 100 amino acids effectively exclude critical catalytic regions but retained potent cellular restriction activity. These highlight a unique mechanism of cellular HIV-1 restriction by several Old World monkey A3A proteins that may be exploited for functional HIV-1 cure strategies.","['Katuwal, Miki', 'Wang, Yaqiong', 'Schmitt, Kimberly', 'Guo, Kejun', 'Halemano, Kalani', 'Santiago, Mario L', 'Stephens, Edward B']","['Katuwal M', 'Wang Y', 'Schmitt K', 'Guo K', 'Halemano K', 'Santiago ML', 'Stephens EB']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Blvd., Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Blvd., Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Blvd., Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Blvd., Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.

However, alternative geranylgeranylation has been postulated as an escape mechanism by which RAS bypasses the effect of FTI treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, augments the cytotoxic effect of tipifarnib by blocking the alternative geranylgeranylation of RAS. Notably, this effect was accompanied by disruption of RAS membrane localization and ERK downregulation. In addition, the apoptotic effect of this combination was associated with downregulation of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein and activation of the caspase cascade. These findings demonstrate that combining tipifarnib and simvastatin was successful in targeting RAS/ERK signaling and inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. Both simvastatin and tipifarnib were used at clinically achievable doses, which make the combination promising for future clinical studies.","['Ahmed, Tamer A', 'Hayslip, John', 'Leggas, Markos']","['Ahmed TA', 'Hayslip J', 'Leggas M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA; Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA; Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.

Down-regulating CD44 could be clinically relevant not only for suppression of the deregulated function of LSPC but also in LSPC response to chemotherapeutic agents. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery is a promising approach for AML treatment, and we recently reported effective siRNA delivery into difficult-to-transfect AML cell lines using lipid-substituted polyethylenimine/siRNA complexes (polymeric nanoparticles). In this study, we investigated polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 in CD34+ LSPC cell models (leukemic KG-1 and KG-1a cell lines) as well as primary AML cells. Polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing decreased surface CD44 levels in KG-1, KG-1a and primary AML cells by up to 27%, 30% and 20% at day 3, respectively. Moreover, CD44 silencing resulted in induction of apoptosis in KG-1 cells, reduced adhesion of KG-1 and KG-1a cells to hyaluronic acid-coated cell culture plates and BM-MSC, and decreased adhesion of primary AML cells to BM-MSC. Our results suggest that polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 might be a useful technique for inhibiting LSPC interactions with their microenvironment, thereby prohibiting leukemia progression or sensitizing LSPC to chemotherapy.","['Gul-Uludag, Hilal', 'Valencia-Serna, Juliana', 'Kucharski, Cezary', 'Marquez-Curtis, Leah A', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Larratt, Loree', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, Anna', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Gul-Uludag H', 'Valencia-Serna J', 'Kucharski C', 'Marquez-Curtis LA', 'Jiang X', 'Larratt L', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Uludag H']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Accumulation of beta-catenin by inhibition or knockout of its negative regulator GSK3 is known to sustain pluripotency in conjunction with other factors. However, dual function of beta-catenin and context-dependence of its activities make it difficult to dissect the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. beta-Catenin transactivation function, which is considered to be associated with Wnt signaling, proved to be largely dispensable for the self-renewal of naive embryonic stem cells, but required for differentiation. Instead, beta-catenin-mediated adhesion is beneficial for self-renewal, though presumably its main role is to stabilize LIF/STAT3 pathway rather than to maintain intercellular contacts per se. Yet recent report implicates E-cadherin-independent cytoplasm activity of beta-catenin in pluripotency maintenance. This review focuses on the new data concerning adhesion- and transcription-related activities of beta-catenin in control of self-renewal versus differentiation in pluripotent stem cells, as well as analyzing binding partners of beta-catenin in embryonic stem cells, which include key pluripotency regulators.","['Sineva, Galina S', 'Pospelov, Valery A']","['Sineva GS', 'Pospelov VA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia; Department of Cytology and Histology, Biological Faculty, St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: A higher prevalence of the C allele was found in CLL, CML and AML patients. However, there were no statistically significant differences regarding either the genotype or the allelic frequencies of the -174G/C polymorphism between CLL, CML and AML cases.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain such an apparently high mutational load. However, the mechanisms by which deleterious mutations in some genes cause a pathological effect but are apparently innocuous in other genes remain largely unknown. This study searched for deleterious variants in the 1,000 genomes populations, as well as in a newly sequenced population of 252 healthy Spanish individuals. In addition, variants causative of monogenic diseases and somatic variants from 41 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients were analysed. The deleterious variants found were analysed in the context of the interactome to understand the role of network topology in the maintenance of the observed mutational load. Our results suggest that one of the mechanisms whereby the effect of these deleterious variants on the phenotype is suppressed could be related to the configuration of the protein interaction network. Most of the deleterious variants observed in healthy individuals are concentrated in peripheral regions of the interactome, in combinations that preserve their connectivity, and have a marginal effect on interactome integrity. On the contrary, likely pathogenic cancer somatic deleterious variants tend to occur in internal regions of the interactome, often with associated structural consequences. Finally, variants causative of monogenic diseases seem to occupy an intermediate position. Our observations suggest that the real pathological potential of a variant might be more a systems property rather than an intrinsic property of individual proteins.","['Garcia-Alonso, Luz', 'Jimenez-Almazan, Jorge', 'Carbonell-Caballero, Jose', 'Vela-Boza, Alicia', 'Santoyo-Lopez, Javier', 'Antinolo, Guillermo', 'Dopazo, Joaquin']","['Garcia-Alonso L', 'Jimenez-Almazan J', 'Carbonell-Caballero J', 'Vela-Boza A', 'Santoyo-Lopez J', 'Antinolo G', 'Dopazo J']","['Computational Genomics Department, Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe (CIPF), Valencia, Spain.', 'Computational Genomics Department, Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe (CIPF), Valencia, Spain Bioinformatics of Rare Diseases (BIER), CIBER de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'Computational Genomics Department, Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe (CIPF), Valencia, Spain.', 'Medical Genome Project, Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform of Andalusia (GBPA), Seville, Spain.', 'Medical Genome Project, Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform of Andalusia (GBPA), Seville, Spain.', 'Medical Genome Project, Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform of Andalusia (GBPA), Seville, Spain Department of Genetics, Reproduction and Fetal Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio/Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/University of Seville, Seville, Spain Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Seville, Spain.', 'Computational Genomics Department, Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe (CIPF), Valencia, Spain Bioinformatics of Rare Diseases (BIER), CIBER de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain Medical Genome Project, Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform of Andalusia (GBPA), Seville, Spain Functional Genomics Node, (INB) at CIPF, Valencia, Spain jdopazo@cipf.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140926,England,Mol Syst Biol,Molecular systems biology,101235389,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Exome', 'Gene Library', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genetics, Population', '*Genome, Human', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Whites/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['exome sequencing', 'interactome', 'mutational load', 'network analysis', 'robustness']",2014/09/28 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2014/09/28 06:00'],"['2014/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.15252/msb.20145222 [doi]'],epublish,Mol Syst Biol. 2014 Sep 26;10:752. doi: 10.15252/msb.20145222.,['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Data have been limited, however, on the use of medium- to high-energy beta-emitting radionuclides of interest for cancer imaging and treatment. We assessed the use of CLI as an adjunct to determine localization of radioimmunoconjugates to hematolymphoid tissues. Radiolabeled (177)Lu- or (90)Y-anti-CD45 antibody (Ab; DOTA-30F11) was administered by tail vein injection to athymic mice bearing disseminated murine myeloid leukemia, with CLI images acquired at times afterward. Gamma counting of individual organs showed preferential uptake in CD45(+) tissues with significant retention of radiolabeled Ab in sites of leukemia (spleen and bone marrow). This result was confirmed in CLI images with 1.35 x 10(5) +/- 2.2 x 10(4) p/s/cm(2)/sr and 3.45 x 10(3) +/- 7.0 x 10(2) p/s/cm(2)/sr for (90)Y-DOTA-30F11 and (177)Lu-DOTA-30F11, respectively, compared with undetectable signal for both radionuclides using the nonbinding control Ab. Results showed that CLI allows for in vivo visualization of localized beta-emissions. Pixel intensity variability resulted from differences in absorbed doses of the associated energies of the beta-emitting radionuclide. Overall, our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for the use of CLI techniques in tandem with currently available clinical diagnostic tools.","['Balkin, Ethan R', 'Kenoyer, Aimee', 'Orozco, Johnnie J', 'Hernandez, Alexandra', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Fisher, Darrell R', 'Green, Damian J', 'Hylarides, Mark D', 'Press, Oliver W', 'Wilbur, D Scott', 'Pagel, John M']","['Balkin ER', 'Kenoyer A', 'Orozco JJ', 'Hernandez A', 'Shadman M', 'Fisher DR', 'Green DJ', 'Hylarides MD', 'Press OW', 'Wilbur DS', 'Pagel JM']","['Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.

A Monte Carlo simulation was performed using a previously published population pharmacokinetic model. The following dosing scenarios were evaluated: 200 mg loading dose (LD) on Day 1 then 100 mg daily (manufacturer's recommended dosing regimen); 200 mg LD on Day 1 then 100 mg every 48 h (q48 h); and 200 mg q48 h, 200 mg every 72 h (q72 h) and 300 mg q72 h. For each dosing regimen, free drug concentrations were calculated to evaluate the effect of 99% protein binding. The PTA at various pharmacodynamic (PD) targets was determined as the percentage of subjects who achieved a free drug area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (fAUC/MIC) or a free drug maximum plasma concentration over the minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (fC(max)/MIC) above the PD targets. PTA expectation values were then calculated for each dosing regimen. The currently recommended dosing regimen of anidulafungin was not optimal for invasive candidiasis in patients with acute leukaemia. Alternate dosing strategies with higher doses and extended dosing intervals (intermittent dosing) achieved better target attainment. This is the first study to optimise therapy with anidulafungin using Monte Carlo simulation. These results provide a rationale in support of future clinical investigation of intermittent dosing of anidulafungin.","['Doan, Tan N', 'Kong, David C M', 'Patel, Kashyap', 'Walker, Patricia', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Kirkpatrick, Carl M J']","['Doan TN', 'Kong DC', 'Patel K', 'Walker P', 'Spencer A', 'Kirkpatrick CM']","['Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.

The other 23 patients (8%) could not be classified specifically. The distribution of childhood MDS in Japan according to the French-American-British subclassification was similar to that in other countries. However, we identified a higher incidence of therapy-related cases. As for relationship between cytogenetics and prognoses, abnormal karyotypes were related to poorer prognoses than normal karyotype (P < 0.01). However, patients with trisomy 8 had prognoses comparable to those with normal karyotypes. Complex karyotypes were associated with poorer prognoses among RAEB and RAEBt patients. In conclusion, prognosis of pediatric MDS is related to cytogenetics. A more precise diagnosis and classification system is needed for childhood MDS.","['Moriwaki, Koichi', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Moriwaki K', 'Manabe A', 'Taketani T', 'Kikuchi A', 'Nakahata T', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140927,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2014/09/28 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/09/28 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1674-z [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Nov;100(5):478-84. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1674-z.

In order to ascertain whether the frequencies and patterns of submicroscopic changes, identifiable with single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, differ between childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of 126 adult cases, the largest series to date, including 18 paired diagnostic and relapse samples. Apart from identifying characteristic microdeletions of the CDKN2A, EBF1, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5 and RB1 genes, the present study uncovered novel, focal deletions of the BCAT1, BTLA, NR3C1, PIK3AP1 and SERP2 genes in 2-6% of the adult cases. IKZF1 deletions were associated with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P=0.036), BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P<0.001), and higher white blood cell counts (P=0.005). In addition, recurrent deletions of RASSF3 and TOX were seen in relapse samples. Comparing paired diagnostic/relapse samples revealed identical changes at diagnosis and relapse in 27%, clonal evolution in 22%, and relapses evolving from ancestral clones in 50%, akin to what has previously been reported in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and indicating that the mechanisms of relapse may be similar in adult and childhood cases.

SGI-110 is a novel hypomethylating dinucleotide with prolonged in vivo exposure and clinical activity in patients with MDS and AML. We demonstrate that this agent, like decitabine, produces robust re-expression of the CTAs NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A, both in vitro and in leukemia-bearing AML xenografts. Upregulation of these genes in vitro was sufficient to induce cytotoxicity by HLA-compatible CD8+ T-cells specific for NY-ESO-1, a well-recognized and immunogenic CTA. Additionally, exposure to SGI-110 enhances MHC class I and co-stimulatory molecule expression, potentially contributing to recognition of CTAs.

However, the prognostic impact of gene mutations in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical implications of 8 gene mutations in 325 adult AML patients; 100 of them received allo-HSCT and 225 did not. The genetic alterations analyzed included NPM1, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, CEBPA, RUNX1, RAS, MLL-PTD, and WT1. In patients who did not receive allo-HSCT, older age, higher WBC count, higher lactate dehydrogenase level, unfavorable karyotype, and RUNX1 mutation were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS), while CEBPA double mutation (CEBPA(double-mut)) and NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg) were associated with good outcome. However, in patients who received allo-HSCT, only refractory disease status at the time of HSCT and unfavorable karyotype were independent poor prognostic factors. Surprisingly, RUNX1 mutation was an independent good prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis. The prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD or NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg) was lost in this group of patients receiving allo-HSCT, while CEBPA(double-mut) showed a trend to be a good prognostic factor. In conclusion, allo-HSCT can ameliorate the unfavorable influence of some poor-risk gene mutations in AML patients. Unexpectedly, the RUNX1 mutation showed a favorable prognostic impact in the context of allo-HSCT. These results need to be confirmed by further studies with more AML patients.","['Chou, Sheng-Chieh', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hu, Fu-Chang', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Yao, Ming', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chou SC', 'Tang JL', 'Hou HA', 'Chou WC', 'Hu FC', 'Chen CY', 'Yao M', 'Ko BS', 'Huang SY', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

In association with myeloid neoplasms, the clinical course is aggressive, and in absence of effective conventional treatment options, long-term remission is usually only observed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). With the discovery of inhibitors of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase and based on encouraging in vitro and in vivo data, we treated two male patients with myeloid neoplasms and a PCM1-JAK2 or a BCR-JAK2 fusion gene, respectively, with the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. After 12 months of treatment, both patients achieved a complete clinical, hematologic, and cytogenetic response. Non-hematologic toxicity was only grade 1 while no hematologic toxicity was observed.

In a cell-free assay, compound 1 inhibited TACE enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, compound 1 inhibited the production of soluble TNF-alpha in human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells without impacting nitric oxide production, and exhibited anti-proliferative activity against THP-1 cells.

XMRV is representative of an early founder virus that jumps species from mouse to human cell lines. Relatively little information is available concerning the XMRV integrase (IN), an enzyme that catalyzes a key stage in the retroviral cycle, and whose sequence is conserved among replication competent retroviruses emerging from recombination between the murine endogenous PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 genomes. Previous studies have shown that IN inhibitors efficiently block XMRV multiplication in cells. We thus aimed at characterizing the biochemical properties and sensitivity of the XMRV IN to the raltegravir, dolutegravir, 118-D-24 and elvitegravir inhibitors in vitro. We report for the first time the purification and enzymatic characterization of recombinant XMRV IN. This IN, produced in Escherichia coli and purified under native conditions, is optimally active over a pH range of 7-8.5, in the presence of Mg(2+) (15 mM and 30 mM for 3'-processing and strand transfer, respectively) and is poorly sensitive to the addition of dithiothreitol. Raltegravir was shown to be a very potent inhibitor (IC50 approximately 30 nM) whereas dolutegravir and elvitegravir were less effective (IC50 approximately 230 nM and 650 nM, respectively). The 118-D-24 drug had no impact on XMRV IN activity. Interestingly, the substrate specificity of XMRV IN seems to be less marked compared to HIV-1 IN since XMRV IN is able to process various donor substrates that share little homology. Finally, our analysis revealed some original properties of the XMRV IN such as its relatively low sequence specificity.","['Mbemba, Gladys', 'Henry, Etienne', 'Delelis, Olivier', 'Bouger, Marie-Christine', 'Buckle, Malcolm', 'Mouscadet, Jean-Francois', 'Hazan, Uriel', 'Leh, Herve', 'Bury-Mone, Stephanie']","['Mbemba G', 'Henry E', 'Delelis O', 'Bouger MC', 'Buckle M', 'Mouscadet JF', 'Hazan U', 'Leh H', 'Bury-Mone S']","['LBPA, CNRS, Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) de Cachan, 61 avenue du President Wilson, 94235 Cachan, France.

Recent studies have shown that EMMPRIN overexpression indicates poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, little was known on the role of EMMPRIN in leukemia. Human leukemia cell line U937 was stably transfected with a EMMPRIN-targeted shRNA-containing vector to investigate the effect of EMMPRIN on cellular functions. EMMPRIN expression was monitored by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell viability and proliferation were determined by trypan blue exclusion and BrdU labeling, respectively. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin on cells was assessed by MTT assay. Knockdown of EMMPRIN gene significantly inhibited cell viability and decreased cell proliferation. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis revealed that the reduced EMMPRIN expression resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, western blotting analysis showed that EMMPRIN knockdown was associated with downregulation of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related molecules including cyclin D1, cyclin E, as well as increase in cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. This study also showed that silencing of EMMPRIN sensitized U937 cells to Adriamycin.

Best examples are clear cell renal cancer, adenocarcinoma of the prostate or transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. This new knowledge helps in the differential diagnostics of cancer, and in determining prognosis, but also provides an opportunity to better tailor existing therapies even to consider novel target agents.

While most human cancers express telomerase activity, approximately 10%-15% employ a recombination-dependent telomere maintenance pathway known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) that is characterized by multitelomere clusters and associated promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies. Here, we show that a DNA double-strand break (DSB) response at ALT telomeres triggers long-range movement and clustering between chromosome termini, resulting in homology-directed telomere synthesis. Damaged telomeres initiate increased random surveillance of nuclear space before displaying rapid directional movement and association with recipient telomeres over micron-range distances. This phenomenon required Rad51 and the Hop2-Mnd1 heterodimer, which are essential for homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis. These findings implicate a specialized homology searching mechanism in ALT-dependent telomere maintenance and provide a molecular basis underlying the preference for recombination between nonsister telomeres during ALT.","['Cho, Nam Woo', 'Dilley, Robert L', 'Lampson, Michael A', 'Greenberg, Roger A']","['Cho NW', 'Dilley RL', 'Lampson MA', 'Greenberg RA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA; Department of Pathology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA; Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Basser Research Center for BRCA, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA.

We included 1024 cases aged <15, diagnosed with leukemia during 1968-1991, from the Danish Cancer Registry and 2048 controls randomly selected from the Danish childhood population and individually matched by gender and year of birth. We used geographical information systems to determine the distance between residence at birth and the nearest 132-400 kV overhead power line. Concentrations of domestic radon and traffic-related air pollution (NOx at the front door) were estimated using validated models. We found a statistically significant interaction between distance to nearest power line and domestic radon regarding risk of childhood leukemia (p = 0.01) when using the median radon level as cut-off point but not when using the 75th percentile (p = 0.90). We found no evidence of an interaction between distance to nearest power line and traffic-related air pollution (p = 0.73). We found almost no change in the estimated association between distance to power line and risk of childhood leukemia when adjusting for socioeconomic status of the municipality, urbanization, maternal age, birth order, domestic radon and traffic-related air pollution. The statistically significant interaction between distance to nearest power line and domestic radon was based on few exposed cases and controls and sensitive to the choice of exposure categorization and might, therefore, be due to chance.","['Pedersen, Camilla', 'Brauner, Elvira V', 'Rod, Naja H', 'Albieri, Vanna', 'Andersen, Claus E', 'Ulbak, Kaare', 'Hertel, Ole', 'Johansen, Christoffer', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole']","['Pedersen C', 'Brauner EV', 'Rod NH', 'Albieri V', 'Andersen CE', 'Ulbak K', 'Hertel O', 'Johansen C', 'Schuz J', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O']","['Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen O, Denmark; Danish Building Research Institute, Aalborg University, Construction and Health, Copenhagen SV, Denmark.', 'Social Medicine Section, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen K, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Riso National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy, Radiation Research Division, Technical University of Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'National Institute of Radiation Protection, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University, Roskilde, Denmark; Department for Environmental, Social and Spatial Change (ENSPAC), Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen O, Denmark; Oncology Clinic, Finsen Centre, Rigshospitalet 5073, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen O, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140926,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Air Pollution/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Electric Wiring/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Radon/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics', '*Risk', 'Risk Factors']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107096 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-02935 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 26;9(9):e107096. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107096. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4178021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to their normal counterpart, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), LSC possess self-renewal capacity and are responsible for the continued growth and proliferation of the bulk of leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. It is believed that LSC are also the root cause for the treatment failure and relapse of AML because LSC are often resistant to chemotherapy. In the past decade, we have made significant advancement in identification and understanding the molecular biology of LSC, but it remains a daunting task to specifically targeting LSC, while sparing normal HSC. In this review, we will first provide a historical overview of the discovery of LSC, followed by a summary of identification and separation of LSC by either cell surface markers or functional assays. Next, the review will focus on the current, various strategies for eradicating LSC.

The outcomes of alternative transplantation for acute leukemia were compared to other traditional graft sources. For patients lacking a matched sibling or unrelated donor, either strategy is a suitable option.

The objective of the study was to assess the clinical relevance of NPM1 and CEBPA mutations in AML. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis was based on 60 newly diagnosed patients with AML and normal/no metaphases karyotype and known mutation status, who were treated in our centre between 2008 and 2011 according to the PALG (Polish Adult Leukaemia Group) study protocol. Pretreatment bone marrow samples were studied by G-banding analysis, and NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3-ITD mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: NPM1 mutations were detected in 21 AML patients (35%). In the NPM1-positive subgroup, the FLT3-ITD mutation was observed in 3 cases (14%), which was significantly less frequent than in the NPM1-negative patients, where FLT3-ITD was detected in 16 cases (41%; p = 0.04). Among the CEBPA-positive population (n = 11; 18%), none of the studied patients had FLT3-ITD mutation, whereas it was detected in 19 CEBPA-negative patients (0% vs. 38%; p = 0.01). The highest complete remission rate was reported for the NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative group (n = 18; 88%) and the CEBPA-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative group (n = 8; 73%). For OS, multivariable analysis revealed NPM1-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative (HR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.19-0.63) and CEBPA-positive/FLT3-ITD-negative (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19-0.63) as favourable prognostic factors. The presence of the NPM1-negative/FLT3-ITD-positivecombination predicted adverse overall survival (HR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.13-3.66).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 antibodies and associated risk factors for HTLV-1 infection among pregnant women in University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, southeast Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from July to October 2010. Two hundred pregnant women were recruited consecutively from the antenatal clinic. Five milliliters of blood was collected from each of the participants into a plain sterile bottle and allowed to clot. The serum obtained was stored at -20 degrees C until required for analysis. The serum samples were then analyzed for antibodies to HTLV-1 using a one-step incubation double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Participants' demographic characteristics and degree of exposure to the risk factors associated with HTLV-1 infection were captured using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis of results was done using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: The average age of the pregnant women was 28.94 years (standard deviation 4.17). The age-group with the highest representation was those between the ages of 26 and 30 years. Thirty-six percent of the population was above 30 years old. The result of the tests showed that only one respondent, a 31-year-old pregnant woman tested positive for HTLV-1 antibodies. Therefore, the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 antibodies among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital was 0.5%, with a 95% confidence interval of 0%-2.8%. Some of the sociodemographic risk factors of HTLV-1 infection found to be applicable to the 31-year-old woman who tested positive included positive history of previous sexually transmitted diseases, high parity, low socioeconomic status, female sex, and age above 30 years. The pregnant women that participated in this study were exposed to risk factors and behaviors associated with HTLV-1 infection.

DATA SOURCES: A Pubmed literature search (January 1969 to June 2014) for articles written about AML and pregnancy, and bibliographies/citations of previously published reviews. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles written in the English language that administered active AML chemotherapy during pregnancy were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighty-five fetuses were exposed to chemotherapy from 83 mothers: 8 mothers began induction chemotherapy in the first trimester, 61 mothers in the second trimester, and 14 mothers in the third trimester. Chemotherapy resulted in more fetal deaths and spontaneous abortions during the first trimester (37.5%) compared with the second (9.7%) and third trimesters (0%). All cases included cytarabine; 47 fetuses were exposed to daunorubicin and 8 fetuses to idarubicin. The percentages of fetal defects and death for cytarabine and daunorubicin combinations were 8.5% and 6.4%, respectively. With cytarabine and idarubicin combinations, the percentages of fetal defects and death were 28.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Complete remission (CR) rates were 100%, 81%, and 67% in the first, second, and third trimesters. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment during the second and third trimesters resulted in fewer fetal complications than the first trimester. However, delaying AML treatment may adversely affect the mother's outcomes. In the reported cases, induction during pregnancy resulted in CR rates comparable to that in nonpregnant patients. The choice of anthracycline is still unclear, but the decision should be made with careful consideration, weighing the outcomes for the mother and fetus.","['Chang, Abraham', 'Patel, Samit']","['Chang A', 'Patel S']","['Stanford Health Care, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Stanford Health Care, Palo Alto, CA, USA SaPatel@stanfordhealthcare.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140925,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'pregnancy']",2014/09/27 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1060028014552516 [pii]', '10.1177/1060028014552516 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2015 Jan;49(1):48-68. doi: 10.1177/1060028014552516.

Association of the retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA) coreceptor to PML/RARA is required for transformation, with RXRA promoting its efficient DNA binding. APL is exquisitely sensitive to retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide (arsenic), which both trigger cell differentiation in vivo. Whereas RA elicits transcriptional activation of PML/RARA targets, how arsenic triggers differentiation remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that extinction of PML/RARA triggers terminal differentiation in vivo. Similarly, ablation of retinoid X receptors loosens PML/RARA DNA binding, inducing terminal differentiation of APL cells ex vivo or in vivo. RXRA sumoylation directly contributes to PML/RARA-dependent transformation ex vivo, presumably by enhancing transcriptional repression. Thus, APL differentiation is a default program triggered by clearance of PML/RARA-bound promoters, rather than obligatory active transcriptional activation, explaining how arsenic elicits APL maturation through PML/RARA degradation.","['Vitaliano-Prunier, Adeline', 'Halftermeyer, Juliane', 'Ablain, Julien', 'de Reynies, Aurelien', 'Peres, Laurent', 'Le Bras, Morgane', 'Metzger, Daniel', 'de The, Hugues']","['Vitaliano-Prunier A', 'Halftermeyer J', 'Ablain J', 'de Reynies A', 'Peres L', 'Le Bras M', 'Metzger D', 'de The H']","[""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France;"", ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France;"", ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France;"", ""Programme Cartes d'Identite des Tumeurs, Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Paris, France;"", ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France;"", ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France;"", 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7104, INSERM U 964, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France;', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Biochimie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France; and College de France, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39586-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-561852 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 11;124(25):3772-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-561852.

Previous studies have shown that an oral PI3K p110delta inhibitor idelalisib exhibits promising activity in CLL. Here, we demonstrate that a dual PI3K p110delta and p110gamma inhibitor, IPI-145, antagonizes BCR crosslinking activated prosurvival signals in primary CLL cells. IPI-145 causes direct killing in primary CLL cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, but does not generate direct cytotoxicity to normal B cells. However, IPI-145 does reduce the viability of normal T and natural killer cells and decrease activated T-cell production of various inflammatory and antiapoptotic cytokines. Furthermore, IPI-145 overcomes the ibrutinib resistance resulting from treatment-induced BTK C481S mutation. Collectively, these studies provide rationale for ongoing clinical evaluation of IPI-145 as a targeted therapy for CLL and related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Dong, Shuai', 'Guinn, Daphne', 'Dubovsky, Jason A', 'Zhong, Yiming', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Kutok, Jeffery', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Dong S', 'Guinn D', 'Dubovsky JA', 'Zhong Y', 'Lehman A', 'Kutok J', 'Woyach JA', 'Byrd JC', 'Johnson AJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, College of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Infinity Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140925,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '610V23S0JI (duvelisib)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CG protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39610-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-07-587279 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Dec 4;124(24):3583-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-07-587279.

The anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab induces remission, which requires consolidation by stem cell transplantation in eligible patients. In this case series, three chemotherapy-naive T-PLL patients received alemtuzumab for remission induction and allogeneic SCT after reduced-intensity conditioning. While primary hematopoietic engraftment occurred in a timely fashion, donor chimerism declined in all patients between day 28 and day 290 post-transplantation. Loss of chimerism was not associated with disease recurrence, and full chimerisms were regained on donor leukocyte infusion. In six B-CLL patients, treated with identical regimens of alemtuzumab and SCT, a similar pattern of failing chimerism was not observed.

Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for UVR quintiles using Poisson regression.

Some B-cell lymphomas (CLL/SLL, FL and Burkitt) suggested significant inverse relationships in whites and Hispanics, but not in blacks. Some T-cell lymphomas suggested the most reduced risk for the highest quintile of UVR among blacks (PNOS and MF/SS), though trends were not significant.

Standard diagnostic methods are cytomorphology (CM) and cytogenetics (CG). Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is upcoming in MDS diagnostic work up, comparability and investigator experience are critical. Myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) in myelomonocytic cells might be expressed more weakly in patients with MDS. The analysis of MNDA may thus improve diagnostic capabilities of MFC in MDS. Methods: Staining methods and antibody combinations for MFC in MDS are outlined, giving details for interpretation of results in regard to dyspoiesis. MFC results are correlated with CM and CG and with survival data. Use of myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) in MDS diagnostics was evaluated in 239 patients with MDS, AML, other cytopenic conditions and in 30 negative controls. Results: Strong correlation between findings in CM and MFC was found; MFC results correlated well with those of CG. Patients with higher grades of dysplasia in MFC had shorter overall survival. Percentages of granulocytes and monocytes with diminished MNDA expression (%dimG, %dimM) were higher in patients with MDS and AML. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MNDA in monocytes was lower in MDS and AML. Cut-off values for %dimG (12%) and %dimM (22%) as well as for MFI in monocytes (72) were defined discriminating between MDS and non-MDS. Conclusion: MFC adds significant information on dyspoiesis in the diagnostic work up for MDS and provides prognostic information. MNDA expression can be assessed by MFC and may facilitate evaluation of dyspoiesis when added to MDS MFC panels.

Consequently, it is also recognized as an end-point biomarker of therapeutic outcome for different treatment modalities in cancer. In this study we aimed to evaluate the expression and localization of cyclin D1 in arsenic trioxide (ATO) treated Jurkat cells (lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) and to correlate these results with the extent of cell death and/or cell cycle alterations. Jurkat cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ATO (0.2, 0.6 and 1.0muM) for 24h in standard cell culture conditions. To reach our goal we performed annexin V/PI labeling for detection of cell death and RNase/PI labeling for evaluation of cell cycle distribution, which were followed by the respective flow cytometric analyses of ATO-treated Jurkat cells. Transmission electron microscopy was applied for visualization of the cell ultrastructure. For cyclin D1 estimation a biparametric cyclinD1/cell cycle assay was done and localization of the protein was shown after immuno-labeling using light microscopy (ABC procedure) and confocal fluorescence microscopy. We found that there were no significant changes in the percentages of cyclin D1-positive cells after the treatment with ATO, but at the same time mean fluorescence intensity reflecting cyclin D1 content was gradually increasing along with the cell cycle progression, irrespective of the applied dose of the drug. On the other hand, we found a nuclear-cytoplasmic shift of this protein as a major treatment-related response, which was in good accord with an increased rate of cell death and suggested that cyclin D1 cytoplasmic degradation is an important determinant of the therapeutic efficiency of ATO in the Jurkat cell line.","['Zuryn, Agnieszka', 'Litwiniec, Anna', 'Gagat, Maciej', 'Drzewucka, Joanna', 'Gackowska, Lidia', 'Grzanka, Alina']","['Zuryn A', 'Litwiniec A', 'Gagat M', 'Drzewucka J', 'Gackowska L', 'Grzanka A']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Karlowicza 24, 85-092 Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Plant Breeding and Acclimatization Institute - National Research Institute Radzikow, Research Division in Bydgoszcz, Department of Genetics and Breeding of Root Crops, Laboratory of Biotechnology, Powstancow Wielkopolskich 10, 85-090 Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Karlowicza 24, 85-092 Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Karlowicza 24, 85-092 Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Sklodowskiej-Curie 9, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Karlowicza 24, 85-092 Bydgoszcz, Poland.

A cohort of 123,322 children born in Denmark between 1964 and 2006 to 68,255 women who had been evaluated for infertility was established. We used a case-cohort design and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer in childhood (0-19 years) and in young adulthood (20-29 years) associated with maternal use of six groups of fertility drugs (clomiphene, gonadotropins [i.e., human menopausal gonadotropins and follicle-stimulating hormone], gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, human chorionic gonadotropins, progesterone and other fertility drugs). We found no statistically significant association between maternal use of fertility drugs and risk for overall cancer in childhood or young adulthood. However, with regard to specific cancers in childhood, our results showed that maternal use of progesterone before childbirth markedly increased the risks of their offspring for acute lymphocytic leukemia (any use: HR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.69-14.54; >/= three cycles of use: HR, 9.96; 95% CI, 2.63-37.77) and for sympathetic nervous system tumors (any use: HR, 5.79; 95% CI, 1.23-27.24; >/= three cycles of use: HR, 8.51; 95% CI, 1.72-42.19).

Chrysin induced apoptosis in leukemia cell lines such as U937, MO7e, THP-1 and HL-60, but there has not yet been data demonstrating the apoptotic effect of chrysin on CLL cells. Therefore, in our investigation we examined the cytotoxicity of chrysin against two leukemia cell lines, MOLT-4 and JVM-13, peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from B-CLL patients and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy individuals in vitro. The effect of chrysin on viability of MOLT-4 and JVM-13 cell lines, B-CLL cells derived from 28 patients and PBMC from 16 healthy subjects was determined by MTT assay. The type of cell death induced by chrysin was verified by Annexin V/7AAD assay and acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining assay. Intracellular localisation and endogenic expression of apoptotic proteins including Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c and caspase-3 were determined by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. Our results demonstrated that exposure of MOLT-4, JVM-13 cell lines and B-CLL cells to the concentration of chrysin of 10muM and higher selectively decreased viability of cells in this cell population, but not in the PBMC derived from healthy subjects; LC50 values of chrysin for B-CLL cells were 51muM for 24 hours and 32muM for 48 hours of incubation, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that chrysin induces the activation of proapoptotic Bax and decreases the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, releases cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and cleavages/activates caspase-3, subsequently leading to the activation of apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Together, these findings suggest that chrysin selectively induces apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from human chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients via mitochondrial pathway in vitro and that it might have a promising role as a potential future antileukemic remedy.","['Zaric, Milan', 'Mitrovic, Marina', 'Nikolic, Ivana', 'Baskic, Dejan', 'Popovic, Suzana', 'Djurdjevic, Predrag', 'Milosavljevic, Zoran', 'Zelen, Ivanka']","['Zaric M', 'Mitrovic M', 'Nikolic I', 'Baskic D', 'Popovic S', 'Djurdjevic P', 'Milosavljevic Z', 'Zelen I']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Svetozara Markovica 69, 34000 Kragujevac, Serbia. zaricmilan@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3CN01F5ZJ5 (chrysin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-62503 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520614666140924123116 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2015;15(2):189-95. doi: 10.2174/1871520614666140924123116.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, SMG1 was suggested as a novel potential tumor suppressor gene, particularly in hypoxic tumors. To investigate the function of SMG1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and found that SMG1 was hypermethylated in the promoter region. SMG1 hypermethylation was found in 66% (33/50) of AML samples compared with none (0/14) of the normal controls. SMG1 mRNA was down-regulated in AML patients with hypermethylation status whereas it was readily expressed in patients without methylation. Moreover, treatment of AML cells with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) inhibited AML cell growth and induced apoptosis by reversing SMG1 methylation status and restoring SMG1 expression. On the other hand, knockdown of SMG1 by RNA interference inhibited apoptosis. We also found that mTOR expression level was negatively correlated to SMG1 expression in AML patients which indicated that SMG1 and mTOR maybe act antagonistically to regulate AML cell growth. In conclusion, our results indicate that SMG1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor with epigenetic regulation in AML.","['Du, Yahui', 'Lu, Fei', 'Li, Peng', 'Ye, Jingjing', 'Ji, Min', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Du Y', 'Lu F', 'Li P', 'Ye J', 'Ji M', 'Ma D', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. fengyinhuijing@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. lufei1985222@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. pengli85@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. jingjing_ye@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. jerrie981@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. daoxinma@sdu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. jichunyan@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (SMG1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms150917065 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms150917065 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2014 Sep 25;15(9):17065-76. doi: 10.3390/ijms150917065.,,,PMC4200422,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells filling the lesion focus are morphologically and immunohistochemically related to blood stem cells. A mechanism of epithelial layer modification under conditions of papillomavirus infection leading to carcinogenesis is proposed. The dynamics of structural changes in the skin is characterized by disturbed interactions between the epithelium and adjacent connective tissue, destruction of the basal membrane, disorders in the cambial keratinocyte differentiation, and absence of the spinous and granular layers. We conclude that detection of blast leukocytes in the human skin lesion can be explained by disorders in the cell-cell interactions in the epithelium-mesenchymal tissue system. High proliferative activity followed by death of cambial keratinocytes, migration of effector antigen-presenting CD68 cells to the adjacent connective tissue are the factors inducing migration of blast leukocytic forms to the focus. Not only keratinocyte restitution capacity, but also epithelium-dependent differentiation of young leukocytes disappeared. Undifferentiated cells are migrated from the blood to the epithelium alteration zone, but not in the reverse direction. The insufficiency or the absence of blood blast cell differentiation of the in the focus of epidermal injury and adjacent tissue triggers carcinogenesis. The authors suggest their model of carcinogenesis. The conclusions offer a new concept of cancer pathogenesis and suggest a new strategy in the search for methods for early diagnosis of carcinogenesis.","['Reva, I V', 'Reva, G V', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Tolmachyov, V E']","['Reva IV', 'Reva GV', 'Yamamoto T', 'Tolmachyov VE']","['School of Biomedicine, Far-Eastern Federal University, Vladivostok, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140926,United States,Bull Exp Biol Med,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,0372557,,IM,"['Aged', 'Alphapapillomavirus/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/*virology']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10517-014-2631-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Exp Biol Med. 2014 Sep;157(5):628-33. doi: 10.1007/s10517-014-2631-9.

IR-induced modulations in multiple biological processes have been proposed to be partly regulated by radiosensitive microRNA (miRNA). In order to gain new insights into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of biological processes after IR, we have investigated changes in mRNA and miRNA expression after high dose IR. RESULTS: IR induced changes in the mRNA and miRNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). When comparing non-irradiated and irradiated samples, we detected a time-dependent increase in differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs, with the highest differences detectable 20 hours after exposure. Gene ontology analysis revealed that very early events (up to 4 hours) after irradiation were specifically associated with p53 signaling and apoptotic pathways, whereas a large number of diverse cellular processes were deregulated after 20 hours. Transcription factor analysis of all up-regulated genes confirmed the importance of p53 in the early post-irradiation phase. When analyzing miRNA expression, we found 177 miRNAs that were significantly regulated in the late post-irradiation phase. Integrating miRNA and target gene expression data, we found a significant negative correlation between miRNA-mRNA and identified hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) as a transcription factor down-regulated in the response to IR. These regulated miRNAs and the HLF target genes were involved in modulating radio-responsive pathways, such as apoptosis, the MAKP signaling pathway, endocytosis, and cytokine-cytokine interactions. CONCLUSION: Using a large dataset of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, we describe the interplay of mRNAs and miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in response to IR at a posttranscriptional level and their involvement in the modulation of radiation-induced biological pathways.","['Beer, Lucian', 'Seemann, Rudolf', 'Ristl, Robin', 'Ellinger, Adolf', 'Kasiri, Mohammad Mahdi', 'Mitterbauer, Andreas', 'Zimmermann, Matthias', 'Gabriel, Christian', 'Gyongyosi, Mariann', 'Klepetko, Walter', 'Mildner, Michael', 'Ankersmit, Hendrik Jan']","['Beer L', 'Seemann R', 'Ristl R', 'Ellinger A', 'Kasiri MM', 'Mitterbauer A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Gabriel C', 'Gyongyosi M', 'Klepetko W', 'Mildner M', 'Ankersmit HJ']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria. michael.mildner@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/blood/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/blood/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-15-814 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-15-814 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2014 Sep 25;15:814. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-814.,,,PMC4182888,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using functional genomic screening, we identify a set of 26 pre-mRNA splicing factors that are required for sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. Loss of spliceosome subunits increases the dissociation rate of cohesin from chromatin and abrogates cohesion after DNA replication, ultimately causing mitotic catastrophe. Depletion of splicing factors causes defective processing of the pre-mRNA encoding sororin, a factor required for the stable association of cohesin with chromatin, and an associated reduction of sororin protein level. Expression of an intronless version of sororin and depletion of the cohesin release protein WAPL suppress the cohesion defect in cells lacking splicing factors. We propose that spliceosome components contribute to sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic chromosome segregation through splicing of sororin pre-mRNA. Our results highlight the loss of cohesion as an early cellular consequence of compromised splicing. This may have clinical implications because SF3B1, a splicing factor that we identify to be essential for cohesion, is recurrently mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Sundaramoorthy, Sriramkumar', 'Vazquez-Novelle, Maria Dolores', 'Lekomtsev, Sergey', 'Howell, Michael', 'Petronczki, Mark']","['Sundaramoorthy S', 'Vazquez-Novelle MD', 'Lekomtsev S', 'Howell M', 'Petronczki M']","['Cell Division and Aneuploidy Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms Hertfordshire, UK.', 'Cell Division and Aneuploidy Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms Hertfordshire, UK.', 'Cell Division and Aneuploidy Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms Hertfordshire, UK.', 'High-throughput Screening Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, London, UK.', 'Cell Division and Aneuploidy Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms Hertfordshire, UK mark.petronczki@cancer.org.uk.']",['eng'],"['Address', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Chromatids/genetics/metabolism', 'Genomics/methods', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors', '*RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', '*Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange']",['NOTNLM'],"['chromosome', 'cohesin', 'cohesion', 'mitosis', 'splicing']",2014/09/27 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['embj.201488244 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201488244 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2014 Nov 18;33(22):2623-42. doi: 10.15252/embj.201488244.

We identified only five reported cases of CLL in pregnancy in the literature. We describe two additional cases, plus three other women with CLL dealing with pregnancy-related decisions. We review the literature and discuss proposals for management and issues that arise in this relatively uncommon occurrence. In contrast to many other haematological malignancies where longer remissions are typically associated with a lower risk of relapse, most patients with CLL who require treatment will ultimately relapse with current therapy.

A multicentric analysis.,491-6,10.1007/s00256-014-2009-0 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: Leukemia is a group of malignant diseases involving peripheral blood and bone marrow. Extramedullary tumor manifestation in leukemia can also occur. They more often involve lymph nodes, skin, and bones. Intramuscular leukemic relapse (ILR) is very unusual. The aim of this analysis was to summarize the reported data regarding clinical signs and radiological features of ILR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for publications related to ILR. After an analysis of all identified articles, 20 publications matched the inclusion criteria. The authors of the 20 publications were contacted and provided imaging of their cases for review. The following were recorded: age, gender, primary diagnosis, clinical signs, pattern, localization and size of the intramuscular leukemic relapse. Images of 16 patients were provided [8 computer tomographic (CT) images and 15 magnetic resonance images, MRI]. Furthermore, one patient with ILR was identified in our institutional database. Therefore, images of 17 patients were available for further analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 32 cases with ILR were included in the analysis. In most cases acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed. Most ILRs were localized in the extremities (44 %) and in the extraocular muscles (44 %). Clinically, ILR manifested as local pain, swelling and muscle weakness. Radiologically, ILR presented most frequently with diffuse muscle infiltration. On postcontrast CT/MRI, most lesions demonstrated homogeneous enhancement. ILRs were hypo-/isointense on T1w and hyperintense on T2w images. CONCLUSION: ILR manifests commonly as focal pain, swelling and muscle weakness. ILR predominantly involved the extraocular musculature and the extremities. Radiologically, diffuse muscle infiltration was the most common imaging finding.","['Surov, Alexey', 'Kiratli, Hayyam', 'Im, Soo Ah', 'Manabe, Yasuhiro', ""O'Neill, Alibhe"", 'Shinagare, Atul B', 'Spielmann, Rolf Peter']","['Surov A', 'Kiratli H', 'Im SA', 'Manabe Y', ""O'Neill A"", 'Shinagare AB', 'Spielmann RP']","['Department of Radiology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany, alex.surow@medizin.uni-halle.de', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. hayyamkiratli@gmail.com', ""Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. saim@catholic.ac.kr"", 'Department of Neurology, National Hospital Organization Okayama Medical Center, Okayama, Japan. ymanabe@okayama3.hosp.go.jp', ""Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. ailbheconeill@yahoo.co.uk"", 'ASHINAGARE@PARTNERS.ORG', 'Department of Diagnostic and Inverventional Radiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140926,Germany,Skeletal Radiol,Skeletal radiology,7701953,['0 (Contrast Media)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contrast Media', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology/therapy', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology/therapy', 'Radiographic Image Enhancement', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00256-014-2009-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Skeletal Radiol. 2015 Apr;44(4):491-6. doi: 10.1007/s00256-014-2009-0.

However, there is no consensus on whether EMR failure at 3 months requires a change in therapy, and the value of the 6-month time point remains under debate. Some patients who do not achieve EMR at 3 months achieve significant decreases in BCR-ABL levels by 6 months, whereas others have progressive disease. For patients who do not achieve EMR at either time point, the risk of disease progression is higher both between 3 and 6 months and over the longer term, underlining the therapeutic relevance of the 3- to 6-month time period. For patients with EMR failure at 3 months, although there is currently no consensus on whether to switch therapy or wait until the 6-month assessment, some patients may benefit from an early change in treatment. This review synthesizes key clinical data demonstrating improved outcomes associated with the achievement of EMR and discusses the relevance of the 3- and 6-month time points on survival and the risk of disease progression.

Most mutations generate a cysteine at the transmembrane domain leading to receptor homodimerization through disulfide bond formation and ligand-independent activation of STAT5. We hypothesized that the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-tolerated drug used widely in clinical practice to treat acetaminophen overdose, would reduce disulfide bond formation, and inhibit mutant IL7R-mediated oncogenic signalling. We found that treatment with NAC disrupted IL7R homodimerization in IL7R-mutant DND-41 cells as assessed by non-reducing Western blot, as well as in a luciferase complementation assay. NAC led to STAT5 dephosphorylation and cell apoptosis at clinically achievable concentrations in DND-41 cells, and Ba/F3 cells transformed by an IL7R-mutant construct containing a cysteine insertion. The apoptotic effects of NAC could be rescued in part by a constitutively active allele of STAT5. Despite using doses lower than those tolerated in humans, NAC treatment significantly inhibited the progression of human DND-41 cells engrafted in immunodeficient mice. Thus, targeting leukaemogenic IL7R homodimerization with NAC offers a potentially effective and feasible therapeutic strategy that warrants testing in patients with T-ALL.","['Mansour, Marc R', 'Reed, Casie', 'Eisenberg, Amy R', 'Tseng, Jen-Chieh', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Daakour, Sarah', 'Yoda, Akinori', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Tal, Noa', 'Shochat, Chen', 'Berezovskaya, Alla', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Kentsis, Alex', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Mansour MR', 'Reed C', 'Eisenberg AR', 'Tseng JC', 'Twizere JC', 'Daakour S', 'Yoda A', 'Rodig SJ', 'Tal N', 'Shochat C', 'Berezovskaya A', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Weinstock DM', 'Izraeli S', 'Kung AL', 'Kentsis A', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140926,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RPSA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Laminin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell lymphoma', 'acute leukaemia', 'therapy']",2014/09/27 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13115 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jan;168(2):230-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13115.

The nucleotide-induced oligomeric regulation of hRNR subunit alpha is increasingly being recognized as an innate and drug-relevant mechanism for enzyme activity modulation. In the presence of negative feedback inhibitor dATP and leukemia drug clofarabine nucleotides, hRNR-alpha assembles into catalytically inert hexameric complexes, whereas nucleotide effectors that govern substrate specificity typically trigger alpha-dimerization. Currently, both knowledge of and tools to interrogate the oligomeric assembly pathway of RNR in any species in real time are lacking. We therefore developed a fluorimetric assay that reliably reports on oligomeric state changes of alpha with high sensitivity.

METHODS: Samples were obtained from donors without joint pathology (n = 39), with focal defects (n = 65) and osteoarthritis (n = 61). A multiplex bead assay (Luminex) was performed measuring up to 21 cytokines: Interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-6, IL-6Ralpha, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, Interferon (IFN)gamma, oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), adiponectin, leptin, monocyte chemotactic factor (MCP)1, RANTES, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular growth factor (VEGF). RESULTS: In synovial fluid of patients with cartilage pathology, IL-6, IL-13, IFNgamma and OSM levels were higher than in donors without joint pathology (P </= 0.001). IL-13, IFNgamma and OSM were also different between donors with cartilage defects and OA (P < 0.05). In cartilage tissue from debrided defects, VEGF was higher than in non-pathological or osteoarthritic joints (P </= 0.001). IL-1alpha, IL-6, TNFalpha and OSM concentrations (in ng/ml) were markedly higher in cartilage tissue than in synovial fluid (P <0.01). Culture of chondrocytes generally led to a massive induction of most cytokines (P < 0.001). Although the release of inflammatory cytokines was also here dependent on the pathological condition (P < 0.001) the actual profiles were different from tissue or synovial fluid and between non-expanded and expanded chondrocytes. Cartilage formation was lower by healthy unexpanded chondrocytes than by osteoarthritic or defect chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Several pro-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic and pro-repair cytokines were elevated in joints with symptomatic cartilage defects and/or osteoarthritis, although different cytokines were elevated in synovial fluid compared to tissue or cells. Hence a clear molecular profile was evident dependent on disease status of the joint, which however changed in composition depending on the biological sample analysed. These alterations did not affect in vitro tissue formation with these chondrocytes, as this was at least as effective or even better compared to healthy chondrocytes.","['Tsuchida, Anika I', 'Beekhuizen, Michiel', ""'t Hart, Marieke C"", 'Radstake, Timothy R D J', 'Dhert, Wouter J A', 'Saris, Daniel B F', 'van Osch, Gerjo J V M', 'Creemers, Laura B']","['Tsuchida AI', 'Beekhuizen M', ""'t Hart MC"", 'Radstake TR', 'Dhert WJ', 'Saris DB', 'van Osch GJ', 'Creemers LB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140926,England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-1alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cartilage/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/*metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytokines/classification/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-13/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1alpha/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Joints/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncostatin M/metabolism', 'Osteoarthritis/*metabolism', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Synovial Fluid/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['s13075-014-0441-0 [pii]', '10.1186/s13075-014-0441-0 [doi]']",epublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2014 Sep 26;16(5):441. doi: 10.1186/s13075-014-0441-0.,,,PMC4201683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However such analysis is necessary in order to accurately delineate how genetic information is transcribed, expressed, and regulated to give rise to an enormously diverse range of cell phenotypes. Here we report on a microfluidics-facilitated approach that allows for controlled separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear contents of a single cell followed by on-chip amplification of genomic DNA and cytoplasmic mRNA. When coupled with off-chip polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing, a panel of genes and transcripts from the same single cell can be co-detected and sequenced. This platform is potentially an enabling tool to permit multiple genomic measurements performed on the same single cells and opens new opportunities to tackle a range of fundamental biology questions including non-genetic cell-to-cell variability, epigenetic regulation, and stem cell fate control. It also helps address clinical challenges such as diagnosing intra-tumor heterogeneity and dissecting complex cellular immune responses.","['Han, Lin', 'Zi, Xiaoyuan', 'Garmire, Lana X', 'Wu, Yu', 'Weissman, Sherman M', 'Pan, Xinghua', 'Fan, Rong']","['Han L', 'Zi X', 'Garmire LX', 'Wu Y', 'Weissman SM', 'Pan X', 'Fan R']","['1] Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA [2].', '1] Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA [2] Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA [3] Department of Cell Biology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China [4].', 'Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', '1] Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA [2] Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', '1] Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA [2] Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140926,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', '*Microfluidics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Single-Cell Analysis']",,,2014/09/27 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['srep06485 [pii]', '10.1038/srep06485 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Sep 26;4:6485. doi: 10.1038/srep06485.,,"['P01 GM099130/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P01GM099130-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4175731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classical (or canonical) pathway typically leads to the induction of RelA or c-Rel containing complexes, and involves the degradation of IkappaBalpha in a manner dependent on IkappaB kinase (IKK) beta and the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO. The alternative (or non-canonical) pathway, involves the inducible processing of p100 to p52, leading to the induction of NF-kappaB2(p52)/RelB containing complexes, and is dependent on IKKalpha and NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK). Here we demonstrate that in primary human fibroblasts, the alternative NF-kappaB pathway subunits NF-kappaB2 and RelB have multiple, but distinct, effects on the expression of key regulators of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and protein stability. Specifically, following siRNA knockdown, quantitative PCR, western blot analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show that NF-kappaB2 regulates the expression of CDK4 and CDK6, while RelB, through the regulation of genes such as PSMA5 and ANAPC1, regulates the stability of p21WAF1 and the tumour suppressor p53. These combine to regulate the activity of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, leading to induction of polycomb protein EZH2 expression. Moreover, our ChIP analysis demonstrates that EZH2 is also a direct NF-kappaB target gene. Microarray analysis revealed that in fibroblasts, EZH2 antagonizes a subset of p53 target genes previously associated with the senescent cell phenotype, including DEK and RacGAP1. We show that this pathway provides the major route of crosstalk between the alternative NF-kappaB pathway and p53, a consequence of which is to suppress cell senescence. Importantly, we find that activation of NF-kappaB also induces EZH2 expression in CD40L stimulated cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients. We therefore propose that this pathway provides a mechanism through which microenvironment induced NF-kappaB can inhibit tumor suppressor function and promote tumorigenesis.","['Iannetti, Alessio', 'Ledoux, Adeline C', 'Tudhope, Susan J', 'Sellier, Helene', 'Zhao, Bo', 'Mowla, Sophia', 'Moore, Adam', 'Hummerich, Holger', 'Gewurz, Benjamin E', 'Cockell, Simon J', 'Jat, Parmjit S', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Perkins, Neil D']","['Iannetti A', 'Ledoux AC', 'Tudhope SJ', 'Sellier H', 'Zhao B', 'Mowla S', 'Moore A', 'Hummerich H', 'Gewurz BE', 'Cockell SJ', 'Jat PS', 'Willmore E', 'Perkins ND']","['Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Infectious Disease, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", 'Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Infectious Disease, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", 'Bioinformatics Support Unit, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['CD40 Ligand/agonists/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'RNA Interference', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelB/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,,2014/09/26 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1004642 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-14-00912 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2014 Sep 25;10(9):e1004642. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004642. eCollection 2014 Sep.,,"['R01 CA12850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '094409/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'K08 CA140780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '13-1150/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'C1443/A9215/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C1443/A12750/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",PMC4177746,,,['GEO/GSE55105'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Busulfan and cyclophosphamide have been used as an alternative to TBI. Etoposide also has been widely used to enhance antileukemic effect. However, toxicities have been reported in some studies using busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide regimen. A reduced toxicity myeloablative regimen using busulfan and fludarabine showed promising results. Also, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and administration of targeted doses of busulfan have been recommended to improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this study, we evaluated the outcome of HSCT using a targeted once-daily i.v. busulfan-fludarabine-etoposide (BuFluVP) regimen in pediatric and infant ALL. Busulfan (age >/= 1 year, 120 mg/m(2); age < 1 year, 80 mg/m(2)) was administered once daily as the first dose on day -8, and a targeted dose of busulfan was used according to the TDM results on days -7 to -5. Forty-four patients were evaluated. Donor-type neutrophil engraftment was achieved in all patients. Veno-occlusive disease occurred in 7 patients (15.9%), but all patients were successfully treated. Cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality and relapse were 9.1% and 9.9%, respectively. One-year overall survival and event-free survival rates of all patients were 86.2% and 83.8%, respectively. Twelve patients (27.3%) were infants at diagnosis, and their 1-year overall survival rate was 83.3%. Our study demonstrated that HSCT using a targeted once-daily i.v.

Only a few molecular targets of the IgE response in S. mansoni infection have been characterised. A better insight into the basic mechanisms of anti-parasite immunity could be gained from a genome-wide characterisation of such S. mansoni allergens. This would have repercussions on our understanding of allergy and the development of safe and efficacious vaccinations against helminthic parasites. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A complete medium- to high-throughput amenable workflow, including important quality controls, is described, which enables the rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins using wheat germ lysate and subsequent assessment of potential allergenicity with a humanised Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) reporter cell line. Cell-free translation is completed within 90 minutes, generating sufficient amounts of parasitic protein for rapid screening of allergenicity without any need for purification. Antigenic integrity is demonstrated using Western Blotting. After overnight incubation with infected individuals' serum, the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line is challenged with the complete wheat germ translation mixture and Luciferase activity measured, reporting cellular activation by the suspected allergen. The suitability of this system for characterization of novel S. mansoni allergens is demonstrated using well characterised plant and parasitic allergens such as Par j 2, SmTAL-1 and the IgE binding factor IPSE/alpha-1, expressed in wheat germ lysates and/or E. coli. SmTAL-1, but not SmTAL2 (used as a negative control), was able to activate the basophil reporter cell line. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This method offers an accessible way for assessment of potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates and is suitable for medium- to high-throughput studies using infected individual sera. It is also suitable for the study of the basis of allergenicity of helminthic proteins.","['Wan, Daniel', 'Ludolf, Fernanda', 'Alanine, Daniel G W', 'Stretton, Owen', 'Ali Ali, Eman', 'Al-Barwary, Nafal', 'Wang, Xiaowei', 'Doenhoff, Michael J', 'Mari, Adriano', 'Fitzsimmons, Colin M', 'Dunne, David W', 'Nakamura, Ryosuke', 'Oliveira, Guilherme C', 'Alcocer, Marcos J C', 'Falcone, Franco H']","['Wan D', 'Ludolf F', 'Alanine DG', 'Stretton O', 'Ali Ali E', 'Al-Barwary N', 'Wang X', 'Doenhoff MJ', 'Mari A', 'Fitzsimmons CM', 'Dunne DW', 'Nakamura R', 'Oliveira GC', 'Alcocer MJ', 'Falcone FH']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom; School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'Genomics and Computational Biology Group, Centro de Pesquisas Rene Rachou, National Institute of Science and Technology in Tropical Diseases, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz - FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom; School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Center for Molecular Allergology, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy; Associated Centres for Molecular Allergology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Medicinal Safety Science, National Institute of Health Sciences, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genomics and Computational Biology Group, Centro de Pesquisas Rene Rachou, National Institute of Science and Technology in Tropical Diseases, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz - FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Helminth)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Protozoan Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Helminth/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Helminth Proteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Protozoan Vaccines/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/26 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0003124 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-14-00771 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2014 Sep 25;8(9):e3124. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003124. eCollection 2014 Sep.,,,PMC4177753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the cure rate of ALL has improved over the past decades, the most important reason for ALL treatment failure is multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon. The current study aims to explain the mechanisms involved in multidrug resistance of childhood ALL, and introduces ATP-binding cassette transporterA2 (ABCA2) as an ABC transporter gene which may have a high impact on MDR. Benefiting from articles published inreputable journals from1994 to date and experiments newly performed by our group, a comprehensive review is written about ABCA2 and its role in MDR regarding childhood ALL. ABCA2 transports drugs from the cytoplasm into the lysosomal compartment, where they may become degraded and exported from the cell. The aforementioned mechanism may contribute to MDR. It has been reported that ABCA2 may induce resistance to mitoxantrone, estrogen derivatives and estramustine. It is resistant to the aforementioned compounds. Furthermore, the overexpression ofABCA2 in methotrexate, vinblastine and/or doxorubicin treated Jurkat cells are observed in several publications. The recent study of our group showsthatthe overexpression ofABCA2 gene in children with ALL increases the risk of MDR by 15 times. ABCA2 is the second identified member of the ABCA; ABC transporters' subfamily. ABCA2 gene expression profile is suggested to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in ALL treatment. Better understanding of the MDR mechanisms and the factors involved may improve the therapeutic outcome of ALL by modifying the treatment protocols.","['Aberuyi, N', 'Rahgozar, S', 'Moafi, A']","['Aberuyi N', 'Rahgozar S', 'Moafi A']","['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Iran.', 'Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Paediatric-Oncology, SayedolShohada Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140720,Iran,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol,Iranian journal of pediatric hematology and oncology,101571320,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP-binding cassette transporter', 'Leukemia', 'drug resistance']",2014/09/26 06:00,2014/09/26 06:01,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol. 2014;4(3):118-26.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single centred, cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers of children with leukemia at the Hematology and Oncology research center, Baghaie-Pour clinic in Yazd City during February through December, 2013. The study sample included 58 mothers with 1-12 year old children with the diagnosis or treated at the Shahid Sadoughi hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics were gathered using a socio-demographic form and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was applied to all mothers to assess symptoms of depression. All variables that could potentially impact dependent outcome measures of the BDI were analyzed. These factors were mothers' age, mothers' education, and socioeconomic status of the family, gender of child. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that mothers of children leukemia had a severe level of depression (p=0.01). 41 participants (70.6%) indicated their current depressive symptoms as being in the severe range, 12 participants (20.6%) in the moderate range, and 5 participants (8.6%) in the mild range or no depression. There was an inverse correlation between the educational level of the mothers and the heads of household, their occupational status, their marital status, their socio-economic condition and depression (p</=0.05). The depression scores of the mothers of patients were higher than those of the controls. CONCLUSION: Depression ideation is common among mothers of children with leukemia.

Eltrombopag binds to another region of the thrombopoietin receptor compared to endogenous thrombopoietin and stimulates the proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes and the platelet production in a dose-dependent manner. Eltrombopag has proven its effectiveness for the treatment of patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia. Its indication for other hemopathies or situations (like thrombocytopenia secondary to chemo- or radiotherapy, acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndroms, acquired and hereditary bone marrow failure, and platelet donors) is under study. Eltrombopag may be particularly useful in patients with advanced chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis who require antiviral treatment. We present a minireview on the results of treatment with eltrombopag in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus, highlighting the benefits and mentioning possible adverse effects. In some studies eltrombopag increased the number of virological responses after clasical antiviral treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C and reduced the transfusional requirements of those who had to be subjected to invasive surgery. Eltrombopag is a solution for many of these patients, which allows them receiving antiviral therapy and sometimes getting a sustained virological response, but they must be well monitored to prevent possible thromboembolic or bone marrow complications or liver failure occurrence.","['Mihaila, Romeo-Gabriel', 'Cipaian, Remus-Calin']","['Mihaila RG', 'Cipaian RC']","['Romeo-Gabriel Mihaila, Remus-Calin Cipaian, Faculty of Medicine, ""Lucian Blaga"" University of Sibiu, Sibiu, Cod 550169, Romania.', 'Romeo-Gabriel Mihaila, Remus-Calin Cipaian, Faculty of Medicine, ""Lucian Blaga"" University of Sibiu, Sibiu, Cod 550169, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hematologic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzoates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematologic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/blood/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*agonists/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/chemically induced/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Thrombopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic hepatitis C', 'Eltrombopag', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Platelets', 'Thrombocytopenia']",2014/09/26 06:00,2015/05/28 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v20.i35.12517 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2014 Sep 21;20(35):12517-21. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v20.i35.12517.,,,PMC4168085,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deleterious consequences are cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV accounts the most frequent cause for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver transplantation (LT) in the western world. The underlying molecular mechanisms how HCV promotes tumor development are largely unknown. There is some in vitro and in vivo evidence that HCV interferes with the tumor suppressor PML and may thereby importantly contribute to the HCV-associated pathogenesis with respect to the development of HCC. The tumor suppressor protein ""promyelocytic leukemia"" (PML) has been implicated in the regulation of important cellular processes like differentiation and apoptosis. In cancer biology, PML and its associated nuclear bodies (NBs) have initially attracted intense interest due to its role in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). More recently, loss of PML has been implicated in human cancers of various histologic origins. Moreover, number and intensity of PML-NBs increase in response to interferons (IFNs) and there is evidence that PML-NBs may represent preferential targets in viral infections. Thus, PML could not only play a role in the mechanisms of the antiviral action of IFNs but may also be involved in a direct oncogenic effect of the HCV on hepatocytes. This review aims to summarise current knowledge about HCV-related liver carcinogenesis and to discuss a potential role of the nuclear body protein PML for this this hard-to-treat cancer.","['Herzer, Kerstin', 'Gerken, Guido', 'Hofmann, Thomas G']","['Herzer K', 'Gerken G', 'Hofmann TG']","['Kerstin Herzer, Guido Gerken, Department for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany.', 'Kerstin Herzer, Guido Gerken, Department for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany.', 'Kerstin Herzer, Guido Gerken, Department for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/virology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Hepacivirus/immunology/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Nuclear bodies', 'Promyelocytic leukemia']",2014/09/26 06:00,2015/05/28 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v20.i35.12367 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2014 Sep 21;20(35):12367-71. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v20.i35.12367.,,,PMC4168070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dual inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Janus kinase (JAK) represents such a strategy and may elicit several benefits relative to selective kinase inhibition, such as gaining control over a broader array of disease etiologies, reducing probability of selection for bypass disease mechanisms, and the potential that an overall lower level suppression of individual targets may be sufficient to modulate disease activity. To this end, we provide data on the discovery and preclinical development of PRT062070 [4-(cyclopropylamino)-2-({4-[4-(ethylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}amino)pyrimid ine-5-carboxamide hydrochloride], an orally active kinase inhibitor that demonstrates activity against SYK and JAK. Cellular assays demonstrated specific inhibitory activity against signaling pathways that use SYK and JAK1/3. Limited inhibition of JAK2 was observed, and PRT062070 did not inhibit phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated signaling or activation in B and T cells nor T-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling in T cells, providing evidence for selectivity of action. Potent antitumor activity was observed in a subset of B-cell lymphoma cell lines. After oral dosing, PRT062070 suppressed inflammation and autoantibody generation in a rat collagen-induced arthritis model and blocked B-cell activation and splenomegaly in a mouse model of chronic B-cell antigen receptor stimulation. PRT062070 is currently under evaluation in a phase I dose escalation study in patients with B-cell leukemia and lymphoma (NCT01994382), with proof-of-concept studies in humans planned to assess therapeutic potential in autoimmune and malignant diseases.","['Coffey, Greg', 'Betz, Andreas', 'DeGuzman, Francis', 'Pak, Yvonne', 'Inagaki, Mayuko', 'Baker, Dale C', 'Hollenbach, Stanley J', 'Pandey, Anjali', 'Sinha, Uma']","['Coffey G', 'Betz A', 'DeGuzman F', 'Pak Y', 'Inagaki M', 'Baker DC', 'Hollenbach SJ', 'Pandey A', 'Sinha U']","['Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California gcoffey@portola.com.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140924,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0', '(4-(cyclopropylamino)-2-((4-(4-(ethylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)amino)pyrimid', 'ine-5-carboxamide)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Autoimmunity/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cattle', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Sulfones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/26 06:00,2015/02/18 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.114.218164 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.114.218164 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2014 Dec;351(3):538-48. doi: 10.1124/jpet.114.218164.

Recently, EZH2 mutations have been reported at Y641, A677, and A687 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although the Y641F/N/S/H/C and A677G mutations exhibit clearly increased activity with substrates dimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me2), the A687V mutant has been shown to prefer a monomethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me1) with little gain of activity toward H3K27me2. Herein, we demonstrate that despite this unique substrate preference, A687V EZH2 still drives increased H3K27me3 when transiently expressed in cells. However, unlike the previously described mutants that dramatically deplete global H3K27me2 levels, A687V EZH2 retains normal levels of H3K27me2. Sequencing of B-cell-derived cancer cell lines identified an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line harboring this mutation. Similar to exogenous expression of A687V EZH2, this cell line exhibited elevated H3K27me3 while possessing H3K27me2 levels higher than Y641- or A677-mutant lines. Treatment of A687V EZH2-mutant cells with GSK126, a selective EZH2 inhibitor, was associated with a global decrease in H3K27me3, robust gene activation, caspase activation, and decreased proliferation. Structural modeling of the A687V EZH2 active site suggests that the increased catalytic activity with H3K27me1 may be due to a weakened interaction with an active site water molecule that must be displaced for dimethylation to occur. These findings suggest that A687V EZH2 likely increases global H3K27me3 indirectly through increased catalytic activity with H3K27me1 and cells harboring this mutation are highly dependent on EZH2 activity for their survival.","['Ott, Heidi M', 'Graves, Alan P', 'Pappalardi, Melissa B', 'Huddleston, Michael', 'Halsey, Wendy S', 'Hughes, Ashley M', 'Groy, Arthur', 'Dul, Edward', 'Jiang, Yong', 'Bai, Yuchen', 'Annan, Roland', 'Verma, Sharad K', 'Knight, Steven D', 'Kruger, Ryan G', 'Dhanak, Dashyant', 'Schwartz, Benjamin', 'Tummino, Peter J', 'Creasy, Caretha L', 'McCabe, Michael T']","['Ott HM', 'Graves AP', 'Pappalardi MB', 'Huddleston M', 'Halsey WS', 'Hughes AM', 'Groy A', 'Dul E', 'Jiang Y', 'Bai Y', 'Annan R', 'Verma SK', 'Knight SD', 'Kruger RG', 'Dhanak D', 'Schwartz B', 'Tummino PJ', 'Creasy CL', 'McCabe MT']","['Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Molecular Medicine Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Platform Technology and Science, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Cancer Research, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.

KRAS mutations were associated with a reduced overall survival. Mutation screening of the matched diagnostic samples found many to be wild type (WT); however, by using more sensitive allelic-specific assays, low-level mutated subpopulations were found in many cases, suggesting that they survived up-front therapy and subsequently emerged at relapse.

They include influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1), and Nipah virus. It is also suggested that the interaction between viruses and galectins influences viral attachment to their susceptible cells, affecting the viral infectivity. Our work suggests that galectin-1 increases the infectivity of HIV-1 and HTVL-1. Indeed, galectin-1 promotes the initial adsorption of HIV-1 to CD4(+) cells through its binding to viral envelope gp120 and facilitates HIV-1 infection in a manner that is dependent on its recognition of beta-galactoside residues. Thus, as galectin-1 can be considered as a pattern recognition receptor, HIV-1 exploits this host factor to promote its transmission or replication. In this chapter, we describe methods used to investigate this potential role of galectins in HIV-1 infection as a case in point for future studies on galectin-virus interactions.","['Ouellet, Michel', 'St-Pierre, Christian', 'Tremblay, Michel J', 'Sato, Sachiko']","['Ouellet M', 'St-Pierre C', 'Tremblay MJ', 'Sato S']","['Laboratory of Human Immuno-Retrovirology, Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Galectins)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Galectins/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Core Protein p24/metabolism', 'HIV-1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/virology', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Ultracentrifugation', 'Virus Attachment']",,,2014/09/26 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-1396-1_26 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2015;1207:397-420. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-1396-1_26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 137 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; mean current age = 14.3 years, SD = 4.8; time since diagnosis = 7.6 years, SD = 1.6) completed the N-back task and comprehensive neurocognitive testing, including standardized measures of attention, processing speed, and working memory. Results indicated that females demonstrated significantly slower reaction times (0-back p = .02; 1-back p = .03) than males. Survivors <15 years old at the time of testing demonstrated a significant decrease in accuracy as working memory load increased compared to survivors >/=15 years old (p < .001). Performance on the N-back task was associated with nonverbal working memory (rs = .56, p < .001) in survivors >/=15 years of age. For younger survivors, N-back performance was more strongly associated with attention skills. Results suggest the N-back assesses different cognitive constructs at younger compared to older childhood ages. These age differences should be considered in interpreting functional brain imaging results.","['Luxton, Joshua', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Kimberg, Cara', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Luxton J', 'Brinkman TM', 'Kimberg C', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR']","[""a Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control , St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , TN , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,England,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,8502170,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Developmental Disabilities/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*diagnosis/*etiology', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*mortality', 'ROC Curve', 'Reaction Time/physiology', 'Serial Learning', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'N-back', 'Working memory']",2014/09/26 06:00,2015/07/07 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13803395.2014.957168 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol. 2014;36(9):944-55. doi: 10.1080/13803395.2014.957168.

Here we demonstrate that HOXA1, HOXA6 and predominantly HOXA9 are able to induce the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1). In chromatin immunoprecipitations, HOXA9 bound directly to the putative promoter and a DNase-hypersensitive region in the first intron of the Igf1 gene. Transcription rates of the Igf1 gene paralleled HOXA9 activity. Primary cells transformed by HOXA9 expressed functional Igf1 receptors and activated the protein kinase Akt in response to Igf1 stimulation, suggesting the existence of an autocrine signaling loop. Genomic deletion of the Igf1 gene by Cre-mediated recombination increased sensitivity toward apoptosis after serum starvation. In addition, the leukemogenic potential of Igf1-negative, HOXA9-transformed cells was impaired, leading to a significant delay in disease development on transplantation into recipient animals.","['Steger, J', 'Fuller, E', 'Garcia-Cuellar, M-P', 'Hetzner, K', 'Slany, R K']","['Steger J', 'Fuller E', 'Garcia-Cuellar MP', 'Hetzner K', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140925,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Feedback, Physiological', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/09/26 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014287 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.287 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):901-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.287.

Deep sequencing validation was performed on the WGS samples and an additional sample obtained during sAML remission/relapsed PMF. Clustering analysis of 649 validated somatic single-nucleotide variants revealed four distinct clonal groups, each including putative driver mutations. The first group (including JAK2 and U2AF1), representing the founding clone, included mutations with high frequency at all three disease stages. The second clonal group (including MYB) was present only in PMF, suggesting the presence of a clone that was dispensable for transformation. The third group (including ASXL1) contained mutations with low frequency in PMF and high frequency in subsequent samples, indicating evolution of the dominant clone with disease progression. The fourth clonal group (including IDH1 and RUNX1) was acquired at sAML transformation and was predominantly absent at sAML remission/relapsed PMF.

Using the murine Emu-Tcl1 CLL model, we demonstrate that CXCR5-controlled access to follicular dendritic cells confers proliferative stimuli to leukemia B cells. Intravital imaging revealed a marginal zone B cell-like leukemia cell trafficking route. Murine and human CLL cells reciprocally stimulated resident mesenchymal stromal cells through lymphotoxin-beta-receptor activation, resulting in CXCL13 secretion and stromal compartment remodeling. Inhibition of lymphotoxin/lymphotoxin-beta-receptor signaling or of CXCR5 signaling retards leukemia progression. Thus, CXCR5 activity links tumor cell homing, shaping a survival niche, and access to localized proliferation stimuli. SIGNIFICANCE: CLL and other indolent lymphoma are not curable and usually relapse after treatment, a process in which the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role.

Previously, we have demonstrated that ts1 infection caused two separate events of ROS upregulation. The first upregulation occurs during early viral establishment in host cells and the second during the virus-mediated apoptotic process. In this study, we show that virus-mediated ROS upregulation activates the protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia mutated, which in turn phosphorylates serine 15 on p53. This activation of p53 however, is unlikely associated with ts1-induced cell death. Rather p53 appears to be involved in suppressing intracellular ROS levels in astrocytes under oxidative stress. The activated p53 appears to delay retroviral gene expression by suppressing NADPH oxidase, a superoxide-producing enzyme. These results suggest that p53 plays a role as a retrovirus-mediated oxidative stress modulator.","['Kim, Soo Jin', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Kim SJ', 'Wong PKY']","['Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140924,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Astrocytes/virology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics/virology', 'Brain/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,2014/09/26 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/09/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.070391-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2015 Jan;96(Pt 1):144-149. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.070391-0.

With the neurovirulent murine leukemia virus (MLV) FrCasE, Env protein expression within glia leads to postsynaptic vacuolation, cellular effacement, and neuronal loss in the absence of neuroinflammation. To understand the physiological changes associated with MLV-induced spongiosis, and its neuronal specificity, we employed patch-clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging in brain slices of the mouse inferior colliculus (IC), a midbrain nucleus that undergoes extensive spongiosis. IC neurons characterized by postinhibitory rebound firing (PIR) were selectively affected in FrCasE-infected mice. Coincident with Env expression in microglia and in glia characterized by NG2 proteoglycan expression (NG2 cells), rebound neurons (RNs) lost PIR, became hyperexcitable, and were reduced in number. PIR loss and hyperexcitability were reversed by raising internal calcium buffer concentrations in RNs. PIR-initiated rhythmic circuits were disrupted, and spontaneous synchronized bursting and prolonged depolarizations were widespread. Other IC neuron cell types and circuits within the same degenerative environment were unaffected. Antagonists of NMDA and/or AMPA receptors reduced burst firing in the IC but did not affect prolonged depolarizations. Antagonists of L-type calcium channels abolished both bursts and slow depolarizations. IC infection by the nonneurovirulent isogenic virus Friend 57E (Fr57E), whose Env protein is structurally similar to FrCasE, showed no RN hyperactivity or cell loss; however, PIR latency increased. These findings suggest that spongiform neurodegeneration arises from the unique excitability of RNs, their local regulation by glia, and the disruption of this relationship by glial expression of abnormal protein.","['Li, Ying', 'Davey, Robert A', 'Sivaramakrishnan, Shobhana', 'Lynch, William P']","['Li Y', 'Davey RA', 'Sivaramakrishnan S', 'Lynch WP']","['Department of Integrated Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio;', 'Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas; and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.', 'Department of Integrated Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140514,United States,J Neurophysiol,Journal of neurophysiology,0375404,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Hearing Loss/physiopathology', 'Inferior Colliculi/physiopathology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Microglia/physiology/virology', 'Neural Pathways/physiopathology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Neuroglia/physiology/virology', 'Neurons/*physiology/virology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*physiopathology/virology', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*physiopathology/virology', 'Voltage-Sensitive Dye Imaging']",['NOTNLM'],"['auditory midbrain', 'inferior colliculus', 'postinhibitory rebound neurons', 'retrovirus', 'voltage-sensitive dyes']",2014/09/25 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jn.00227.2014 [pii]', '10.1152/jn.00227.2014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurophysiol. 2014 Aug 1;112(3):683-704. doi: 10.1152/jn.00227.2014.

However, the scenario in which this event might occur remains unknown. In order to gain insight into this scenario we investigated the molecular, cytogenetic and haematological features of 223 CLL-like (n = 84) and CLL (n = 139) clones with stereotyped (n = 32) versus non-stereotyped (n = 191) immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) amino acid sequences. Overall, stereotyped CLL-like MBL and CLL clones showed a unique IGHV profile, associated with higher IGHV1 and lower IGHV3 gene family usage (P = 0.03), longer IGHV complementary determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences (P = 0.007) and unmutated IGHV (P < 0.001) versus non-stereotyped clones. Whilst the overall size of the stereotyped B-cell clones in peripheral blood did not appear to be associated with the CLL-related cytogenetic profile of B-cells (P > 0.05), it did show a significant association with the presence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-associated immunophenotypes on peripheral blood neutrophils and/or monocytes (P = 0.01). Altogether our results point to the potential involvement of different selection forces in the expansion of stereotyped vs. non-stereotyped CLL and CLL-like MBL clones, the former being potentially favoured by an underlying altered haematopoiesis.","['Rodriguez-Caballero, Arancha', 'Henriques, Ana', 'Criado, Ignacio', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Matarraz, Sergio', 'Lopez, Antonio', 'Balanzategui, Ana', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Nieto, Wendy G', 'Cortesao, Emilia', 'Paiva, Artur', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Rodriguez-Caballero A', 'Henriques A', 'Criado I', 'Langerak AW', 'Matarraz S', 'Lopez A', 'Balanzategui A', 'Gonzalez M', 'Nieto WG', 'Cortesao E', 'Paiva A', 'Almeida J', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Medicine and Cytometry Service, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC, USAL-CSIC), Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), University of Salamanca (USAL), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140924,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'cytogenetic profile', 'monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis', 'myelodysplastic syndrome immunophenotype', 'stereotyped IGHV amino acid sequences']",2014/09/25 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13127 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jan;168(2):258-67. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13127.

Substantial attention has been given to the possible health risks associated with human exposure to radiation from damaged reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. Cumulative doses were estimated and applied for each post-accident year of life, based on a reference level of exposure during the first year after the earthquake. A lifetime cumulative dose of twice the first year dose was estimated for the primary radionuclide contaminants ((134)Cs and (137)Cs) and are based on Chernobyl data, relative abundances of cesium isotopes, and cleanup efforts. Risks for particularly radiosensitive cancer sites (leukemia, thyroid and breast cancer), as well as the combined risk for all solid cancers were considered. The male and female cumulative risks of cancer incidence attributed to radiation doses from the accident, for those exposed at various ages, were estimated in terms of the lifetime attributable risk (LAR). Calculations of LAR were based on recent Japanese population statistics for cancer incidence and current radiation risk models from the Life Span Study of Japanese A-bomb survivors. Cancer risks over an initial period of 15 years after first exposure were also considered. LAR results were also given as a percentage of the lifetime baseline risk (i.e., the cancer risk in the absence of radiation exposure from the accident). The LAR results were based on either a reference first year dose (10 mGy) or a reference lifetime dose (20 mGy) so that risk assessment may be applied for relocated and non-relocated members of the public, as well as for adult male emergency workers. The results show that the major contribution to LAR from the reference lifetime dose comes from the first year dose. For a dose of 10 mGy in the first year and continuing exposure, the lifetime radiation-related cancer risks based on lifetime dose (which are highest for children under 5 years of age at initial exposure), are small, and much smaller than the lifetime baseline cancer risks. For example, after initial exposure at age 1 year, the lifetime excess radiation risk and baseline risk of all solid cancers in females were estimated to be 0.7 . 10(-2) and 29.0 . 10(-2), respectively. The 15 year risks based on the lifetime reference dose are very small. However, for initial exposure in childhood, the 15 year risks based on the lifetime reference dose are up to 33 and 88% as large as the 15 year baseline risks for leukemia and thyroid cancer, respectively. The results may be scaled to particular dose estimates after consideration of caveats. One caveat is related to the lack of epidemiological evidence defining risks at low doses, because the predicted risks come from cancer risk models fitted to a wide dose range (0-4 Gy), which assume that the solid cancer and leukemia lifetime risks for doses less than about 0.5 Gy and 0.2 Gy, respectively, are proportional to organ/tissue doses: this is unlikely to seriously underestimate risks, but may overestimate risks. This WHO-HRA framework may be used to update the risk estimates, when new population health statistics data, dosimetry information and radiation risk models become available.","['Walsh, L', 'Zhang, W', 'Shore, R E', 'Auvinen, A', 'Laurier, D', 'Wakeford, R', 'Jacob, P', 'Gent, N', 'Anspaugh, L R', 'Schuz, J', 'Kesminiene, A', 'van Deventer, E', 'Tritscher, A', 'del Rosarion Perez, M']","['Walsh L', 'Zhang W', 'Shore RE', 'Auvinen A', 'Laurier D', 'Wakeford R', 'Jacob P', 'Gent N', 'Anspaugh LR', 'Schuz J', 'Kesminiene A', 'van Deventer E', 'Tritscher A', 'del Rosarion Perez M']","['a BfS - Federal Office for Radiation Protection, Radiation Protection and Health, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140924,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Fukushima Nuclear Accident', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2015/01/27 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR13779.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2014 Nov;182(5):556-72. doi: 10.1667/RR13779.1.

PROCEDURES: The SEER database was mined for all patients with neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma. Cumulative incidence of SMN was calculated with death as a competing risk. A poisson regression model was used to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals to compare the rates of SMN between patients in different Eras. RESULTS: The analytic cohort included 2,801 patients. Thirty-four patients developed a SMN, accounting for 1.2% of all patients. Of the patients who developed a SMN, 47.1% received radiation for their primary neuroblastoma. Fourteen of the SMN were carcinomas, and 10 were hematologic malignancies, with six cases of acute myelogenous leukemia. There was no difference in the incidence of SMN in Era 1 compared to Era 3 (P = 0.48). The cumulative incidence of SMN at 30 years for high-risk patients was 10.44% (95% CI 3.98-20.52%) compared to 3.57% (95% CI 1.87-6.12%) for non-high-risk patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no increase in the incidence of SMNs for children treated in the most recent treatment era as compared to earlier Eras. However, as the risk for developing SMN does not plateau, the number of SMNs will likely continue to rise in the cohort of patients treated after 1996. Comprehensive follow-up care for these survivors will be important.","['Applebaum, Mark A', 'Henderson, Tara O', 'Lee, Sang Mee', 'Pinto, Navin', 'Volchenboum, Samuel L', 'Cohn, Susan L']","['Applebaum MA', 'Henderson TO', 'Lee SM', 'Pinto N', 'Volchenboum SL', 'Cohn SL']","['Departments of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140923,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Neuroblastoma/*complications/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['SEER', 'late effects', 'neuroblastoma', 'second malignancies']",2014/09/25 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25249 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jan;62(1):128-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25249.

PROCEDURE: Cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography and levels of NT-proBNP and growth hormone (GHmax) in 18 patients, at a median of 18 years after HCT including TBI, and in 18 matched controls. RESULTS: Patients after HCT had cardiac dimensions, volumes, and left ventricular ejection fractions within normal range after correction for body size. However, compared with the control group, patients after HCT had significantly lower E/A ratio, as a measure of left ventricular diastolic function, significantly lower fractional shortening and mitral annular plane systolic excursion, as measures of left ventricular systolic function, significantly lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, as a measure of right ventricular function, and significantly higher NT-proBNP, as a measure of total cardiac function. Also, pulmonary flow acceleration time was shorter in the group after HCT, indicating possible pulmonary involvement. Heart rate was significantly higher and GHmax significantly lower in patients after HCT. CONCLUSIONS: Almost two decades after HCT, including preparative regimens with TBI, cardiac function in patients was found to be within normal range.

It has previously been suggested that infection of their respective hosts may have occurred as a result of a species jump from another, as yet unidentified vertebrate host. To investigate possible sources of these retroviruses in the Australian context, DNA samples were obtained from 42 vertebrate species and screened using PCR in order to detect proviral sequences closely related to KoRV and GALV. Four proviral partial sequences totalling 2880 bases which share a strong similarity with KoRV and GALV were detected in DNA from a native Australian rodent, the grassland melomys, Melomys burtoni. We have designated this novel gammaretrovirus Melomys burtoni retrovirus (MbRV). The concatenated nucleotide sequence of MbRV shares 93% identity with the corresponding sequence from GALV-SEATO and 83% identity with KoRV. The geographic ranges of the grassland melomys and of the koala partially overlap. Thus a species jump by MbRV from melomys to koalas is conceivable. However the genus Melomys does not occur in mainland South East Asia and so it appears most likely that another as yet unidentified host was the source of GALV.","['Simmons, Greg', 'Clarke, Daniel', 'McKee, Jeff', 'Young, Paul', 'Meers, Joanne']","['Simmons G', 'Clarke D', 'McKee J', 'Young P', 'Meers J']","['School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, Queensland, Australia.', 'Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia.', 'Ecosure, West Burleigh, Queensland, Australia.', 'Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140924,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Australia', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/*genetics', 'Hylobates/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murinae/*virology', 'Phascolarctidae/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae/classification/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Vero Cells']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0106954 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-01867 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 24;9(9):e106954. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106954. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4175076,,,"['GENBANK/KF572483', 'GENBANK/KF572484', 'GENBANK/KF572485', 'GENBANK/KF572486']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: From April 2010 to May 2011, 45 consecutive de novo pediatric AML patients were prospectively evaluated along with nine healthy controls. Immunoglobulins (Ig) (n = 45) were measured at diagnosis and day 15. RESULTS: There were 25 male and 20 female patients with a median age of 9 years (range 1-18 years). Baseline Ig did not correlate with any of the infection-related parameters during induction. At day 15, Ig levels reduced from baseline (IgG p = 0.46, IgA p = 0.027, IgM p < 0.001). Day 15 IgG levels were lower in patients with persistent fever >7 days (p = 0.029) and fungal infection (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: This is the first study which has evaluated derangement in Ig with infection-related parameters in pediatric AML. At day 15, immunoglobulins decrease and reduced IgG levels correlate with infection-related parameters. Use of intravenous immunoglobulins in pediatric AML cases needs to be further evaluated to assess whether it can reduce infection-related morbidity.","['Bansal, Anuj Kumar', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Bansal AK', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140924,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infections/*blood/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Immunoglobulin', 'induction chemotherapy', 'infection', 'pediatric acute myeloid leukemia']",2014/09/25 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2014.955620 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015 Mar;32(2):129-37. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2014.955620.

However, around 25% of patients fail to sustain an adequate response. We sought to identify gene-expression biomarkers that could be used to predict imatinib response. The expression of 29 genes, previously implicated in CML pathogenesis, were measured by TaqMan Low Density Array in 73 CML patient samples. Patients were divided into low and high expression for each gene and imatinib failure (IF), probability of achieving CCyR, progression free survival and CML related OS were compared by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank. Results were validated in a second cohort of 56 patients, with a further technical validation using custom gene-expression assays in a conventional RT-qPCR in a sub-cohort of 37 patients. Patients with low PTCH1 expression showed a worse clinical response for all variables in all cohorts. PTCH1 was the most significant predictor in the multivariate analysis compared with Sokal, age and EUTOS. PTCH1 expression assay showed the adequate sensitivity, specificity and predictive values to predict for IF. Given the different treatments available for CML, measuring PTCH1 expression at diagnosis may help establish who will benefit best from imatinib and who is better selected for second generation TKI.","['Alonso-Dominguez, Juan M', 'Grinfeld, Jacob', 'Alikian, Mary', 'Marin, David', 'Reid, Alistair', 'Daghistani, Mustafa', 'Hedgley, Corinne', ""O'Brien, Stephen"", 'Clark, Richard E', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Gerrard, Gareth']","['Alonso-Dominguez JM', 'Grinfeld J', 'Alikian M', 'Marin D', 'Reid A', 'Daghistani M', 'Hedgley C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Clark RE', 'Apperley J', 'Foroni L', 'Gerrard G']","['Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141018,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (PTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Patched Receptors)', '0 (Patched-1 Receptor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Patched Receptors', 'Patched-1 Receptor', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcriptome', 'Treatment Failure']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23857 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jan;90(1):20-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23857.

Here we show that protective antigen (PA), a component of anthrax toxin, efficiently transports commonly used antibody mimics to the cytosol of mammalian cells when conjugated to the N-terminal domain of LF (LFN). In contrast, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) was not able to deliver any of these antibody mimics into the cell cytosol. The refolding and binding of a transported tandem monobody to Bcr-Abl (its protein target) in chronic myeloid leukemia cells were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. We also observed inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity and induction of apoptosis caused by the monobody. In a separate case, we show disruption of key interactions in the MAPK signaling pathway after PA-mediated delivery of an affibody binder that targets hRaf-1. We show for the first time that PA can deliver bioactive antibody mimics to disrupt intracellular protein-protein interactions.

This review summarizes and evaluates these seminal studies. RECENT FINDINGS: The two treatment modalities most responsible for the success of immune based therapies in cancer are adoptive T-cell therapy and immunoregulatory antibodies. Specifically, immunotherapy is generating responses in malignancies that would otherwise have no traditional curative options such as CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptors to treat relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and PD-1 blockade alone or in combination to treat metastatic melanoma and other solid tumors. SUMMARY: We are at a turning point for the field of cancer immunotherapy. The scientific community is now, after decades of research, proving that these treatments have great promise for patients. Ongoing preclinical research and clinical trials over the next few years will determine the extent of impact cancer immunotherapy will have on the treatment of the general population.","['Smith, Eric L', 'Zamarin, Dmitriy', 'Lesokhin, Alexander M']","['Smith EL', 'Zamarin D', 'Lesokhin AM']","['aDepartment of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center bDivision of Gynecologic Medical Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center cDepartment of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College dDivision of Myeloma, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2015/07/16 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000128 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2014 Nov;26(6):600-7. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000128.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A randomized clinical trial.,96,10.4103/2277-9531.139678 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Although 25-33% of patients with non-hematological malignancies suffer from depression disorder, some studies have reported the rate among patients with leukemia as high as 50%. Furthermore, based on studies chronic disease such as leukemia increases the patients' spiritual needs and may accelerate the patient problems. Therefore, spirituality has a significant role in adapting to leukemia and coping with its consequent mental disorders such as depression. Owing to the spirituality aspect importance and contradictory results of previous research, this study was hence performed to determine the effects of a spiritual care program on depression of patients with leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in specialized cancer treatment center affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Isfahan, Iran). A total of 64 adult patients with leukemia were randomly divided into experiment and control groups. The spiritual care program including supportive presence and support for religious rituals was implemented for 3 days. Depression sub-scale of 42-item depression, anxiety and stress scale-42 was completed before and after the intervention for both groups. Data was analyzed using ANCOVA, Mann-Whitney U-test, Chi-square, in SPSS statistical software (version 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

The aim of this study was to establish cost-effective techniques to detect mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and a partial tandem duplication within the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL-PTD) genes in childhood AML. PROCEDURE: Ninety-nine children with newly diagnosed AML were included in this study. We developed a fluorescent dye SYTO-82 based high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis to detect FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), and NPM1 mutations. MLL-PTD was screened by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The HRM methodology correlated well with gold standard Sanger sequencing with less cost. Among the 99 patients studied, the FLT3-ITD mutation was associated with significantly worse event-free survival (EFS). Patients with the NPM1 mutation had significantly better EFS and overall survival. However, HRM was not sensitive enough for minimal residual disease monitoring. CONCLUSION: High-resolution melting was a rapid and efficient method for screening of FLT3 and NPM1 gene mutations. It was both affordable and accurate, especially in resource underprivileged regions. Our results indicated that HRM could be a useful clinical tool for rapid and cost-effective screening of the FLT3 and NPM1 mutations in AML patients.","['Liu, Yin', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Wakamatsu, Peter', 'Xue, Huiliang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Sun, Weili']","['Liu Y', 'Tang J', 'Wakamatsu P', 'Xue H', 'Chen J', 'Gaynon PS', 'Shen S', 'Sun W']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, CA , USA."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, CA , USA."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, CA , USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140909,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'MLL', 'NPM1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'childhood', 'high-resolution melting curve analysis']",2014/09/25 06:00,2014/09/25 06:01,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2014.00096 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2014 Sep 9;2:96. doi: 10.3389/fped.2014.00096. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4158872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, in many tumors some acceptable results have been showed in phase I clinical trial, closer studies are required to improve drug bioavailability, to decrease the side effects and to find the right small molecules for specific types of cancers, considering patients overall benefits as well.","['Ebrahimi, Abdolali', 'Larijani, Leila', 'Moradi, Afshin', 'Ebrahimi, Mohamad Reza']","['Ebrahimi A', 'Larijani L', 'Moradi A', 'Ebrahimi MR']","['Dept. of Pathology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Red Crescent Society of Islamic Republic of Iran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hedgehog', 'Molecular targeted therapy', 'Neoplasm']",2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2013 Winter;6(1):36-43.,,,PMC4142901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study has investigated the effects of cortisol level imbalance in behavioral and emotional adjustments. METHODS: Seventy-eight children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) have involved in this study. Their salivary cortisol level, which were sensitive to pain and disruptive behaviors, have measured. RESULTS: CORTISOL LEVEL EFFECT IN DIFFERENT PERIODS: within duration of reaction to pain, sensitivity to pain and disruptive behaviors have evaluated. In addition abnormal regulation of cortisol levels have shown a very strong relationship between sensitivity to pain and the disruptive behaviors. Cortisol suppression was responsible for adjustment by the participants to stressful conditions. CONCLUSION: Previous investigations have shown that there is a low reaction to stressor which decreases the vitality as well as impairing a negative memory in low cortisol levels. The findings of the present study demonstrated a nonlinear relation between cortisol level and sensitivity to pain as well as disruptive behaviors. Therefore, regulation of cortisol- up and down- is predisposed to maladjustment.","['Firoozi, Manijeh', 'Besharat, Mohammad Ali']","['Firoozi M', 'Besharat MA']","['Dept. of Psychology, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Psychology, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Child', 'Cortisol', 'Disruptive behavior disorder', 'Pain']",2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2013 Winter;6(1):1-7.,,,PMC4142903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review the most important cases of childhood leukaemia clusters around NPPs are described and analyzed with special emphasis on the relationship between the environmental exposure to ionizing radiation and the risk of leukaemia. Since, as indicated, a lifetime residency in the proximity of an NPP does not pose any specific health risk to people and the emitted ionizing radiation is too small to cause cancer, a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the childhood leukaemia clusters. The most likely explanation for the clusters is 'population mixing', i.e., the influx of outside workers to rural regions where nuclear installations are being set up and where local people are not immune to pathogens brought along with the incomers.","['Janiak, Marek K']",['Janiak MK'],"['Department of Radiobiology and Radiation Protection, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140225,United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood leukaemia', 'ionizing radiation exposure', 'nuclear installations']",2014/09/25 06:00,2014/09/25 06:01,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2203/dose-response.14-005.Janiak [doi]', 'drp-12-349 [pii]']",epublish,Dose Response. 2014 Feb 25;12(3):349-64. doi: 10.2203/dose-response.14-005.Janiak. eCollection 2014 Jul.,,,PMC4146329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its function in BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo is still unknown. Here we describe an important role of Grb10 in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia by using a versatile system for efficient oncogene expression and simultaneous Grb10 knockdown from a single vector. Primary bone marrow (BM) cells coexpressing Grb10-miR/BCR-ABL showed a significant decrease in colony formation and cell cycle progression. Transplantation of Grb10miR/BCR-ABL- or control-miR/BCR-ABL- transduced BM leads to a CML/B-ALL-like phenotype with significantly delayed disease onset and progression resulting in prolonged overall survival in Grb10-miR-transplanted mice. Methylcellulose experiments exhibit additive effects of imatinib treatment and Grb10 knockdown. Cell cycle analysis suggests an anti-proliferative effect of Grb10 knockdown in BCR-ABL(+) primary BM cells. However, Grb10 abrogation was not capable of completely abolishing the BCR-ABL-induced disease. Our findings were confirmed in the human BCR-ABL(+) cell line K562, where we demonstrate reduced viability, cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis by stable Grb10 microRNA expression. Taken together, our results suggest that Grb10 knockdown in vivo leads to impaired proliferation, longer survival and reduced colony formation, suggesting an important role of Grb10 in BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Illert, A L', 'Albers, C', 'Kreutmair, S', 'Leischner, H', 'Peschel, C', 'Miething, C', 'Duyster, J']","['Illert AL', 'Albers C', 'Kreutmair S', 'Leischner H', 'Peschel C', 'Miething C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '1] Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany [2] Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, HELIOS Klinikum Berlin-Buch, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140924,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Grb10 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '151441-47-3 (GRB10 Adaptor Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'GRB10 Adaptor Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014283 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.283 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):858-68. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.283.

In consequence, any learning with an abundance of normal cases and a limited set of specific anomalous cases is biased towards the types of anomalies represented in the training set. Such models do not accurately identify anomalies, whether previously known or unknown, that may exist in future samples tested. Although one-class classifiers trained using only normal cases would avoid such a bias, robust sample characterization is critical for a generalizable model. Owing to sample heterogeneity and instrumental variability, arbitrary characterization of samples usually introduces feature noise that may lead to poor predictive performance. Herein, we present a non-parametric Bayesian algorithm called ASPIRE (anomalous sample phenotype identification with random effects) that identifies phenotypic differences across a batch of samples in the presence of random effects. Our approach involves simultaneous clustering of cellular measurements in individual samples and matching of discovered clusters across all samples in order to recover global clusters using probabilistic sampling techniques in a systematic way. RESULTS: We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in identifying anomalous samples in two different FC data sets, one of which represents a set of samples including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and the other a generic 5-parameter peripheral-blood immunophenotyping. Results are evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). ASPIRE achieved AUCs of 0.99 and 1.0 on the AML and generic blood immunophenotyping data sets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that anomalous samples can be identified by ASPIRE with almost perfect accuracy without a priori access to samples of anomalous subtypes in the training set. The ASPIRE approach is unique in its ability to form generalizations regarding normal and anomalous states given only very weak assumptions regarding sample characteristics and origin. Thus, ASPIRE could become highly instrumental in providing unique insights about observed biological phenomena in the absence of full information about the investigated samples.","['Dundar, Murat', 'Akova, Ferit', 'Yerebakan, Halid Z', 'Rajwa, Bartek']","['Dundar M', 'Akova F', 'Yerebakan HZ', 'Rajwa B']","['Computer Science Department, IUPUI, 723 W, Michigan St,, 46037 Indianapolis IN, US. dundar@cs.iupui.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140924,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', '*Phenotype', 'ROC Curve', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stochastic Processes']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2014/11/09 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-15-314 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-15-314 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2014 Sep 24;15:314. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-314.,,"['R21 EB015707/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', '5R21EB015707/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4262223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effect of TRIM62 protein expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used reverse-phase protein array methodology to determine TRIM62 levels in leukemia-enriched protein samples from 511 patients newly diagnosed with AML. RESULTS: TRIM62 levels in AML cells were significantly lower than in normal CD34-positive cells, suggesting that TRIM62 loss might be involved in leukemogenesis, but was not associated with specific karyotypic abnormalities or Nucleophosmin (NPM1), Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase-3 (FLT3), or rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS) mutational status. Low TRIM62 levels were associated with shorter complete remission duration and significantly shorter event-free and overall survival rates, particularly among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In that AML subgroup, age and TRIM62 levels were the most powerful independent prognostic factors for survival. TRIM62 protein levels further refined the risk associated with NPM1 and FLT3 mutational status. TRIM62 loss was associated with altered expression of proteins involved in leukemia stem cell homeostasis (beta-catenin and Notch), cell motility, and adhesion (integrin-beta3, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate [RAC], and fibronectin), hypoxia (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha [HIF1alpha], egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1 [Egln1], and glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa [GRP78]), and apoptosis (B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BclXL) and caspase 9). CONCLUSION: Low TRIM62 levels, consistent with a tumor suppressor role, represent an independent adverse prognostic factor in AML.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Qiu, Yi Hua', 'Post, Sean', 'Creighton, Chad J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Zhang N', 'Qiu YH', 'Post S', 'Creighton CJ', 'Cortes J', 'Coombes KR', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Dan L.

Population mixing, as a possible proxy for infectious exposure, has been well researched for childhood malignancies. We aimed to investigate effects of population mixing in this older age group using an English national cancer dataset. METHODS: Cases of leukaemia, lymphoma and central nervous system (CNS) tumours amongst 15-24 year olds in England (diagnosed 1996-2005) were included in the study. Data were obtained by ward of diagnosis and linked to 1991 census variables including population mixing (Shannon index); data on person-weighted population density and deprivation (Townsend score) were also used and considered as explanatory variables. Associations between TYA cancer incidence and census variables were investigated using negative binomial regression, and results presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 6251 cases of leukaemia (21%), lymphoma (49%) and CNS tumours (30%) were analysed. Higher levels of population mixing were associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of CNS tumours (IRR=0.83, 95% CI=0.75-0.91), accounted for by astrocytomas and 'other CNS tumours'; however, there was no association with leukaemia or lymphoma. Incidence of CNS tumours and lymphoma was 3% lower in more deprived areas (IRR=0.97, 95% CI=0.96-0.99 and IRR=0.97, 95% CI=.96-0.98 respectively). Population density was not associated with the incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma or CNS tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible role for environmental risk factors with population correlates in the aetiology of CNS tumours amongst TYAs. Unlike studies of childhood cancer, associations between population mixing and the incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma were not observed.","['van Laar, Marlous', 'Stark, Daniel P', 'McKinney, Patricia', 'Parslow, Roger C', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Picton, Susan V', 'Feltbower, Richard G']","['van Laar M', 'Stark DP', 'McKinney P', 'Parslow RC', 'Kinsey SE', 'Picton SV', 'Feltbower RG']","['Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Worsley Building, Clarendon Way, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.

Compound 1 showed a 48-h IC50 value of 3.1 muM when tested against the lymphocytic leukemia cell line OSU-CLL, while the nearly identical compound 5 had almost no activity in this assay. Compounds 1 and 5 showed selective and equipotent activity against Aspergillus niger with minimum IC values of 0.05 and 0.04 mug ml(-1) (0.20 and 0.16 muM), respectively. The in vitro hemolytic activity against sheep erythrocytes of compounds 1 and 5 was investigated and were found to provoke 10% hemolysis at 52.5 and 45.0 mug ml(-1), respectively, indicative of a promising safety factor.","['El-Elimat, Tamam', 'Raja, Huzefa A', 'Figueroa, Mario', 'Swanson, Steven M', 'Falkinham, Joseph O 3rd', 'Lucas, David M', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Wani, Mansukh C', 'Pearce, Cedric J', 'Oberlies, Nicholas H']","['El-Elimat T', 'Raja HA', 'Figueroa M', 'Swanson SM', 'Falkinham JO 3rd', 'Lucas DM', 'Grever MR', 'Wani MC', 'Pearce CJ', 'Oberlies NH']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Natural Products Laboratory, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'Mycosynthetix Inc., Hillsborough, NC, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140924,Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Aspergillus/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mitosporic Fungi/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2014/09/25 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ja2014125 [pii]', '10.1038/ja.2014.125 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2015 Mar;68(3):191-6. doi: 10.1038/ja.2014.125.

Many CVD risk factors show improvements after GH therapy. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) has been recorded both in patients with isolated GHD and in those with multiple pituitary deficiencies, indicating that GHD per se is responsible for the low BMD in both types of patients. These matters are, however, more complicated, as hypopituitary patients with GHD may have different phenotypes due to differences in underlying diagnoses. These phenotypes may not be clear-cut in individual patients. Moreover, patients may transit between different phenotypes over time due to extension of the pathology in the pituitary and/or the consequences of the treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy). Three different phenotypes of hypopituitary patients will be discussed, with a focus on CVD risk and bone health: (1) patients with isolated GHD, e.g. due to prophylactic cranial radiotherapy for lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood; (2) patients with GHD and multiple hormone deficiencies due to pituitary macroadenomas treated by surgery; (3) patients with GHD caused by craniopharyngiomas with multiple hormone deficiencies and hypothalamic involvement, where hypothalamic damage frequently dominates the positive metabolic effects of GH therapy. These phenotypes illustrate the differential impact of various pituitary pathologies on the phenotype of patients with GHD.","['Erfurth, Eva-Marie']",['Erfurth EM'],"['Department of Endocrinology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

This study examined 5 cases of spontaneous malignant lymphoma in Japanese macaques, focusing on the immunophenotypes and presence of simian lymphocryptoviruses, which are Epstein-Barr virus-related herpesviruses in nonhuman primates. The macaques with lymphoma were 5 to 28 years old, indicating that lymphomas develop over a wide age range. The common macroscopic findings were splenomegaly and enlargement of lymph nodes. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that all cases were non-Hodgkin type and exhibited a T-cell phenotype, positive for CD3 but negative for CD20 and CD79alpha. The lymphomas exhibited diverse cellular morphologies and were subdivided into 3 types according to the World Health Organization classification. These included 3 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified; 1 case of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia; and 1 case of an unclassifiable T-cell lymphoma. Positive signals were detected by in situ hybridization in 2 of the 4 examined cases using probes for the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER). Furthermore, the presence of M. fuscata lymphocryptovirus 2, a macaque homolog of Epstein-Barr virus, was demonstrated in EBER-positive cases by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by direct sequencing. Immunohistochemistry using antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 2 was negative, even in the EBER-positive cases. The present study suggests that T-cell lymphoma is more common than B-cell lymphoma in Japanese macaques and that M. fuscata lymphocryptovirus 2 is present in some cases.","['Hirata, A', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Katoh, Y', 'Sakai, H', 'Bruce, A G', 'Rose, T M', 'Kaneko, A', 'Suzuki, J', 'Nikami, H', 'Yanai, T']","['Hirata A', 'Hashimoto K', 'Katoh Y', 'Sakai H', 'Bruce AG', 'Rose TM', 'Kaneko A', 'Suzuki J', 'Nikami H', 'Yanai T']","['Division of Animal Experiment, Life Science Research Center, Gifu University, Gifu City, Gifu, Japan akatsuki@gifu-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu City, Gifu, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu City, Gifu, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu City, Gifu, Japan.', ""Center for Global Infectious Disease Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA."", ""Center for Global Infectious Disease Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama City, Aichi, Japan.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama City, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Animal Experiment, Life Science Research Center, Gifu University, Gifu City, Gifu, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu City, Gifu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140923,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary', 'In Situ Hybridization/veterinary', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocryptovirus', 'Lymphoma/complications/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary/virology', 'Macaca', 'Male', 'Monkey Diseases/diagnosis/*pathology/virology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/pathology/veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis/pathology/veterinary/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'Japanese macaque', 'T cell', 'lymphocryptovirus', 'lymphoma']",2014/09/25 06:00,2016/04/20 06:00,['2014/09/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['0300985814547389 [pii]', '10.1177/0300985814547389 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2015 May;52(3):566-72. doi: 10.1177/0300985814547389.

Other fusions of exons e1, e6, e8, e12, e19, e20 of BCR gene with exons a2 or a3 of ABL gene occur very rarely and lead to formation of so called unusual fusion BCR-ABL genes. The aim of this study is to describe long-term observations of the occurrence and routine procedure in the diagnosis of atypical variants of the fusion gene BCR-ABL in a population of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It was found that the vast majority of patients with detected BCR-ABL transcripts were b3a2 and b2a2. Other detected variants, which are described as rare were: e1a2, b2a3, b3a3, c3a2, e6a2, e6a3. At the stage of diagnosis as well as during monitoring of the effects of treatment, molecular methods which are based on polymerase chain reaction were used (multiplex RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, RQ-PCR). Multiplex RT-PCR reaction gave possibility to detect variants of the fusion BCR-ABL gene in one reaction and was crucial in the selection of appropriate test used for further monitoring of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment.

Both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia share heterogeneous outcomes, and the use of prognostic biomarkers to better stratify risk in these patients has now become commonplace. OBJECTIVE: To review chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma biomarkers commonly used in the clinical laboratory, which can be divided into the following 3 main groups by testing methodology: chromosomal based (including fluorescence in situ hybridization and cytogenetics), expression based (including immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry), and DNA based (including gene sequencing for somatic mutations and IGVH mutational status). DATA SOURCES: Review of recent literature. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, important biomarkers include expression of CD38 and ZAP-70, IGVH mutational status, somatic mutations in TP53 and NOTCH1, and abnormalities in chromosomes 11, 12, 13q, and 17. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, important biomarkers include chromosomal rearrangement of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC and expression of CD5, BCL2, and CD43, as well as somatic mutations in TP53 and BCL6.","['Chastain, Elizabeth C', 'Duncavage, Eric J']","['Chastain EC', 'Duncavage EJ']","['From the Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140923,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2014-0086-RA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2015 May;139(5):602-7. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2014-0086-RA.

The purpose of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CsA and establish a CsA population pharmacokinetic model that could be used for personalized therapy in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) patients. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from 117 allo-HSCT patients. The data analysis was performed using NONMEM software. A first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCE-I) method within NONMEM was used to estimate the parameters. The covariates, including demographics, hematological indices, biochemical levels, concurrent drugs, and genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, were evaluated quantitatively. The stability of the final model was validated by a nonparametric bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: A total of 1,571 observed concentrations were collected. A 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described the pharmacokinetics of CsA. The typical values for clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and bioavailability were 29.6 L/hr, 605 L, and 0.619, respectively. The interindividual variability of these parameters was 20.4, 66.1, and 30.4%, respectively. The residual error was 31.4% and 23.7 ng/mL. The duration of CsA therapy, hematocrit, antifungal agent administration, triglycerides, and weight were identified as the main covariates that influenced CL, and hematocrit had a significant effect on V. The internal validation showed that the final model was stable and accurate. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a population pharmacokinetic model of CsA in allo-HSCT patients that could provide the foundation for personalized use of CsA in the clinic.","['Xue, Ling', 'Zhang, Wen-Wen', 'Ding, Xiao-Liang', 'Zhang, Jing-Jing', 'Bao, Jian-An', 'Miao, Li-Yan']","['Xue L', 'Zhang WW', 'Ding XL', 'Zhang JJ', 'Bao JA', 'Miao LY']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology (LX, W-WZ, X-LD, J-JZ, J-AB, L-YM), The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; and Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences (LX, W-WZ, X-LD, J-JZ, L-YM), Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/01/16 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000337 [doi]', 'S0002-9629(15)30161-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2014 Dec;348(6):448-54. doi: 10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cytokines share the cell membrane receptor subunit gp130, resulting in similar functions. The aim of this study was to compare the response to LIF and OSM in several trophoblast models with particular regard to intracellular mechanisms and invasion. Four trophoblast cell lines with different characteristics were used: HTR-8/SVneo, JEG-3, ACH-3P and AC1-M59 cells. Cells were incubated with LIF, OSM (both at 10ngmL(-1)) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 inhibitor S3I-201 (200microM). Expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 (tyr(705)) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (thr(202/204)) and the STAT3 DNA-binding capacity were analysed by Western blotting and DNA-binding assays, respectively. Cell viability and invasiveness were assessed by the methylthiazole tetrazolium salt (MTS) and Matrigel assays. Enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was investigated by zymography. OSM and LIF triggered phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2, followed by a significant increase in STAT3 DNA-binding activity in all tested cell lines. Stimulation with LIF but not OSM significantly enhanced invasion of ACH-3P and JEG-3 cells, but not HTR-8/SVneo or AC1-M59 cells. Similarly, STAT3 inhibition significantly decreased the invasiveness of only ACH-3P and JEG-3 cells concomitant with decreases in secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9.

The upregulated expression of HERG K+ channels was determined in different tumor types. Furthermore, not only full-length transcript herg1 but also a truncated isoform herg1b was shown to be expressed in cancer cells. In this study, the expression levels of herg1 and herg1b and the impact of K897T mutation on their expressions were investigated in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML). Expression levels of herg1 and herg1b isoforms were analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in pAML patients together with healthy donors, and their expressions were confirmed by western blotting. The 2690 A>C nucleotide variation in KCNH2 gene corresponding to K897T amino acid change was analyzed by PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion. herg1b overexpression was observed in tumor cells compared to healthy controls (P = .0024). However, herg1 expression was higher in healthy control cells than tumor cells (P = .001). The prevalence of polymorphic allele 897T was 26% in our patient group and 897T carriers showed increased herg1b expression compared to wild-type allele carriers. Our results demonstrate the presence of the increased levels of herg1b expression in pAML. In addition, we report for the first time that, pAML subgroup with HERG 897K/K genotype compared to 897K/T and T/T genotypes express increased levels of herg1b. In conclusion, HERG 897K/K genotype with increased level of herg1b expression might well be a prognostic marker for pAML.","['Erdem, Merve', 'Tekiner, Tugce Ayca', 'Fejzullahu, Arta', 'Akan, Gokce', 'Anak, Sema', 'Saribeyoglu, Ebru Tugrul', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Atalar, Fatmahan']","['Erdem M', 'Tekiner TA', 'Fejzullahu A', 'Akan G', 'Anak S', 'Saribeyoglu ET', 'Ozbek U', 'Atalar F']","['Department of Growth-Development and Pediatric Endocrinology, Child Health Institute, Istanbul University , Capa, Istanbul , Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140923,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",['NOTNLM'],"['HERG K+ channels', 'K897T mutation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'herg1b']",2014/09/24 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2014.949941 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015 Apr;32(3):182-92. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2014.949941.

This toxicity mechanism is related to the production of free radicals that can cause DNA damage. Methylmercury (MeHg) is one of the most toxic of the mercury compounds. It accumulates in the aquatic food chain, eventually reaching the human diet. Several studies have demonstrated that prolactin (PRL) may be differently affected by inorganic and organic mercury based on interference with various neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of PRL secretion. This study evaluated the cytoprotective effect of PRL on human lymphocytes exposed to MeHg in vitro, including observation of the kinetics of HL-60 cells (an acute myeloid leukemia lineage) treated with MeHg and PRL at different concentrations, with both treatments with the individual compounds and combined treatments. All treatments with MeHg produced a significant increase in the frequency of chromatid gaps, however, no significant difference was observed in the chromosomal breaks with any treatment. A dose-dependent increase in the mitotic index was observed for treatments with PRL, which also acts as a co-mitogenic factor, regulating proliferation by modulating the expression of genes that are essential for cell cycle progression and cytoskeleton organization. These properties contribute to the protective action of PRL against the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of MeHg.","['Silva-Pereira, Liz Carmem', 'da Rocha, Carlos Alberto Machado', 'Cunha, Luiz Raimundo Campos da Silva E', 'da Costa, Edmar Tavares', 'Guimaraes, Ana Paula Araujo', 'Pontes, Thais Brilhante', 'Diniz, Domingos Luiz Wanderley Picanco', 'Leal, Mariana Ferreira', 'Moreira-Nunes, Caroline Aquino', 'Burbano, Rommel Rodriguez']","['Silva-Pereira LC', 'da Rocha CA', 'Cunha LR', 'da Costa ET', 'Guimaraes AP', 'Pontes TB', 'Diniz DL', 'Leal MF', 'Moreira-Nunes CA', 'Burbano RR']","['Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Para, Itaituba Campus, IFPA Itaituba, Para 68180000, Brazil. lizcarme@hotmail.com.', 'Education Federal Institute, Science and Technologie of Para, Belem Campus, IFPA.

The extremely high complete remission rate resulted from targeted therapies using ATRA in combination with arsenic trioxide will likely be able to minimise or even totally eliminate the use of highly toxic chemotherapeutic agents in APL.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is the most active single agent in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the antitumor activity of which is partly dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species. Due to its multifaceted effects observed on MM cell lines and primary myeloma cells, Phase I/II trials have been conducted in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Therapy regimens varied dramatically as to the dosage of ATO and monotherapy versus combination therapy with other agents available for the treatment of MM. Although ATO-based combination treatment was well tolerated by most patients, most trials found that ATO has limited effects on MM patients. However, since small numbers of patients were randomized to different treatment arms, trials have not been statistically powered to determine the differences in progression-free survival and overall survival among the experimental arms. Therefore, large Phase III studies of ATO-based randomized controlled trials will be needed to establish whether ATO has any potential beneficial effects in the clinical setting.","['He, Xuepeng', 'Yang, Kai', 'Chen, Peng', 'Liu, Bing', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Wang, Fang', 'Guo, Zhi', 'Liu, Xiaodong', 'Lou, Jinxing', 'Chen, Huiren']","['He X', 'Yang K', 'Chen P', 'Liu B', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang F', 'Guo Z', 'Liu X', 'Lou J', 'Chen H']","[""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140910,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic trioxide', 'clinical trial', 'meta-analysis', 'multiple myeloma', 'therapy']",2014/09/24 06:00,2014/09/24 06:01,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S67165 [doi]', 'ott-7-1593 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2014 Sep 10;7:1593-9. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S67165. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4166211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that CD13 ligation by anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies can induce apoptosis in AML cells. Here, we assessed ADAM17 expression in primary blood blasts CD13+CD33+ from patients with AML. Primary AML cells expressed ADAM17 transcript and its surface expression was higher in subtype M4 (myelomonocytic) and M5 (monocytic) AML specimens than in M0 and M1/M2 (early and granulocytic) specimens. In AML cell lines defining distinct AML subfamilies (HL-60/M2, NB4/M3, THP-1/M5, U937/M5) and primary AML cells cultured ex vivo, anti-CD13 antibodies downregulated surface CD13 and ADAM17 without affecting MMP-2/-9 release. Knockdown of CD13 by siRNA prevented anti-CD13-mediated ADAM17 downregulation, indicating that CD13 is required for ADAM17 downregulation. Soluble ADAM17 was not detected in the medium of anti-CD13 treated cells, suggesting that ADAM17 was not shed. After ligation by anti-CD13, CD13 and ADAM17 were internalized. Subsequently, we found that ADAM17 interacts with CD13.

Influenza virus may produce considerable morbidity, including protracted illness and prolonged viral shedding in these patients, thus prompting higher doses and prolonged courses of antiviral therapy. This approach may promote the emergence of resistant strains. Characterization of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor (NAI)-resistant strains of influenza A virus is essential for documenting causes of resistance. In this study, using quantitative real-time PCR along with conventional Sanger sequencing, we identified an NAI-resistant strain of influenza A (H3N2) virus in an immunocompromised patient. In-depth analysis by deep gene sequencing revealed that various known markers of antiviral resistance, including transient R292K and Q136K substitutions and a sustained E119K (N2 numbering) substitution in the NA protein emerged during prolonged antiviral therapy. In addition, a combination of a 4-amino-acid deletion at residues 245 to 248 (Delta245-248) accompanied by the E119V substitution occurred, causing resistance to or reduced inhibition by NAIs (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir). Resistant variants within a pool of viral quasispecies arose during combined antiviral treatment. More research is needed to understand the interplay of drug resistance mutations, viral fitness, and transmission.","['Eshaghi, Alireza', 'Shalhoub, Sarah', 'Rosenfeld, Paul', 'Li, Aimin', 'Higgins, Rachel R', 'Stogios, Peter J', 'Savchenko, Alexei', 'Bastien, Nathalie', 'Li, Yan', 'Rotstein, Coleman', 'Gubbay, Jonathan B']","['Eshaghi A', 'Shalhoub S', 'Rosenfeld P', 'Li A', 'Higgins RR', 'Stogios PJ', 'Savchenko A', 'Bastien N', 'Li Y', 'Rotstein C', 'Gubbay JB']","['Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, Toronto, Ontario, Canada University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada jonathan.gubbay@oahpp.ca.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140922,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Acids, Carbocyclic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'L6O3XI777I (Zanamivir)', 'QW7Y7ZR15U (peramivir)']",IM,"['Acids, Carbocyclic', 'Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclopentanes/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Guanidines/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*genetics', 'Influenza, Human/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neuraminidase/chemistry/*genetics', 'Oseltamivir/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Zanamivir/therapeutic use']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.03667-14 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.03667-14 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Dec;58(12):7188-97. doi: 10.1128/AAC.03667-14.

Nevertheless, the processes underlying its benefits remain unclear. In our previous article, we described the benefits of writing; in this article, we investigate the meaning-making processes underlying the traumatic experiences of parents of children with leukemia in off-therapy. We collected the writings of 23 parents and grouped them according to the parents' psychological outcome (low/good/high) with respect to anxiety, as assessed during a follow-up. We qualitatively analyzed the texts written by parents with good psychological outcomes to highlight their main meaning-making processes, that is, how they put into words the shattering experience, reordered the events, connected their emotions and the events, reevaluated the event, and reconstructed the time process. We found that parents with low/high outcomes articulated these processes differently. Furthermore, we discussed the uses and functions of written narration for each group.","['Freda, Maria Francesca', 'Martino, Maria Luisa']","['Freda MF', 'Martino ML']","['Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Federico II University, Naples, Italy marialuisa.martino@unina.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140922,United States,Qual Health Res,Qualitative health research,9202144,,,"['Adult', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', '*Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', '*Narration', 'Parents/*psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer, psychological aspects', 'caregivers / caregiving', 'children, illness, and disease', 'constructivism', 'health and well-being', 'health promotion', 'illness and disease, experiences', 'narrative inquiry', 'trauma']",2014/09/24 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1049732314551059 [pii]', '10.1177/1049732314551059 [doi]']",ppublish,Qual Health Res. 2015 Mar;25(3):348-59. doi: 10.1177/1049732314551059.

Constitutive overexpression of SALL4 in mice induces acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, a potential benefit of using SALL4 to facilitate ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell expansion has been proposed. However, distinct roles for how SALL4 contributes to normal versus malignant processes remain undefined. Here we show that SALL4b is the predominant isoform in murine hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Overexpression of either SALL4 isoform in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors impairs hematopoietic colony formation and expansion in vitro. Lineage-negative bone marrow overexpressing SALL4b fails to engraft and reconstitute hematopoiesis when transplanted. We found that both SALL4a and SALL4b overexpression impair hematopoiesis, in part through dose-dependent repression of BMI1. Additionally, we have identified the following potential novel SALL4 target genes in hematopoiesis: ARID5B (SALL4a and SALL4b), EZH2, and KLF2 (SALL4a). Lastly, we found that SALL4 expression is variable in acute myeloid leukemia, ranging from no expression to levels comparable to embryonic stem cells. These results show that SALL4 isoforms contribute to only a subset of acute myeloid leukemia and that overexpression of SALL4 isoforms impairs hematopoiesis through repression of BMI1. Together these data demonstrate the sensitivity of hematopoiesis to appropriately balanced SALL4 expression, highlighting the importance of regulating this dynamic in potential therapeutic applications such as ex vivo stem cell expansion.","['Milanovich, Samuel', 'Peterson, Jonathan', 'Allred, Jeremy', 'Stelloh, Cary', 'Rajasekaran, Kamalakannan', 'Fisher, Joseph', 'Duncan, Stephen A', 'Malarkannan, Subramaniam', 'Rao, Sridhar']","['Milanovich S', 'Peterson J', 'Allred J', 'Stelloh C', 'Rajasekaran K', 'Fisher J', 'Duncan SA', 'Malarkannan S', 'Rao S']","[""Sanford Children's Health and Cancer Biology Research Centers, Sioux Falls, SD, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sioux Falls, SD, USA.

METHODS: Expression levels of TET2 mRNA were measured by real-time PCR in 157 adult CN-AML, and its clinical impact in CN-AML was evaluated as well. RESULTS: TET2 gene expression levels from bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) [7.29(3.41-9.99)] and CD34+ cells [6.02(5.64-6.54)] in CN-AML were significantly lower than those [BMMNCs: 8.13(6.68-9.04), P=0.026; CD34+ cells: 6.48(5.97-7.12), P=0.034] in healthy control. And TET2 mRNA level at diagnosis [7.32(6.11-8.41)] was obviously lower than that at complete remission [8.39(7.76-8.79), P<0.01]. CN-AML patients with lower levels of TET2 mRNA showed worse survival rate [(32.7+/-5.9)%] at 18-month than those with higher levels [(48.6+/-6.9)%, P=0.041]. In multivariate analysis, lower level of TET2 mRNA was an independent prognostic factor for OS [hazard ratio(HR)2.032, 95% confidence interval (CI)1.272-3.247, P=0.003] and event-free survival [HR 1.532, 95% CI 1.014-2.314, P=0.043]. CONCLUSION: The level of TET2 mRNA is significantly lower in patients with CN-AML and it is an independent negative prognostic factor. TET2 could be an important factor for the molecular-based risk stratification in CN-AML.","['Zhu, Zhijuan', 'Chen, Jian', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Chen, Feifei', 'Chen, Zhimei', 'Lou, Jiyu', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Huang, Jian', 'Qian, Wenbin', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Jin, Jie']","['Zhu Z', 'Chen J', 'Yu M', 'Chen F', 'Chen Z', 'Lou J', 'Tong H', 'Huang J', 'Qian W', 'Meng H', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.09.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Sep;35(9):802-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.09.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study investigated the effect of chemotherapy alone on body mass index (BMI) and on growth at the achievement of final height in a homogeneous cohort of Italian childhood ALL survivors. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 162 Caucasian patients treated on the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology protocols without radiotherapy between 1989 and 2000 at five Italian centers with 107 inclusions (58 males). Height- and BMI-standard deviation score (SDS) were collected at diagnosis of ALL, at the end of treatment and at the achievement of final height. Changes in height SDS and BMI SDS with time were analyzed using dependent sample Student's t-test. RESULTS: A significant reduction of height-SDS was documented during treatment in both genders. This reduction of height-SDS was not followed by an appropriate catch-up growth, despite the achievement of a mean final height within the normal range. At diagnosis females showed a lower mean BMI-SDS than males. During treatment, in the whole population, BMI-SDS increased significantly. After it, while males lost BMI-SDS, females showed its persistent increase. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL generally seemed to achieve a normal final height with a BMI within the normal range. These parameters appeared to be only minimally affected by chemotherapy. Nevertheless, height catch-up growth was not completed after chemotherapy in both genders and all patients experienced an increase of BMI-SDS during chemotherapy that only females seemed to conserve until the achievement of final height.","['Bruzzi, Patrizia', 'Predieri, Barbara', 'Corrias, Andrea', 'Marsciani, Alberto', 'Street, Maria Elisabeth', 'Rossidivita, Aurora', 'Paolucci, Paolo', 'Iughetti, Lorenzo']","['Bruzzi P', 'Predieri B', 'Corrias A', 'Marsciani A', 'Street ME', 'Rossidivita A', 'Paolucci P', 'Iughetti L']","['Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults, University of Modena & Reggio Emilia, Via del Pozzo, 71, 41124 Modena, Italy. iughetti.lorenzo@unimore.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140922,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2016/03/19 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2431-14-236 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2431-14-236 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2014 Sep 22;14:236. doi: 10.1186/1471-2431-14-236.,,,PMC4194356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 1 gene (ABCB1/MDR1), c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A and c.3435C>T, have been shown to affect cellular transport/metabolism of imatinib. The associations between these SNPs and imatinib response in CML patients have been widely evaluated, but the results were inconsistent. To derive a conclusive assessment of the associations, we performed a meta-analysis by combining data from a total of 12 reports including 1826 patients. The results showed that the 2677G allele or 3435T allele predicted a worse response to imatinib in CML patients, whereas 1236CC genotype was associated with better response in CML patients from Asian region. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A and c.3435C>T can be served as predictive markers for the therapeutical use of imatinib in CML patients.","['Zheng, Q', 'Wu, H', 'Yu, Q', 'Kim, D H Dennis', 'Lipton, J H', 'Angelini, S', 'Soverini, S', 'Vivona, D', 'Takahashi, N', 'Cao, J']","['Zheng Q', 'Wu H', 'Yu Q', 'Kim DH', 'Lipton JH', 'Angelini S', 'Soverini S', 'Vivona D', 'Takahashi N', 'Cao J']","['Clinical Research Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Departmento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas da Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20140923,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Asians/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['tpj201454 [pii]', '10.1038/tpj.2014.54 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2015 Apr;15(2):127-34. doi: 10.1038/tpj.2014.54.

IL-32alpha interacts with many intracellular molecules, but there are no reports of interaction with a transcriptional repressor BCL6. In this study, we showed that PMA induces an interaction between IL-32alpha, PKCepsilon, and BCL6, forming a trimer. To identify the mechanism of the interaction, we treated cells with various inhibitors. In HEK293 and THP-1 cell lines, treatment with a pan-PKC inhibitor, PKCepsilon inhibitor, and PKCdelta inhibitor decreased BCL6 and IL-32alpha protein expression. MAPK inhibitors and classical PKC inhibitor did not decrease PMA-induced BCL6 and IL-32alpha protein expression. Further, the pan-PKC inhibitor and PKCepsilon inhibitor disrupted PMA-induced interaction between IL-32alpha and BCL6. These data demonstrate that the intracellular interaction between IL-32alpha and BCL6 is induced by PMA-activated PKCepsilon. PMA induces post-translational modification of BCL6 by conjugation to SUMO-2, while IL-32alpha inhibits. PKCepsilon inhibition eliminated PMA-induced SUMOylation of BCL6. Inhibition of BCL6 SUMOylation by IL-32alpha affected the cellular function and activity of the transcriptional repressor BCL6 in THP-1 cells. Thus, we showed that IL-32alpha is a negative regulator of the transcriptional repressor BCL6. IL-32alpha inhibits BCL6 SUMOylation by activating PKCepsilon, resulting in the modulation of BCL6 target genes and cellular functions of BCL6.","['Park, Yun Sun', 'Kang, Jeong-Woo', 'Lee, Dong Hun', 'Kim, Man Sub', 'Bak, Yesol', 'Yang, Young', 'Lee, Hee Gu', 'Hong, JinTae', 'Yoon, Do-Young']","['Park YS', 'Kang JW', 'Lee DH', 'Kim MS', 'Bak Y', 'Yang Y', 'Lee HG', 'Hong J', 'Yoon DY']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Research Center for Women's Disease, Department of Life Systems, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, South Korea."", 'Medical Genomics Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Medical Research Center, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['2364 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2364 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Sep 30;5(18):8765-77. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2364.,,,PMC4226720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QT interval prolongation is common with ATO and can pose a barrier to effective administration. The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence, management, and clinical consequences of QT prolongation in a large cohort of patients treated with ATO. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 3,011 electrocardiograms from 113 patients with non-APL acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who were treated on a previously reported clinical trial. QT intervals were assessed using four different correction formulas, and data were correlated with clinical parameters and treatment with ATO. RESULTS: There were no clinically significant cardiac events in the study population. Of those receiving ATO therapy, 29 patients (26%) had rate-uncorrected QT values above 470 ms and 13 (12%) had values exceeding 500 ms. With the commonly used Bazett rate correction formula, 102 patients (90%) had QTc greater than 470 ms, including 74 (65%) above 500 ms. By using alternative rate correction formulas, only 24% to 32% of patients had rate-corrected QT intervals above 500 ms. CONCLUSION: QT interval prolongation is common with ATO treatment, but clinically significant arrhythmias are rare and can be avoided with appropriate precautions. Use of the Bazett correction may result in unnecessary interruptions in ATO therapy, and alternative rate correction formulas should be considered for routine electrocardiographic monitoring.","['Roboz, Gail J', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Carlin, Rebecca F', 'Samuel, Michael', 'Gale, Leanne', 'Provenzano-Gober, Juliette L', 'Curcio, Tania J', 'Feldman, Eric J', 'Kligfield, Paul D']","['Roboz GJ', 'Ritchie EK', 'Carlin RF', 'Samuel M', 'Gale L', 'Provenzano-Gober JL', 'Curcio TJ', 'Feldman EJ', 'Kligfield PD']","['Gail J.

Here, we report health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HRQOL was a secondary end point of this trial. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 was used to assess HRQOL at end of induction and after consolidation therapy. All analyses were based on 156 patients who received at least one dose of treatment, with groups defined according to randomly assigned treatment. Primary analysis was performed, estimating mean HRQOL score over time and differences between treatment arms using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Overall, 162 patients age 18 to 70 years were enrolled. Of these, 150 and 142 patients were evaluable for HRQOL after induction therapy and third consolidation course, respectively. Overall compliance with HRQOL forms was 80.1%. The largest difference, favoring patients treated with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide, was found for fatigue severity (mean score difference, -9.3; 95% CI, -17.8 to -0.7; P = .034) at end of induction therapy. This difference was also clinically relevant. HRQOL differences between treatment arms at end of consolidation showed that for several scales, differences between treatment arms were marginal. CONCLUSION: Overall, current HRQOL findings further support the use of ATRA plus arsenic trioxide as preferred first-line treatment in patients with low- or intermediate-risk APL.","['Efficace, Fabio', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Cottone, Francesco', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Sica, Simona', 'Finizio, Olimpia', 'Kropp, Maria Grazia', 'Fioritoni, Giuseppe', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Efficace F', 'Mandelli F', 'Avvisati G', 'Cottone F', 'Ferrara F', 'Di Bona E', 'Specchia G', 'Breccia M', 'Levis A', 'Sica S', 'Finizio O', 'Kropp MG', 'Fioritoni G', 'Cerqui E', 'Vignetti M', 'Amadori S', 'Schlenk RF', 'Platzbecker U', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Fabio Efficace, Franco Mandelli, Francesco Cottone, and Marco Vignetti, Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell\'Adulto; Giuseppe Avvisati, Universita Campus Biomedico; Massimo Breccia, Universita ""La Sapienza,""; Simona Sica, Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore; Sergio Amadori and Francesco Lo-Coco, Universita Tor Vergata; Francesco Lo-Coco, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Roma; Felicetto Ferrara, Ospedale Cardarelli; Olimpia Finizio, Ospedale Cardarelli, Napoli; Eros Di Bona, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza; Giorgina Specchia, Universita di Bari, Bari; Alessandro Levis, Ospedale SS Antonio e Biagio, Alessandria; Maria Grazia Kropp, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese Ciaccio, Catanzaro; Giuseppe Fioritoni, Ospedale Civile, Pescara; Elisa Cerqui, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy; Richard F.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of maintenance therapy with the synthetic retinoid tamibarotene in APL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed APL in molecular remission at the end of consolidation therapy were randomly assigned to receive ATRA or tamibarotene, both orally, for 14 days every 3 months for up to 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 347 patients were enrolled. Of the 344 eligible patients, 319 (93%) achieved complete remission. After completing three courses of consolidation therapy, 269 patients underwent maintenance random assignment. The relapse-free survival (RFS) rate at 4 years was 84% for the ATRA arm and 91% for the tamibarotene arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.13). When the analysis was restricted to 52 high-risk patients with an initial WBC count >/= 10.0 x 10(9)/L, the intergroup difference was statistically significant, with 4-year RFS rates of 58% for the ATRA arm and 87% for the tamibarotene arm (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.95). For patients with non-high-risk disease, the HR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.32 to 2.01). The test for interaction between treatment effects and these subgroups resulted in P = .075. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In this trial, no difference was detected between ATRA and tamibarotene for maintenance therapy. In an exploratory analysis, there was a suggestion of improved efficacy of tamibarotene in high-risk patients, but this requires further study.","['Shinagawa, Katsuji', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Ueda, Yasunori', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Miyatake, Junichi', 'Dobashi, Nobuaki', 'Kojima, Minoru', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Tamaki, Shigehisa', 'Gomyo, Hiroshi', 'Yamazaki, Etsuko', 'Fujimaki, Katsumichi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Shinagawa K', 'Yanada M', 'Sakura T', 'Ueda Y', 'Sawa M', 'Miyatake J', 'Dobashi N', 'Kojima M', 'Hatta Y', 'Emi N', 'Tamaki S', 'Gomyo H', 'Yamazaki E', 'Fujimaki K', 'Asou N', 'Matsuo K', 'Ohtake S', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Ohnishi K', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Naoe T']","['Katsuji Shinagawa, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama;

The ability of Jurkat cells to cross a human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) monolayer was almost completely abrogated by MIP-1alpha siRNA. In addition, the overexpression of MIP-1alpha resulted in the up-regulated expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, which enhanced the migration of Jurkat cells through a monolayer of HBMEC. MIP-1alpha levels in Jurkat cells appeared to be an important factor for its transendothelial migration, which may provide the theoretical basis to understand the mechanisms of brain metastases of T-ALL at cellular and molecular levels.","['Ma, Yi-Ran', 'Ma, Ying-Huan']","['Ma YR', 'Ma YH']","['Department of Transfusion, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.

A wide spectrum of infections has been associated with Aeromonas species in developing countries that include gastroenteritis, wound infections, septicemia and lung infections. This infection, caused by Aeromonas species, is usually more severe in immunocompromised than immunocompetent individuals. We here describe a case of soft tissue infection and severe sepsis due to Aeromonas sobria in an immunocompromised patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old Caucasian man with a clinical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immune thrombocytopenia, periodically treated with steroids, was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit because of necrotizing fasciitis and multiorgan failure due to Aeromonas sobria, which resulted in his death. The unfortunate coexistence of a Candida albicans infection played a key role in the clinical course. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical therapy are determinants in the treatment of severe septicemia caused by an Aeromonas sobria in an immunocompromised patient.","['Spadaro, Savino', 'Berselli, Angela', 'Marangoni, Elisabetta', 'Romanello, Anna', 'Colamussi, Maria Vittoria', 'Ragazzi, Riccardo', 'Zardi, Silvia', 'Volta, Carlo Alberto']","['Spadaro S', 'Berselli A', 'Marangoni E', 'Romanello A', 'Colamussi MV', 'Ragazzi R', 'Zardi S', 'Volta CA']","[""Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Sant' Anna Hospital, University of Ferrara, Via Aldo Moro 8, Ferrara, FE 44124, Italy. savinospadaro@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20140922,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['Aeromonas/*isolation & purification', 'Aged', 'Fasciitis, Necrotizing/*microbiology/surgery', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leg/diagnostic imaging/microbiology/surgery', 'Male', 'Multiple Organ Failure/*microbiology', 'Radiography', 'Sepsis/*microbiology/surgery', 'Soft Tissue Infections/*microbiology/surgery']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-8-315 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-8-315 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2014 Sep 22;8:315. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-8-315.,,,PMC4177370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore the current study investigated the outcomes of combining bortezomib with dipyridamole, a well-known antiplatelet. The co-treatment exerted a synergistic lethality in a panel of human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines of different origin. Mechanistically, dipyridamole did not modulate the proteasome inhibitory activity of bortezomib. However, dipyridamole triggered an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and co-treatment with bortezomib resulted in higher levels of ER stress than either monotherapies. Relieving ER stress with the protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide suppressed cell death. Moreover, the enhanced ER stress by the co-treatment was associated with an aggravation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Replenishing GSH pools significantly scavenged ROS and rescued the cells. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of the co-treatment was executed mainly via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with an efficient suppression of the key anti-apoptotic regulators, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2 and XIAP, driving the independence of the co-treatment-induced apoptosis of a single apoptotic trigger. Furthermore, the intrinsic potential of bortezomib to inhibit important pro-survival pathways was enhanced by dipyridamole in a GSH/ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, dipyridamole abrogated JAK2 phosphorylation indirectly and selectively in cancer cells, and the co-treatment-induced cytotoxicity was preserved in a model of stromal-mediated chemoresistance.

Here we investigated the effect of these meridianin C derivatives on adipogenesis. Strikingly, among the derivatives tested, compound 7b most strongly inhibited lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. However, meridianin C treatment was largely cytotoxic to 3T3-L1 adipocytes. On mechanistic levels, compound 7b reduced not only the expressions of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) but also the phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) and STAT-5 during adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, compound 7b repressed leptin, but not adiponectin, expression during adipocyte differentiation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a meridianin C derivative inhibits adipogenesis by down-regulating expressions and/or phosphorylations of C/EBP-alpha, PPAR-gamma, FAS, STAT-3 and STAT-5.","['Park, Yu-Kyoung', 'Lee, Tae-Yoon', 'Choi, Jong-Soon', 'Hong, Victor Sukbong', 'Lee, Jinho', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl']","['Park YK', 'Lee TY', 'Choi JS', 'Hong VS', 'Lee J', 'Park JW', 'Jang BC']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyunchung-Ro, Nam-gu, Daegu 705-717, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Science, Korea Basic Science Institute, 169-148 Gwahakro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Keimyung University, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Keimyung University, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.

Although PML-RARalpha is crucially important for pathogenesis and responsiveness to treatment, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which PML-RARalpha exerts its oncogenic potential have not been fully elucidated. Recent reports have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the precise control of gene expression and are involved in human diseases. Little is known about the role of lncRNA in APL. METHODS: We analyzed NEAT1 expression in APL samples and cell lines by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of PML-RARalpha was measured by Western blot. Cell differentiation was assessed by measuring the surface CD11b antigen expression by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: We found that nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), a lncRNA essential for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles, is significantly repressed in de novo APL samples compared with those of healthy donors. We further provide evidence that NEAT1 expression was repressed by PML-RARalpha. Furthermore, significant NEAT1 upregulation was observed during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced NB4 cell differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of NEAT1 in myeloid differentiation. We show that reduction of NEAT1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocks ATRA-induced differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that reduced expression of the nuclear long noncoding RNA NEAT1 may play a role in the myeloid differentiation of APL cells.","['Zeng, Chengwu', 'Xu, Yan', 'Xu, Ling', 'Yu, Xibao', 'Cheng, Jingjing', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zeng C', 'Xu Y', 'Xu L', 'Yu X', 'Cheng J', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140923,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (NEAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-693 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-693 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Sep 23;14:693. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-693.,,,PMC4180842,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several WAS patients lack a compatible donor and complications, such as autoimmunity, can arise in a significant fraction of HSC transplanted patients. Administration of WAS gene-corrected autologous HSC represents an alternative therapeutic approach, potentially applicable to all WAS patients. To this aim, several gene therapy approaches for WAS using initially gamma-retroviral vectors (RVs) and subsequently HIV-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) have been developed. In the present review, we will first describe the results of the preclinical studies conducted in the murine model of WAS and then discuss the outcome of different phase I/II clinical trials using RV or LV- transduced HSC. Both gene therapy approaches led to restored WASP expression, correction of functional defects and clinical improvement. While RV-mediated gene therapy was associated with a high occurrence of leukaemia, results obtained in the first patients treated with LV-based HSC gene therapy indicate a safer risk-benefit profile.","['Bosticardo, Marita', 'Ferrua, Francesca', 'Cavazzana, Marina', 'Aiuti, Alessandro']","['Bosticardo M', 'Ferrua F', 'Cavazzana M', 'Aiuti A']","['TIGET, Via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milan, Italy. a.aiuti@hsr.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,['0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/*genetics/*therapy', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family/*genetics']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CGT-EPUB-62407 [pii]', '10.2174/1566523214666140918103731 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2014;14(6):413-21. doi: 10.2174/1566523214666140918103731.,,['TGTGSK03/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY OF CASES: We present four patients who experienced symptomatic hyperammonemia after receiving either pegaspargase (three patients) or Erwinia asparaginase (one patient). Presenting symptoms included lethargy, difficulty awakening, confusion, dizziness, numbness and tingling, hallucinations, and paranoia. All patients were treated with lactulose, which led to a decrease in ammonia level and resolution of symptoms. DISCUSSION: Hyperammonemia secondary to asparaginase products has been reported in the literature. The signs and symptoms of increased ammonia should be included in consent documents and discussed with patients and their families. Monitoring of ammonia or asparagine levels may help individualize therapy with asparaginase products in the future. CONCLUSION: Hyperammonemia can occur during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with asparaginase products. Lactulose appears to be a useful treatment strategy. Further study is warranted to determine whether dose modifications are required for pegaspargase in some patients. Whether these dose modifications would be in the dose itself or frequency of administration remains to be determined.","['Nussbaum, Vicki', 'Lubcke, Nicole', 'Findlay, Russell']","['Nussbaum V', 'Lubcke N', 'Findlay R']","[""Department of Pharmacy, American Family Children's Hospital, University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, Madison, WI, USA vnussbaum@uwhealth.org."", ""Department of Pharmacy, American Family Children's Hospital, University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, Madison, WI, USA."", ""Department of Pharmacy, American Family Children's Hospital, University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, Madison, WI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140922,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperammonemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Erwinia asparaginase', 'Hyperammonemia', 'asparaginase', 'pegaspargase']",2014/09/24 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155214551590 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155214551590 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2016 Feb;22(1):161-4. doi: 10.1177/1078155214551590.

Several Wnt/beta-catenin signaling components influence hematopoietic cells fate. B-1 cells are self-renewing and spontaneously express both myeloid and lymphoid restricted transcription factors. B-1 lymphocytes play a major role in autoimmunity and are related to CD5(+) B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, such as CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Herein, we demonstrate that Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is important to B-1 cell survival in vitro. The loss of Wnt signals by quercetin treatment induces a reduction in the proliferation and survival of B-1 cells. Furthermore, the quercetin treatment diminishes IL-6 production by peritoneal cells, a cytokine important to the maintenance of B-1 cells in vitro. Importantly, the IL-6 addition to B-1 cell culture prevents cells from apoptosis, even in the presence of quercetin. These data suggest that a deregulation in beta-catenin signals could result in alterations in B-1 cell proliferation and differentiation. The correlation between Wnt/beta-catenin and IL-6 could point out a mechanism for the expansion of B-1 cells in autoimmune disease and neoplasia.","['Novo, Marilia Campos Tavares', 'Osugui, Lika', 'dos Reis, Vanessa Oliveira', 'Longo-Maugeri, Ieda Maria', 'Mariano, Mario', 'Popi, Ana Flavia']","['Novo MC', 'Osugui L', 'dos Reis VO', 'Longo-Maugeri IM', 'Mariano M', 'Popi AF']","['Disciplina de Imunologia, Departmento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Imunologia, Departmento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Imunologia, Departmento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Imunologia, Departmento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Imunologia, Departmento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Imunologia, Departmento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Brazil.

Quite often chromosomal translocations arise prenatally as first key event in multistage process of leukemogenesis. These translocations result in so called preleukemic gene fusions (PGFs), such as BCR-ABL and TEL-AML1, which generate hybrid proteins with altered properties. Critical DNA damage resulting in translocations are DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). BCR-ABL and TEL-AML1 were shown to be associated with increased constitutive DSBs in various model systems. We analyzed cells from peripheral blood and CD34-/CD34+ cells from bone marrow of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients harboring BCR-ABL or TEL-AML1. We used sensitive technique that is based on automated enumeration of DSB co-localizing proteins gammaH2AX and 53BP1, which form so called DNA repair foci. We found that level of constitutive gammaH2AX/53BP1 foci is significantly higher in cells of ALL pediatric patients than in healthy subjects.

The aim of the study described herein was to establish the overall leukemia survival rate in Puerto Rico and determine whether there are differences in leukemia survival by type of health insurance coverage. METHODS: Data for adult patients (aged > or = 20 years) diagnosed with leukemia were provided by the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry. The relative survival rates (1, 3, and 5 years) were estimated for leukemia patients (diagnosed from 2004 through 2006) by type of health insurance (government health plan [GHP] or non-government health plan [NGHP]). Relative survival is defined as observed survival in the cohort divided by expected survival in the cohort. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze the relative excess risk of death for both the GHP and the NGHP groups. RESULTS: A total of 516 leukemia patients were eligible for analysis. The overall survival rates of leukemia patients in PR for 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis were 55.8%, 40.5%, and 34.7%, respectively. Relative survival rates were lower for patients with GHP (1 year = 52.8%; 3 years = 36.4%; 5 years = 32.2%) than they were in people with NGHP (1 year = 57.5%; 3 years = 42.8%; 5 years = 36.1%). Among patients aged 65+ years, those with GHP had a 1.58-fold (95% CI: 1.11-2.27) higher risk of death than did those patients with NGHP. CONCLUSION: Several factors could explain the disparities observed in leukemia survival rates (as grouped by health insurance status) in PR. Some of them include differences in patterns of healthcare coverage, in delays in treatment, in quality of service, in risk factors, and co-morbidities present in the older population studied.","['Ortiz-Ortiz, Karen J', 'Ortiz-Martinez de Andino, Jose J', 'Torres-Cintron, Carlos R', 'Tirado-Gomez, Maribel', 'Gonzalez-Falero, Andrea', 'Caballero-Varona, Daniela', 'Ortiz, Ana Patricia', 'Perez-Rios, Naydi']","['Ortiz-Ortiz KJ', 'Ortiz-Martinez de Andino JJ', 'Torres-Cintron CR', 'Tirado-Gomez M', 'Gonzalez-Falero A', 'Caballero-Varona D', 'Ortiz AP', 'Perez-Rios N']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Puerto Rico,P R Health Sci J,Puerto Rico health sciences journal,8303541,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health/*classification', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Puerto Rico', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/24 06:00,2015/01/09 06:00,['2014/09/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,P R Health Sci J. 2014 Sep;33(3):132-5.,,['5U58DP003863-02/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific identification of leukemia stem cells and their discrimination from normal hematopoietic stem cells would greatly contribute to risk stratification and could predict possible relapses. RESULTS: For identification of leukemic stem cells, we developed flow cytometric methods using leukemic stem cell associated markers and newly-defined (light scatter) aberrancies. The nature of the putative leukemic stem cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells, present in the same patient's bone marrow, was demonstrated in eight patients by the presence or absence of molecular aberrancies and/or leukemic engraftment in NOD-SCID IL-2Rgamma-/- mice. At diagnosis (n=88), the frequency of the thus defined neoplastic part of CD34+CD38- putative stem cell compartment had a strong prognostic impact, while the neoplastic parts of the CD34+CD38+ and CD34- putative stem cell compartments had no prognostic impact at all. After different courses of therapy, higher percentages of neoplastic CD34+CD38- cells in complete remission strongly correlated with shorter patient survival (n=91). Moreover, combining neoplastic CD34+CD38- frequencies with frequencies of minimal residual disease cells (n=91), which reflect the total neoplastic burden, revealed four patient groups with different survival. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE: Discrimination between putative leukemia stem cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells in this large-scale study allowed to demonstrate the clinical importance of putative CD34+CD38- leukemia stem cells in AML. Moreover, it offers new opportunities for the development of therapies directed against leukemia stem cells, that would spare normal hematopoietic stem cells, and, moreover, enables in vivo and ex vivo screening for potential efficacy and toxicity of new therapies.","['Terwijn, Monique', 'Zeijlemaker, Wendelien', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Rutten, Arjo P', 'Snel, Alexander N', 'Scholten, Willemijn J', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['Terwijn M', 'Zeijlemaker W', 'Kelder A', 'Rutten AP', 'Snel AN', 'Scholten WJ', 'Pabst T', 'Verhoef G', 'Lowenberg B', 'Zweegman S', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140922,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Count', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107587 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-20215 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 22;9(9):e107587. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107587. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4171508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alveolar macrophage (AM) is a key component of the inflammatory process in the lungs, associated with high levels of gene expression in inflammatory lung disease and therefore an attractive target for therapeutic siRNA. Delivery of siRNA to macrophages presents a significant delivery challenge, as fully differentiated alveolar macrophages are difficult to access and transfect. In this study we engineered particles suitable for inhalation that would efficiently transfect macrophages postinhalation. The process for encapsulation of siRNA in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles (MPs) was optimized using a double emulsion technique, and the resulting particles were characterized for size, shape, aerosol characteristics, encapsulation efficiency, and integrity of encapsulated siRNA. The cell uptake of the siRNA-loaded microparticles was determined by flow cytometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and high-content analysis (HCA) with MPs capable of transfecting up to 55% of cells. Anti-TNFalpha siRNA-MPs were then prepared to study the functional activity of encapsulated siRNA in LPS-stimulated macrophages as a model of inflammation. The anti-TNFalpha siRNA-MPs were able to decrease TNFalpha expression by 45% over 48 h in the differentiated human monocytic cell line THP-1 compared to negligible knockdown using commercial transfection reagents and offered significant, sustained siRNA knockdown of TNFalpha in primary monocytes for up to 72 h.","['Kelly, Ciara', 'Yadav, Awadh B', 'Lawlor, Ciaran', 'Nolan, Katie', ""O'Dwyer, Joanne"", 'Greene, Catherine M', 'McElvaney, Noel G', 'Sivadas, Neeraj', 'Ramsey, Joanne M', 'Cryan, Sally-Ann']","['Kelly C', 'Yadav AB', 'Lawlor C', 'Nolan K', ""O'Dwyer J"", 'Greene CM', 'McElvaney NG', 'Sivadas N', 'Ramsey JM', 'Cryan SA']","['School of Pharmacy and section signDepartment of Physiology, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141013,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Aerosols)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)']",IM,"['Aerosols', '*Bioengineering', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Emulsions', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammation/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Lactic Acid/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microspheres', 'Polyglycolic Acid/*chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['TNFalpha', 'aerosol', 'high-content cell analysis', 'macrophages', 'microparticles', 'siRNA']",2014/09/23 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp500473d [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2014 Nov 3;11(11):4270-9. doi: 10.1021/mp500473d.

Rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell membranes were used as the stationary phase of a membrane affinity chromatography column to capture components with affinity for mast cells that could be involved in a degranulation reaction. The retained components were enriched and analyzed by membrane affinity chromatography with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry via a port switch valve. Suitability and reliability of the method was investigated using appropriate standards, and then, the method was applied to identify components retained from tubeimu saponin extracts. Tubeimoside A was identified in this way as a potential allergen, and degranulation assays confirmed that tubeimoside A induces RBL-2H3 cell degranulation in a dose-dependent manner. An increase in Ca(2+) influx indicated that degranulation induced by tubeimoside A is likely Ca(2+) dependent. Coupled with the degranulation assay, RBL-2H3 cell-based affinity chromatography coupled with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry is an effective method for screening and identifying allergic components from tubeimu saponin extracts.","['Zhang, Tao', 'Han, Shengli', 'Liu, Qi', 'Guo, Ying', 'He, Langchong']","['Zhang T', 'Han S', 'Liu Q', 'Guo Y', 'He L']","[""School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, P.

Wilms' tumor Ag (WT1) is overexpressed in the majority of acute leukemia and MDS patients and has been proposed as a universal diagnostic marker for detection of impending relapse. Comprehensive studies have shown that WT1 transcript levels have predictive value in acute leukemia patients in CR after chemotherapy. However, the focus of this study is the period after alloHCT for predicting relapse onset. We analyzed the accumulation of WT1 mRNA transcripts in PB of 82 leukemia and MDS patients and defined specific molecular ratios for relapse prediction. The extensively validated WT1/c-ABL ratio was used to normalize increases in WT1 transcript levels. The observed lead time of crossing or exceeding set WT1 levels is presented along with linear interpolation to estimate the calculated day the WT1 thresholds were crossed. The WT1/c-ABL transcript ratio of 50 or above yielded 100% specificity and 75% sensitivity reliably predicting future relapse with an observed average of 29.4 days (s.d.=19.8) and a calculated average of 63 days (s.d.=29.3) lead time before morphologic confirmation. A lower ratio of 20 or above gave lower specificity, but higher sensitivity (84.8% and 87.5%, respectively) identified more patients who relapsed, at earlier times, providing an earlier warning with actual average lead time of 49.1 days (s.d.=30.8) and calculated average of 78 days (s.d.=28.8). WT1 transcript levels serve as a diagnostic relapse test with greater sensitivity than the morphologic approach used in the clinic as a readout.","['Israyelyan, A', 'Goldstein, L', 'Tsai, W', 'Aquino, L', 'Forman, S J', 'Nakamura, R', 'Diamond, D J']","['Israyelyan A', 'Goldstein L', 'Tsai W', 'Aquino L', 'Forman SJ', 'Nakamura R', 'Diamond DJ']","['Division of Translational Vaccine Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Information Sciences, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Trials Office, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Translational Vaccine Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140922,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/blood', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'WT1 Proteins/*blood']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2014209 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2014.209 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 Jan;50(1):26-33. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.209.

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical histories of 58 patients undergoing autologous HSCT for APL at 21 institutions in the United States and Japan. Thirty-three (56%) of the patients received ATO-based therapy prior to stem cell collection. Delayed neutrophil engraftment occurred in 10 patients (17%): 9 of the 10 patients (90%) received prior ATO (representing 27% of all ATO-treated patients), compared with 1 of the 10 patients (10%) not previously treated with ATO (representing 4% of all ATO-naive patients; P<0.001). Compared with ATO-naive patients, ATO-treated patients experienced significantly longer times to ANC recovery (median 12 days vs 9 days, P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, the only significant independent predictor of delayed neutrophil engraftment was prior treatment with ATO (hazard ratio 4.87; P<0.001). Of the available stem cell aliquots from APL patients, the median viable post-thaw CD34+ cell recovery was significantly lower than that of cryopreserved autologous stem cell products from patients with non-APL AML. Our findings suggest that ATO exposure prior to CD34+ cell harvest has deleterious effects on hematopoietic recovery after autologous HSCT.","['Mannis, G N', 'Logan, A C', 'Leavitt, A D', 'Yanada, M',

Pluripotency can be induced in somatic cells by several approches. One of the easy ways to induce pluripotency is the exposure of the somatic cells to the embryonic stem cell (ESC) extract. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to increase the efficiency of reprogramming of granulosa cell as a differentiated cell into pluripotential state by using epigenetic modifier agents and extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human granulosa cells were cultured in the medium containing 5-Aza-Deoxycytidine and trichostatin A. Then, the cells were exposed to mouse ESCs extract and co-cultured with mouse embryonic fibroblast in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Alkaline phosphatase test and also immonohistochemistery staining for Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog were performed after 24 and 72 hours and 1 week. RESULTS: The granulosa cells showed the alkaline phosphatase activity after 24 hours and the enzyme activity maintained for 72 hours. They also expressed Oct4 after 24 hours. The cells also expressed Sox2 and Nanog, 72 hours after exposure to the ESCs extract. The expression of the pluripotency markers decreased after 1 week. It seems that the extract can induce dedifferentiation in granulosa cells and they can express the stem cell markers. Conclusion : It seems that the inhibitors of the methyl transferase (5-Aza-Deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase (trichostatin A) could delete the epigenetic markers and prepare the cells for reprogramming by administration of the extract.","['Talaei-Khozani, Tahereh', 'Kharazinejad, Ebrahim', 'Rohani, Laili', 'Vojdani, Zahra', 'Mostafavi Pour, Zohreh', 'Tabei, Seyed Ziaadin']","['Talaei-Khozani T', 'Kharazinejad E', 'Rohani L', 'Vojdani Z', 'Mostafavi Pour Z', 'Tabei SZ']","['Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Transplantation Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Reprod Med,Iranian journal of reproductive medicine,101463749,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-Aza-Deoxycytidine', 'Cell free extract', 'Embryonic stem cell', 'Reprogramming', 'Trichostatin A']",2012/05/01 00:00,2012/05/01 00:01,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Reprod Med. 2012 May;10(3):193-200.,,,PMC4165961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In up to one third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, mutation of NPM1 results in the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of mutant protein and is thought to be responsible for leukemogenesis. Deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from several plant species, has been shown to be a strong anti-tumor agent. Human leukemia cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Drug efficacy was evaluated by apoptosis and differentiation assays, and associated molecular events were assessed by Western blot. Gene silencing was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Deguelin exhibited strong cytotoxic activity in the cell line of OCI-AML3 and selectively down-regulated the NPM1 mutant protein, which was accompanied by up-regulation of the activity of caspase-6 and caspase-8 in high concentrations. Deguelin induced differentiation of OCI-AML3 cells at a nontoxic concentration which was associated with a decrease in expression of activated caspase-8, p53, p21, and the 30-kD form of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), whereas no effects were found in OCIM2 cells expressing NPM-wt. Moreover, treatment with siRNA in the NPM mutant cell line OCI-AML3 decreased expression of p53, p21, pro-caspase-8, and the 30-kD form of C/EBPalpha, and it inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation of the OCI-AML3 cells. In conclusion, deguelin is a potent in vitro inhibitor of the mutant form of NPM1, which provides the molecular basis for its anti-leukemia activities in NPM1 mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells.","['Yi, Sha', 'Wen, Lu', 'He, Jing', 'Wang, Youping', 'Zhao, Fei', 'Zhao, Jie', 'Zhao, Zichu', 'Cui, Guohui', 'Chen, Yan']","['Yi S', 'Wen L', 'He J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao F', 'Zhao J', 'Zhao Z', 'Cui G', 'Chen Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140923,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'K5Z93K66IE (deguelin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'Caspase 6/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'RNA Interference', 'Rotenone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2206-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Feb;94(2):201-10. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2206-x.

Prediction of relapse by monitoring the disease during minimal residual disease detection is challenged by clonal shifts during therapy. To overcome this, characterization of the potential relapse-initiating cells is required using both flow cytometry and molecular analysis since leukemic stem cells can be targeted both on extracellular features and on stem-cell specific signal transduction pathways.","['Wouters, Rolf', 'Cucchi, David', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Wouters R', 'Cucchi D', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Departments of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140922,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clonal shifts', 'leukemic stem cells', 'minimal residual disease', 'targeted therapy']",2014/09/23 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.959921 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Dec;7(6):791-805. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.959921.

In this study, we utilized the leukaemia cell line K562 as an in vitro cell model to investigate whether miR-21 is involved in X-ray irradiation resistance. METHODS: Retroviral transduction and antisense oligonucleotide transfection were used to overexpress or knock down miR-21 expression, respectively. An MTT assay was used to measure cell viability, and western blotting was performed to detect the expression of the miR-21 target gene, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue), and its downstream signalling components, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and AKT. RESULTS: The overexpression of miR-21 decreased the protein expression levels of PTEN, increased the phosphorylation level of AKT, and enhanced the X-ray irradiation resistance in K562 cells. In contrast, the knockdown of miR-21 increased the PTEN protein expression, reduced the phosphorylation levels of the AKT, and increased the sensitivity of K562 cells to X-ray irradiation. The overexpression of PTEN or the knockdown of AKT also increased the sensitivity of K562 cells to X-ray irradiation. CONCLUSION: By regulating the expression of its target gene PTEN, which subsequently affects the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, miR-21 exerts its regulatory role on the radiation sensitivity of K562 cells. These results may help to provide the basis for microRNA-based targeted therapies to overcome radiation resistance in tumour cells.","['Zhou, Lili', 'Bai, Haitao', 'Deng, Chong', 'Wang, Chun', 'Xu, Rang', 'Shao, Shan']","['Zhou L', 'Bai H', 'Deng C', 'Wang C', 'Xu R', 'Shao S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140920,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'X-Rays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Irradiation', 'Leukaemia', 'MicroRNA-21', 'Resistance', 'X-ray']",2014/09/23 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000201 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Jul;20(6):343-8. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000201.

It is a pleiotropic molecule that alters the synthesis of endometrial proteins and inhibits the proliferation of some cells. The present study investigated the effects of recombinant bovine IFNT on the development of early-stage bovine embryos and the molecular mechanism underlying this effect. This study demonstrated that expression of mRNA encoding type I IFN receptor subunits was detectable from d 4 to 8 in in vitro fertilized (IVF) bovine embryos. A considerable number of IVF (n = 1,941) and parthenogenetic activated (n = 1,552) bovine embryos demonstrated that supplementing the culture medium with IFNT (100 ng/mL) produced a greater percentage of blastocysts, and the total cell number within the resulting blastocysts was higher. In addition, IFNT upregulated the expression levels of both mRNA and protein for connexin 43 (GJA1) and E-cadherin (CDH1) and expression levels for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA but not for their proteins in d 8 embryos. However, IFNT inhibited mRNA expression for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), LIF receptor alpha, and the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1. We concluded that IFNT promoted the development of bovine embryos by upregulating the expression of GJA1 and CDH1. Thus, supplementing embryo cultures or transfer medium with IFNT may stimulate embryo development and improve embryo transfer efficiency.","['Bao, Zhong-Jian', 'Zhao, Shuan', 'Haq, Ihtesham Ul', 'Zeng, Shen-Ming']","['Bao ZJ', 'Zhao S', 'Haq IU', 'Zeng SM']","['National Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Laboratory of Animal Embryonic Biotechnology; National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding; Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding, and Reproduction of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China; Shenzhen Zhongshan Urology Hospital, Assisted Reproductive Technology Center, Shenzhen, 518045, China.', 'National Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Laboratory of Animal Embryonic Biotechnology; National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding; Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding, and Reproduction of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'National Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Laboratory of Animal Embryonic Biotechnology; National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding; Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding, and Reproduction of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'National Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Laboratory of Animal Embryonic Biotechnology; National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding; Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding, and Reproduction of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.

Here, we use digital footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the core RUNX1/ETO-responsive transcriptional network of t(8;21) cells. We show that the transcriptional program underlying leukemic propagation is regulated by a dynamic equilibrium between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 complexes, which bind to identical DNA sites in a mutually exclusive fashion. Perturbation of this equilibrium in t(8;21) cells by RUNX1/ETO depletion leads to a global redistribution of transcription factor complexes within preexisting open chromatin, resulting in the formation of a transcriptional network that drives myeloid differentiation. Our work demonstrates on a genome-wide level that the extent of impaired myeloid differentiation in t(8;21) is controlled by the dynamic balance between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 activities through the repression of transcription factors that drive differentiation.","['Ptasinska, Anetta', 'Assi, Salam A', 'Martinez-Soria, Natalia', 'Imperato, Maria Rosaria', 'Piper, Jason', 'Cauchy, Pierre', 'Pickin, Anna', 'James, Sally R', 'Hoogenkamp, Maarten', 'Williamson, Dan', 'Wu, Mengchu', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Ott, Sascha', 'Westhead, David R', 'Cockerill, Peter N', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Ptasinska A', 'Assi SA', 'Martinez-Soria N', 'Imperato MR', 'Piper J', 'Cauchy P', 'Pickin A', 'James SR', 'Hoogenkamp M', 'Williamson D', 'Wu M', 'Tenen DG', 'Ott S', 'Westhead DR', 'Cockerill PN', 'Heidenreich O', 'Bonifer C']","['School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK; School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Warwick Systems Biology Centre, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore, Singapore 117456, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore, Singapore 117456, Singapore.', 'Warwick Systems Biology Centre, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.

It was therefore surprising when RNAi screening revealed that suppression of citrate synthase (CS), the first TCA cycle enzyme, prevented glutamine-withdrawal-induced apoptosis. CS suppression reduced TCA cycle activity and diverted oxaloacetate, the substrate of CS, into production of the nonessential amino acids aspartate and asparagine. We found that asparagine was necessary and sufficient to suppress glutamine-withdrawal-induced apoptosis without restoring the levels of other nonessential amino acids or TCA cycle intermediates. In complete medium, tumor cells exhibiting high rates of glutamine consumption underwent rapid apoptosis when glutamine-dependent asparagine synthesis was suppressed, and expression of asparagine synthetase was statistically correlated with poor prognosis in human tumors. Coupled with the success of L-asparaginase as a therapy for childhood leukemia, the data suggest that intracellular asparagine is a critical suppressor of apoptosis in many human tumors.","['Zhang, Ji', 'Fan, Jing', 'Venneti, Sriram', 'Cross, Justin R', 'Takagi, Toshimitsu', 'Bhinder, Bhavneet', 'Djaballah, Hakim', 'Kanai, Masayuki', 'Cheng, Emily H', 'Judkins, Alexander R', 'Pawel, Bruce', 'Baggs, Julie', 'Cherry, Sara', 'Rabinowitz, Joshua D', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Zhang J', 'Fan J', 'Venneti S', 'Cross JR', 'Takagi T', 'Bhinder B', 'Djaballah H', 'Kanai M', 'Cheng EH', 'Judkins AR', 'Pawel B', 'Baggs J', 'Cherry S', 'Rabinowitz JD', 'Thompson CB']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Donald B. and Catherine C.

The analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) allows for the detection of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a blood cancer that can be fatal if left untreated. Currently, the morphological analysis of blood cells is performed manually by skilled operators. However, this method has numerous drawbacks, such as slow analysis, non-standard accuracy, and dependences on the operator's skill. Few examples of automated systems that can analyse and classify blood cells have been reported in the literature, and most of these systems are only partially developed. This paper presents a complete and fully automated method for WBC identification and classification using microscopic images. METHODS: In contrast to other approaches that identify the nuclei first, which are more prominent than other components, the proposed approach isolates the whole leucocyte and then separates the nucleus and cytoplasm. This approach is necessary to analyse each cell component in detail. From each cell component, different features, such as shape, colour and texture, are extracted using a new approach for background pixel removal. This feature set was used to train different classification models in order to determine which one is most suitable for the detection of leukaemia. RESULTS: Using our method, 245 of 267 total leucocytes were properly identified (92% accuracy) from 33 images taken with the same camera and under the same lighting conditions. Performing this evaluation using different classification models allowed us to establish that the support vector machine with a Gaussian radial basis kernel is the most suitable model for the identification of ALL, with an accuracy of 93% and a sensitivity of 98%. Furthermore, we evaluated the goodness of our new feature set, which displayed better performance with each evaluated classification model. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method permits the analysis of blood cells automatically via image processing techniques, and it represents a medical tool to avoid the numerous drawbacks associated with manual observation. This process could also be used for counting, as it provides excellent performance and allows for early diagnostic suspicion, which can then be confirmed by a haematologist through specialised techniques.","['Putzu, Lorenzo', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Di Ruberto, Cecilia']","['Putzu L', 'Caocci G', 'Di Ruberto C']","['Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Cagliari, via Ospedale 72, 09124 Cagliari, Italy.

The activity of the master regulator of this pathway, PTEN, is often impaired in T-ALL. However, experimental evidence suggests that input from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is required for sustained mTOR activation, even in the absence of PTEN. We previously reported the expression of Neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRKs) and their respective ligands in primary human leukemia samples. In the present study we aimed to dissect the downstream signaling cascades of TRK-induced T-ALL in a murine model and show that T-ALLs induced by deregulated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling acquire activating mutations in Notch1 and lose PTEN during clonal evolution. Some clones additionally lost one allele of the homeodomain transcription factor Cux1. All events independently led to a gradual hyperactivation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. We dissected the role of the individual mTOR complexes by shRNA knockdown and found that the separate depletion of mTORC1 or mTORC2 reduced the growth of T-ALL blasts, but was not sufficient to induce apoptosis. In contrast, knockdown of the mTOR downstream effector eIF4E caused a striking cytotoxic effect, demonstrating a critical addiction to cap-dependent mRNA-translation. Although high mTORC2-AKT activation is commonly associated with drug-resistance, we demonstrate that T-ALL displaying a strong mTORC2-AKT activation were specifically susceptible to 4EGI-1, an inhibitor of the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction. To decipher the mechanism of 4EGI-1, we performed a genome-wide analysis of mRNAs that are translationally regulated by 4EGI-1 in T-ALL. 4EGI-1 effectively reduced the ribosomal occupancy of mRNAs that were strongly upregulated in T-ALL blasts compared with normal thymocytes including transcripts important for translation, mitochondria and cell cycle progression, such as cyclins and ribosomal proteins. These data suggest that disrupting the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction constitutes a promising therapy strategy in mTOR-deregulated T-cell leukemia.","['Schwarzer, A', 'Holtmann, H', 'Brugman, M', 'Meyer, J', 'Schauerte, C', 'Zuber, J', 'Steinemann, D', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Li, Z', 'Baum, C']","['Schwarzer A', 'Holtmann H', 'Brugman M', 'Meyer J', 'Schauerte C', 'Zuber J', 'Steinemann D', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Li Z', 'Baum C']","['Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Dr. Bohr-Gasse 7, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140922,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/10/02 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014290 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.290 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jul;34(27):3593-604. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.290.

It is crucial to establish an expedited diagnosis as early therapeutic intervention has led to optimal patient management. In this study, we assessed the type and frequency of antigen expressions in APL and correlated these findings with genetic studies. METHODS: Multiparametric immunophenotyping was performed on 30 samples and findings were correlated with karyotypes, FISH for t(15;17) translocation and RT-PCR for PML-RARAlpha for detection of breakpoint cluster regions (bcr1,bcr2 and bcr3). RESULTS: On SSC/CD45, APL cells displayed high to moderate SSC, with the expression of CD33 (100%), CD13 (96.8%), cMPO (71%) but lacked CD34 (3.2%) and HLA-DR (9.7%). Aberrant expression of CD4 was seen in 12.9% and CD56 in 6.5% of the cases. A significant association between cumulative aberrant antigen expression and bcr1 were observed bcr1 (X2(2) =6.833,p<.05). However there were no significant association seen in bcr2 and bcr3; (X2(2) =.199,p>.05) and (X2(2)=4.599,p>.05) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry is a rapid and effective tool in detecting APL. It is interesting to note that there is significant association between cumulative aberrant antigen expression and genotype analysis. Further validation is required to corroborate this relationship.","['Ambayya, A', 'Zainina, S', 'Salmiah, M S', 'Sabariah, M N']","['Ambayya A', 'Zainina S', 'Salmiah MS', 'Sabariah MN']","['Universiti Putra Malaysia, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine And Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor 43400, Malaysia. md_sabariah@upm.edu.my.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine And Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor 43400, Malaysia.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine And Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor 43400, Malaysia.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine And Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor 43400, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Med J Malaysia,The Medical journal of Malaysia,0361547,,IM,,,,2014/09/23 06:00,2014/09/23 06:01,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med J Malaysia. 2014 Apr;69(2):64-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms of its effects are unclear. Our previous research showed that extracts of H. japonicum can induce apoptosis in leukaemia cells. We also previously systematically analysed and isolated the chemical composition of H. japonicum. METHODS: The fluorescence polarisation experiment was used to screen for inhibitors of Bcl-2 proteins which are proved as key proteins in apoptosis. The binding mode was modelled by molecular docking. We investigated the proliferation attenuating and apoptosis inducing effects of active compound on cancer cells by MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis. Activation of caspases were tested by Western blot. A broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was used to investigate the caspases-dependence. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation was performed to analyse the inhibition of heterodimerization between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with pro-apoptotic proteins. Moreover, in vivo activity was tested in a mouse xenograph tumour model. RESULT: Jacarelhyperol A (Jac-A), a characteristic constituent of H. japonicum, was identified as a potential Bcl-2 inhibitor. Jac-A showed binding affinities to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 with Ki values of 0.46 muM, 0.43 muM, and 1.69 muM, respectively. This is consistent with computational modelling results, which show that Jac-A presents a favorable binding mode with Bcl-xL in the BH3-binding pocket. In addition, Jac-A showed potential growth inhibitory activity in leukaemia cells with IC50 values from 1.52 to 6.92 muM and significantly induced apoptosis of K562 cells by promoting release of cytochrome c and activating the caspases. Jac-A also been proved that its effect is partly caspases-dependent and can disrupt the heterodimerization between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with pro-apoptotic proteins. Moreover, Jac-A dose-dependently inhibited human K562 cell growth in a mouse xenograph tumour model with low toxicity. CONCLUSION: In this study, a characteristic constituent of H. japonicum, Jac-A, was shown to induce apoptosis in leukaemia cells by mediating the Bcl-2 proteins. Therefore, we propose a new lead compound for cancer therapy with a low toxicity, and have provided evidence for using H. japonicum as an anti-cancer herb.","['Zhang, Shoude', 'Yin, Jun', 'Li, Xia', 'Zhang, Jigang', 'Yue, Rongcai', 'Diao, Yanyan', 'Li, Honglin', 'Wang, Hui', 'Shan, Lei', 'Zhang, Weidong']","['Zhang S', 'Yin J', 'Li X', 'Zhang J', 'Yue R', 'Diao Y', 'Li H', 'Wang H', 'Shan L', 'Zhang W']","['School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, 325# Guohe Road, Shanghai 200433, China. shanleicn@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140922,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (jacarelhyperol A)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Xanthenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/chemistry/metabolism']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/09/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-689 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-689 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Sep 22;14:689. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-689.,,,PMC4177598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and twenty relapse-free survivors of childhood cancer (aged 6-30 years) were included in this study. The diagnoses of patients were lymphoma, leukemia, brain tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment: group 1-chemotherapy (ChT) only (n=52) and group 2-combination therapy of ChT + radiotherapy (RT) (head/neck/thorax) (n=68). Thyroid function tests, urinary iodine levels, and thyroid gland ultrasound examinations were evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: Incidence of thyroid disease was 66% (n=79) in the survivors. The thyroid abnormalities were: hypothyroidism (HT) (n=32, 27%), thyroid nodules (n=27, 22%), thyroid parenchymal heterogeneity (n=40, 33%), autoimmune thyroiditis (n=36, 30%), and thyroid malignancy (n=3, 2%). While the incidence of HT and thyroid nodules in group 2 was significantly higher than in group 1, the incidence of thyroid parenchymal heterogeneity and autoimmune thyroiditis was similar in the two patient groups. HT and thyroid malignancy were seen only in group 2. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, a history of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), brain tumor and NPC, as well as cervical irradiation and 5000-5999 cGy doses of radiation were found to constitute risk factors for HT. History of HL and 4000-5999 cGy doses of radiation were risk factors for thyroid nodules. Head/neck irradiation and treatment with platinum derivatives were risk factors for autoimmune thyroiditis. In univariate analysis, a history of NPC, cervical + nasopharyngeal irradiation, and treatment with platinum derivatives were risk factors for thyroid parenchymal heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that there is especially an increased risk of HT and thyroid nodules in patients treated with combination therapy of ChT with head/neck/thorax RT. Although chemotherapeutic agents per se do not seem to cause HT, longer follow-up is needed to assess whether or not there is an increased risk for autoimmune thyroiditis and thyroid parenchymal heterogeneity after antineoplastic therapy.","['Caglar, Ayla Akca', 'Oguz, Aynur', 'Pinarli, Faruk Guclu', 'Karadeniz, Ceyda', 'Okur, Arzu', 'Bideci, Aysun', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Bora, Huseyin']","['Caglar AA', 'Oguz A', 'Pinarli FG', 'Karadeniz C', 'Okur A', 'Bideci A', 'Kocak U', 'Bora H']","['Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine, Pediatrics, Ankara, Turkey.

We previously reported that VPA affects hematopoietic homeostasis by inhibiting erythroid differentiation and promoting myeloid and megakaryocyte differentiation. Here, we analyzed the effect of VPA on regulatory factors involved in erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation pathways, including transcription factors and microRNAs (miRs). We demonstrate that VPA inhibited erythroid differentiation in erythropoietin (Epo)-stimulated TF1 leukemia cells and CD34(+)/hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and in aclacinomycin-(Acla)-treated K562 cells. Mir-144/451 gene expression was decreased in all erythroid and megakaryocyte models in correlation with GATA-1 inhibition. In Epo-stimulated CD34(+)/HSCs, VPA induced the expression of the ETS family transcription factors PU.1, ETS-1, GABP-alpha, Fli-1 and GATA-2, which are all known to be negative regulators of erythropoiesis, while it promoted the megakaryocytic pathway. PU.1 and ETS-1 expression were induced in correlation with miR-155 inhibition; however, the GATA-1/PU.1 interaction was promoted. Using megakaryoblastic Meg-01 cells, we demonstrated that VPA induced megakaryocyte morphological features and CD61 expression. GATA-2 and miR-27a expression were increased in correlation with a decrease in RUNX1 mRNA expression, suggesting megakaryocyte differentiation. Finally, by using valpromide and the Class I HDACi MS-275, we validated that the well-described HDACi activity of VPA is not required in the inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis. Overall, this report shows that VPA modulates the erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation program through regulatory micro-networks involving GATA and ETS transcription factors and miRNAs, notably the GATA-1/miR-144/451 axis.","['Trecul, Anne', 'Morceau, Franck', 'Gaigneaux, Anthoula', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Trecul A', 'Morceau F', 'Gaigneaux A', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Fondation Recherche Cancer et Sang, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Fondation Recherche Cancer et Sang, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Fondation Recherche Cancer et Sang, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Fondation Recherche Cancer et Sang, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Fondation Recherche Cancer et Sang, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.

In this study, 14 different missense GATA2 mutations, which were all clustered in the highly conserved N-terminal zinc finger 1 domain, were identified in 27.4, 6.7, and 1 % of patients with CEBPA (double-mut), CEBPA (single-mut), and CEBPA wild type, respectively. All but one patient with GATA2 mutation had concurrent CEBPA mutation. GATA2 mutations were closely associated with younger age, FAB M1 subtype, intermediate-risk cytogenetics, expression of HLA-DR, CD7, CD15, or CD34 on leukemic cells, and CEBPA mutation, but negatively associated with FAB M4 subtype, favorable-risk cytogenetics, and NPM1 mutation. Patients with GATA2 mutation had significantly better overall survival and relapse-free survival than those without GATA2 mutation. Sequential analysis showed that the original GATA2 mutations might be lost during disease progression in GATA2-mutated patients, while novel GATA2 mutations might be acquired at relapse in GATA2-wild patients. In conclusion, AML patients with GATA2 mutations had distinct clinic-biological features and a favorable prognosis. GATA2 mutations might be lost or acquired at disease progression, implying that it was a second hit in the leukemogenesis of AML, especially those with CEBPA mutation.","['Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lin, Yun-Chu', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Lin, Liang-In', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Chiang, Ying-Chieh', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Hou HA', 'Lin YC', 'Kuo YY', 'Chou WC', 'Lin CC', 'Liu CY', 'Chen CY', 'Lin LI', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Chiang YC', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Hsu SC', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140921,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/09/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2208-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Feb;94(2):211-21. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2208-8.

The Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) is the major oncogene protein of EBV as its expression is responsible for the induction of cell transformation, immortalization and proliferation. Arsenic trioxide was shown to induce a cytotoxic effect on nasopharyngeal cancer cells associated with LMP1 down-regulation. However, the effect of arsenic on EBV-associated lymphoproliferative malignancies has been less studied. We investigated the effect of two different arsenical compounds, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) on the induction of cell death in P3HR1 cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma derived cell line. Both compounds inhibited cell growth and induced cell death. By flow-cytometry and Western blot analysis, we provide evidence that NaAsO2 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis whereas As2O3 triggered autophagic cell death. Furthermore, we show that NaAsO2 treatment led to a dramatic decrease of the expression level of LMP1 and the cellular protein PML. Importantly, this down-regulation was associated with a reactivation of EBV lytic cycle through the induction of immediate-early proteins Zta and Rta. These results are in agreement with a model in which LMP1 maintains EBV in a latent state by stabilizing PML expression. Altogether, our results suggest that NaAsO2 would represent a better therapeutic candidate than As2O3 in EBV-induced B lymphoma for its capacity to promote viral reactivation.","['Zebboudj, Abderezak', 'Maroui, Mohamed Ali', 'Dutrieux, Jacques', 'Touil-Boukoffa, Chafia', 'Bourouba, Mehdi', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K', 'Nisole, Sebastien']","['Zebboudj A', 'Maroui MA', 'Dutrieux J', 'Touil-Boukoffa C', 'Bourouba M', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Nisole S']","['LBCM, FSB, Universite des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene (USTHB), BP 32, El Alia, Bab Ezzouar, 16111 Algiers, Algeria; INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'LBCM, FSB, Universite des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene (USTHB), BP 32, El Alia, Bab Ezzouar, 16111 Algiers, Algeria.', 'LBCM, FSB, Universite des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene (USTHB), BP 32, El Alia, Bab Ezzouar, 16111 Algiers, Algeria.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.

Here, the mechanism of curcumin-induced apoptosis was investigated in human leukemia HL60 cells and their HL60/VCR multidrug-resistant counterparts. In both cell lines curcumin induced a bi-phasic ceramide generation with a slow phase until 6 h followed by a more rapid one. The level of the ceramide accumulation correlated inversely with the cell viability. We found that the ceramide elevation resulted from multifarious changes of the activity of sphingolipid-modifying enzymes. In both cell lines curcumin induced relatively fast activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), which peaked at 3 h, and was followed by inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase activity. In addition, in HL60/VCR cells the glucosylceramide synthase activity was diminished by curcumin. This process was probably due to curcumin-induced down-regulation of P-gp drug transporter, since cyclosporine A, a P-gp blocker, also inhibited the glucosylceramide synthase activity. Inhibition of nSMase activity with GW4869 or silencing ofSMPD3 gene encoding nSMase2 reversed the curcumin-induced inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase without affecting the glucosylceramide synthase activity. The early ceramide generation by nSMase was indispensable for the later lipid accumulation, modulation of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase 3 levels, and for reduction of cell viability in curcumin-treated cells, as all these events were inhibited by GW4869 or nSMase2 depletion. These data indicate that the early ceramide generation by nSMase2 induced by curcumin intensifies the later ceramide accumulation via inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase, and controls pro-apoptotic signaling.","['Shakor, Abo Bakr Abdel', 'Atia, Mona', 'Ismail, Ismail Ahmed', 'Alshehri, Ali', 'El-Refaey, Hesham', 'Kwiatkowska, Katarzyna', 'Sobota, Andrzej']","['Shakor AB', 'Atia M', 'Ismail IA', 'Alshehri A', 'El-Refaey H', 'Kwiatkowska K', 'Sobota A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Ceramides)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glucosyltransferases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/09/22 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1388-1981(14)00184-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014 Dec;1841(12):1672-82. doi: 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.09.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA sensing by these cytosolic sensors not only leads to the initiation of the type I interferon (IFN) antiviral response and the induction of the inflammatory response, but also triggers cell death mechanisms including pyroptosis and apoptosis in retrovirus-infected cells, thereby providing important insights into the pathophysiology of chronic retroviral infection. Host restriction factors such as SAMHD1 and Trex1 play important roles in regulating innate immune sensing, and have led to the idea that innate immune defense and host restriction actually converge at different levels to determine the outcome of retroviral infection. In this review, we discuss the sensing of retroviruses by cytosolic DNA sensors, the relevance of host factors during retroviral infection, and the interplay between host factors and the innate antiviral response in different cell types, within the context of two human pathogenic retroviruses - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and human T cell-leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1).","['van Montfoort, Nadine', 'Olagnier, David', 'Hiscott, John']","['van Montfoort N', 'Olagnier D', 'Hiscott J']","['Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, 9801 Discovery Way, Port Saint Lucie, FL 34987, USA.', 'Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, 9801 Discovery Way, Port Saint Lucie, FL 34987, USA.', 'Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, 9801 Discovery Way, Port Saint Lucie, FL 34987, USA.

Approximately one-third of BLV proviruses were independently integrated within transcriptional units, and approximately 10 % were integrated near transcription start sites. Moreover, less than 7 % of BLV integration sites were located near CpG islands. BLV did not preferentially integrate into transcriptionally active regions during any of the clinical stages. At the nucleotide level, regions around BLV integration points were significantly A/T rich with weak sequence consensus. BLV preferentially integrated within long interspersed nuclear repeat elements.

Recently, an epidemiological study for MDS among A-bomb survivors was performed, and it clearly demonstrated that the exposure to external radiation significantly increased the risk of MDS.

Among the 7 patients who received haplo-SCT, 2 who were in morphologically complete remission (CR) at transplantation were conditioned with a reduced-intensity regimen, and the 5 non-CR patients were conditioned with a myeloablative regimen. Both conditioning regimens included antithymocyte globulin. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Sustained neutrophil engraftment was achieved in all 7 patients. One patient developed severe acute GVHD. Notably, only 1 patient experienced relapse, and each patient achieved longer CR duration than after the 1st transplantation. Three of the 7 patients died from treatment-related causes: acute GVHD, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, and bacterial pneumonia. At the time of analysis, the 2-year overall survival rate of these 7 patients was 42.9%.

The major initial setback was the damage caused to normal tissues; however, in recent times the use of stereotactic radiosurgery, which delivers high doses of radiation precisely to abnormal tissue targets while sparing the surrounding normal brain tissue, and particularly for surgically inaccessible tumours, has taken centre stage. Prophylactic whole brain radiation (in conjunction with aggressive chemotherapy) for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has been shown to improve patient survival, however, this is associated with complications in survivors.

Here, we addressed these questions in a B6-->B6D2F1 allo-BMT model. Although aFGF administration attenuated GVHD in non-leukemic recipients, aFGF treatment markedly accelerated death in mice that received recipient-type tumor (P815) cells along with allo- or syngeneic-BMT. Similar protection against GVHD was achieved by administration of a non-mitogenic form of aFGF (naFGF). Importantly, GVT effects were fully preserved in naFGF-treated recipients. Furthermore, aFGF, but not naFGF, significantly enhanced P815 cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that the tumor-promoting, but not GVHD-protecting, effect of aFGF largely depends on its mitogenic activity, and suggest that naFGF may provide a safer approach to inhibiting GVHD in patients with malignancies.","['Wang, Yi', 'Wang, Hui', 'Ren, Luqing', 'Weng, Qiaoyou', 'Bao, Yuyan', 'Tian, Haishan', 'Yang, Yong-Guang', 'Li, Xiaokun']","['Wang Y', 'Wang H', 'Ren L', 'Weng Q', 'Bao Y', 'Tian H', 'Yang YG', 'Li X']","['Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, PR China; Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.', 'Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, PR China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, PR China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, PR China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, PR China.', 'Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, PR China.

However multidrug resistance (MDR) is still a major hurdle for patients receiving chemotherapy. In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of the methanol extracts of four dietary Aframomum plant species (A. arundinaceum, A. alboviolaceum, A. kayserianum and A. polyanthum) against nine sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines. We have also identified the bioactive constituents of A. arundinaceum. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the methanol extracts of the above plants was determined using a resazurin reduction assay. Chromatographic techniques were used to isolate the constituents of A. arundinaceum. RESULTS: A preliminary experiment on leukemia CCRF-CEM cells at 40 mug/mL showed that the extracts from A. kayserianum and A. alboviolaceum as well as the isolated compounds namely compounds aframodial (1), 8(17),12-labdadien-15,16-dial (2), galanolactone (3), 1-p-menthene-3,6-diol (6) and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (7) were less active, inducing more than 50% growth of this cell line contrary to A. polyanthum and A. arundinaceum extracts, galanals A (4) and B (5), naringenin (8) and kaempferol-3,7,4'-trimethylether (9). The IC50 values below or around 30 mug/mL were recorded with A. arundinaceum extract against eight of the nine tested cancer cell lines. This extract as well as compound 8 displayed IC50 values below 40 mug/mL towards the nine tested cancer cell lines whilst A. polyanthum extract, compounds 4, 5 and 9 showed selective activities. Collateral sensitivity (hypersensitivity) was observed with A. arundinaceum extract towards leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells and glioblastoma U87MG.DeltaEGFR compared to their respective sensitive counterparts CEM/CEM and U87MG.

The aim of our study is to investigate the ability of the bioactive saffron's constituents, crocin (CRC) and safranal (SFR), to inhibit the Bcr-Abl protein activity employing an in silico approach, as well as the in vitro effect of these compounds on K-562 growth and gene expression of Bcr-Abl. In silico molecular docking studies revealed that mostly SFR can be attached to Bcr-Abl protein, positioned inside the protein's binding cavity at the same place with the drug used in the treatment of CML, imatinib mesylate (IM). The predicted polar interactions and hydrophobic contacts constructing a hydrophobic cavity inside the active site, explain the observed inhibitory activity. Cytotoxicity experiments showed that SFR and CRC mediate cytotoxic response to K562 cells. In vitro studies on the expression of Bcr-Abl gene revealed that SFR and in a lesser degree IM inhibited the expression of the gene, while in contrast CRC induced an increase. The ultimate goal was to evaluate the existence of a potential antitumor activity of saffron's constituents SFR and CRC.","['Geromichalos, George D', 'Papadopoulos, Theophanis', 'Sahpazidou, Despina', 'Sinakos, Zacharias']","['Geromichalos GD', 'Papadopoulos T', 'Sahpazidou D', 'Sinakos Z']","['Cell Culture, Molecular Modelling and Drug Design Lab, Symeonidion Research Center, Theagenion Cancer Hospital, Thessaloniki 54007, Greece.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with relapsed and refractory lymphoproliferative diseases received perifosine (50 mg twice daily) for 1 month. Patients achieving less than partial response (PR) after perifosine alone were administered the combination therapy [perifosine plus sorafenib (400 mg twice daily)] until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The pERK and pAKT in peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as serum cytokine levels were investigated as predictive biomarkers of response. RESULTS: Forty patients enrolled in this study. After 1 month of perifosine alone, 36 who achieved less than PR went on to combination therapy, whereas four patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who achieved PR continued with perifosine alone for a median of 10 months (range, 4-21). The most common drug-related toxicities were grade 1-2 anemia (17%), thrombocytopenia (9%), diarrhea (25%), joint pain (22%), and hand-foot skin reaction (25%). Three patients experienced grade 3 pneumonitis. Eight patients (22%) achieved PR, 15 (42%) achieved stable disease, and 13 (36%) experienced PD. A 28% PR rate was recorded for 25 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Among all patients, median overall survival and progression-free survival were 16 and 5 months, respectively. Early reductions in pERK and pAKT significantly correlated with the probability of clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Perifosine and sorafenib combination therapy is feasible with manageable toxicity and demonstrates promising activity in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. The predictive value of pERK and pAKT should be confirmed in a larger patient cohort.","['Guidetti, Anna', 'Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Locatelli, Silvia L', 'Malorni, Walter', 'Mortarini, Roberta', 'Viviani, Simonetta', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Marchiano, Alfonso', 'Sorasio, Roberto', 'Dodero, Anna', 'Farina, Lucia', 'Giordano, Laura', 'Di Nicola, Massimo', 'Anichini, Andrea', 'Corradini, Paolo', 'Gianni, Alessandro M']","['Guidetti A', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Locatelli SL', 'Malorni W', 'Mortarini R', 'Viviani S', 'Russo D', 'Marchiano A', 'Sorasio R', 'Dodero A', 'Farina L', 'Giordano L', 'Di Nicola M', 'Anichini A', 'Corradini P', 'Gianni AM']","['Medical Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy.

(Lamiaceae) is a small aromatic perennial herb typical of the Illyric-Mediterranean flora, traditionally used as remedy for cold, flu, cough, nephritis and abdominal pain. In order to carry out a thorough chemical and biological screening of the plant and to explore phenophases influence on its polyphenol content, samples of the plant were collected at different phases during its life cycle (July/October 2012 and January/April 2013). Each sample, previously extracted using a hydroalcoholic solution, was phytochemically analyzed for its metabolic constitution applying LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS techniques. Although identified metabolites were differently concentrated at the various collection times, T. longicaulis leaf extracts were mainly constituted by low molecular weight phenols, and flavonoids. Rosmarinic acid was found as the main metabolite in Oct12 sample. Chemopreventive efficacy of the investigated extracts, by means of their anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities, was assessed. To this purpose, each extract underwent an extensive screening towards five human cell lines: CCRF-CEM (leukemia); U251 (glioblastoma); MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer); HCT-116 (colon cancer) and MRC-5 (lung fibroblasts) through XTT [2,3bis(2-metoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H tetrazolium hydroxide] test. The ability of the extracts to counteract cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was also evaluated by COX-2 expression assay in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. COX-2 inhibition could represent a valuable anticancer strategy as it is associated with carcinogenesis and over-expressed in a variety of human malignancies. Oct12 extract, which was particularly rich in rosmarinic acid and methylapigenin, exhibited a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effectiveness.","['Galasso, Silvia', 'Pacifico, Severina', 'Kretschmer, Nadine', 'Pan, San-Po', 'Marciano, Sabina', 'Piccolella, Simona', 'Monaco, Pietro', 'Bauer, Rudolf']","['Galasso S', 'Pacifico S', 'Kretschmer N', 'Pan SP', 'Marciano S', 'Piccolella S', 'Monaco P', 'Bauer R']","['Department of Environmental Biological and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Second University of Naples, Via Vivaldi 43, I-81100 Caserta, Italy.', 'Department of Environmental Biological and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, Second University of Naples, Via Vivaldi 43, I-81100 Caserta, Italy.

METHODS: Flow cytometry was performed on 29 newly diagnosed APLs and 93 other acute myeloid leukemias, including 25 HLA-DR- or CD34- cases. Clinical notes from referring institutions were reviewed to assess for recent ATRA administration. RESULTS: Recent ATRA therapy was documented in 17 (59%) of 29 patients with APL. The main features of untreated APL were preserved with ATRA therapy, including CD34- (83% vs 82%), HLA-DR- (83% vs 100%), and CD117+ (100% vs 77%). CD11b and CD11c were negative in all untreated APLs but positive in 76% and 88% of ATRA-treated APLs, respectively. Optimal diagnostic criteria for untreated APL (CD34- or HLA-DR- and CD11b- and CD11c-) showed 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity but were not useful after ATRA administration. The best interpretative approach to ATRA-treated APL (CD34- or HLA-DR-) showed 100% sensitivity but limited specificity (73%).

Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits the FLT3 tyrosine kinase and has shown encouraging activity in FLT3-ITD AML. We conducted a phase I trial of maintenance sorafenib after HSCT in patients with FLT3-ITD AML (ClinicalTrials.govNCT01398501). Patients received a variety of conditioning regimens and graft sources. A dose escalation 3 + 3 cohort design was used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), with an additional 10 patients treated at the MTD. Sorafenib was initiated between days 45 and 120 after HSCT and continued for 12 28-day cycles. Twenty-two patients were enrolled (status at HSCT: first complete remission [CR1], n = 16; second complete remission [CR2], n = 3; refractory, n = 3). The MTD was established at 400 mg twice daily with 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observed (pericardial effusion). Two patients died of transplantation-related causes, both unrelated to sorafenib. Two patients stopped sorafenib after relapse and 5 stopped because of attributable toxicities after the DLT period. Median follow-up for surviving patients is 16.7 months after HSCT (range, 8.1 to 35.0). There was 1 case of grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after starting sorafenib and the 12-month cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 38% (90% confidence interval [CI], 21% to 56%). For all patients, 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 85% (90% CI, 66% to 94%) and 1-year overall survival (OS) was 95% (90% CI, 79% to 99%) after HSCT. For patients in CR1/CR2 before HSCT (n = 19), 1-year PFS was 95% (90% CI, 76% to 99%) and 1-year OS was 100%, with only 1 patient who relapsed. Sorafenib is safe after HSCT for FLT3-ITD AML and merits further investigation for the prevention of relapse.","['Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Li, Shuli', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Connolly, Christine', 'Del Rio, Candice', 'Valles, Betsy', 'Curtis, Morgan', 'Ballen, Karen', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Dey, Bimalangshu R', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Joyce, Amy', 'McAfee, Steven', 'Rudek, Michelle', 'Rajkhowa, Trivikram', 'Verselis, Sigitas', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Levis, Mark', 'Soiffer, Robert']","['Chen YB', 'Li S', 'Lane AA', 'Connolly C', 'Del Rio C', 'Valles B', 'Curtis M', 'Ballen K', 'Cutler C', 'Dey BR', 'El-Jawahri A', 'Fathi AT', 'Ho VT', 'Joyce A', 'McAfee S', 'Rudek M', 'Rajkhowa T', 'Verselis S', 'Antin JH', 'Spitzer TR', 'Levis M', 'Soiffer R']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

While the severity of cytopenia varied with the therapy, the T-LGL persisted. Eight years after the initial diagnosis, she developed lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. A complete blood cell count revealed leukocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia with approximately 80% lymphocytes. In contrast to the LGL cells, the blood lymphocytes at this time were medium-large in size and had oval/irregular nuclei, condensed chromatin, indistinct nucleoli and a moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm, many with elongated vacuoles, and some with cytoplasmic projections. The abnormal lymphocytes comprised approximately 30% of the bone marrow cellularity with interstitial infiltrates/aggregates. Immunophenotypic analyses demonstrated a T-cell neoplasm with features suggestive of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) (CD4+). Cytogenetic analysis revealed a novel clone with complex abnormalities. PCR-based TRG gene rearrangement studies detected a clonal amplicon distinct from that of the preexisting T-LGL. Because of the chronological sequence of the two T-cell neoplasms, this case was initially considered an aggressive transformation of T-LGL. However, this was ultimately excluded by a discordant CD4-subset restriction and the presence of a distinct clonal identity. While these two T-cell neoplasms may have intrinsic connections, the underlying pathogenesis remains to be investigated.","['Wei, Qiang', 'Papavassiliou, Paulie', 'Rehder, Catherine', 'Sebastian, Siby', 'Wang, Endi']","['Wei Q', 'Papavassiliou P', 'Rehder C', 'Sebastian S', 'Wang E']","[""Department of Pathology, People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, People's Republic of China; Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States."", 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.

The transcription elongation factor eleven nineteen lysine-rich leukemia gene (ELL2) stimulates the processing of the secreted form of the IgH mRNA from the H chain gene. Mice (mus musculus) with the ELL2 gene floxed in either exon 1 or exon 3 were constructed and crossed to CD19-driven cre/CD19(+). The B cell-specific ELL2 conditional knockouts (cKOs; ell2(loxp/loxp) CD19(cre/+)) exhibit curtailed humoral responses both in 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl-Ficoll and in 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin immunized animals; recall responses were also diminished. The number of immature and recirculating B cells in the bone marrow is increased in the cKOs, whereas plasma cells in spleen are reduced relative to control animals. There are fewer IgG1 Ab-producing cells in the bone marrow of cKOs. LPS ex vivo-stimulated B220(lo)CD138(+) cells from ELL2-deficient mouse spleens are 4-fold less abundant than from control splenic B cells; have a paucity of secreted IgH; and have distended, abnormal-appearing endoplasmic reticulum. IRE1alpha is efficiently phosphorylated, but the amounts of Ig kappa, ATF6, BiP, Cyclin B2, OcaB (BOB1, Pou2af1), and XBP1 mRNAs, unspliced and spliced, are severely reduced in ELL2-deficient cells. ELL2 enhances the expression of BCMA (also known as Tnfrsf17), which is important for long-term survival. Transcription yields from the cyclin B2 and the canonical UPR promoter elements are upregulated by ELL2 cDNA. Thus, ELL2 is important for many aspects of Ab secretion, XBP1 expression, and the UPR.","['Park, Kyung Soo', 'Bayles, Ian', 'Szlachta-McGinn, Alec', 'Paul, Joshua', 'Boiko, Julie', 'Santos, Patricia', 'Liu, June', 'Wang, Zhou', 'Borghesi, Lisa', 'Milcarek, Christine']","['Park KS', 'Bayles I', 'Szlachta-McGinn A', 'Paul J', 'Boiko J', 'Santos P', 'Liu J', 'Wang Z', 'Borghesi L', 'Milcarek C']","['Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Urology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Shadyside Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15232.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261; and milcarek@pitt.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140919,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (ELL2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Loci', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*Unfolded Protein Response']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/09/21 06:00'],"['2014/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401608 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401608 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Nov 1;193(9):4663-74. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401608.

Sequence-specific ssDNA-binding protein 2 (SSBP2) is a candidate acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) suppressor gene located at chromosome 5q14. SSBP2 binds the transcriptional adaptor protein Lim domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) and enhances LDB1 stability to regulate gene expression. Notably, Ldb1 is essential for HSC specification during early development and maintenance in adults. We previously reported shortened lifespan and greater susceptibility to B cell lymphomas and carcinomas in Ssbp2(-/-) mice. However, whether Ssbp2 plays a regulatory role in normal HSC function and leukemogenesis is unknown. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence to demonstrate a requirement for Ssbp2 in the function and transcriptional program of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo. We found that hematopoietic tissues were hypoplastic in Ssbp2(-/-) mice, and the frequency of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor cells in bone marrow was reduced. Other significant features of these mice were delayed recovery from 5-fluorouracil treatment and diminished multilineage reconstitution in lethally irradiated bone marrow recipients. Dramatic reduction of Notch1 transcripts and increased expression of transcripts encoding the transcription factor E2a and its downstream target Cdkn1a also distinguished Ssbp2(-/-) HSPCs from wild-type HSPCs. Finally, a tendency toward coordinated expression of SSBP2 and the AML suppressor NOTCH1 in a subset of the Cancer Genome Atlas AML cases suggested a role for SSBP2 in AML pathogenesis. Collectively, our results uncovered a critical regulatory function for SSBP2 in HSPC gene expression and function.","['Li, June', 'Kurasawa, Yasuhiro', 'Wang, Yang', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Klumpp, Sherry A', 'Liang, Hong', 'Tailor, Ramesh C', 'Raymond, Aaron C', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Brandt, Stephen J', 'Davis, Richard E', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Nagarajan, Lalitha']","['Li J', 'Kurasawa Y', 'Wang Y', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Klumpp SA', 'Liang H', 'Tailor RC', 'Raymond AC', 'Estrov Z', 'Brandt SJ', 'Davis RE', 'Zweidler-McKay P', 'Amin HM', 'Nagarajan L']","['Department of Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Radiation Physics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; and.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; Graduate Program in Genes and Development, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; Graduate Program in Human Molecular Genetics, Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, and Center for Cancer Genetics and Genomics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030 lnagaraj@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140919,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Ssbp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', '*Stress, Physiological']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/09/21 06:00'],"['2014/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1300337 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1300337 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Nov 1;193(9):4654-62. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300337.

As they cannot always be cured by chemotherapy alone, leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are frequent medical indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, yet even this treatment is not capable of preventing relapse for certain. Therefore, molecular markers are used to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) to be enabled to react early to an impeding relapse. As specific markers are not always available, Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) has been suggested as a universal marker, but has not yet been established clinically. METHODS: We determined the level of WT1 gene expression in 130 children, adolescents and young adults with malignant hematological diseases prior to transplantation and evaluated its impact on patients' outcome. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used for this purpose. RESULTS: The relationship between a high level of WT1 and the cumulative incidence of relapse, event-free survival and overall survival proved to be highly significant in univariate and multivariate analyses. Forty-eight percent of all patients with high WT1 levels suffered from a relapse, whereas only eight percent showing normal WT1 levels before transplantation relapsed. The most convincing result was found for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MDS. CONCLUSION: We conclude that WT1 expression prior to transplantation qualifies as an independent prognostic factor and should be further evaluated for MRD monitoring. It might especially be useful for patients with AML or MDS missing specific markers.","['Woehlecke, Caroline', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Arndt, Clemens', 'Gruhn, Bernd']","['Woehlecke C', 'Wittig S', 'Arndt C', 'Gruhn B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Kochstr. 2, 07743, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140920,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/09/21 06:00'],"['2014/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1832-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Mar;141(3):523-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1832-y.

Although the Auto group showed a significant better prognostic profile at transplant, with longer median interval between diagnosis and time of graft, higher incidence of good-risk cytogenetics and lower number of previously transplanted patients, 3-year OS and LFS were similar between both groups (Auto: 59 +/- 6% vs. 50 +/- 6%, P = 0.45; and 57 +/- 6% vs. 46 +/- 6%, P = 0.37). In multivariate analysis, UCB allo-SCT was associated with lower relapse incidence (HR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.11-0.82, P = 0.02), but higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR: 4.16; 95% CI: 1.46-11.9, P = 0.008). Results from this large study suggest that UCB allo-SCT provides better disease control than auto-SCT, which is especially important in the setting of high-risk disease. However, this disease control advantage is counterbalanced by higher toxicity, highlighting the need for novel approaches aiming to decrease NRM after UCB allo-SCT.","['Chevallier, Patrice', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Rubio, Marie-There', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Vigouroux, Stephane', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Bay, Jacques-Olivier', 'Maury, Sebastien', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Contentin, Nathalie', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Bulabois, Claude-Eric', 'Francois, Sylvie', 'Oumedaly, Reman', 'Raus, Nicole', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Chevallier P', 'Labopin M', 'Socie G', 'Rubio MT', 'Blaise D', 'Vigouroux S', 'Huynh A', 'Michallet M', 'Bay JO', 'Maury S', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Fegueux N', 'Deconinck E', 'Contentin N', 'Maillard N', 'Bulabois CE', 'Francois S', 'Oumedaly R', 'Raus N', 'Mohty M']","[""Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire (CHU) de Nantes, Hematologie Clinique, Centre d'Investigation Clinique en Cancerologie (CI2C), Universite de Nantes and INSERM CRNCA UMR 892, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141013,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['SFGM-TC', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'autologous stem cell transplant', 'second complete remission', 'umbilical cord blood allogeneic stem cell transplantation']",2014/09/23 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/09/20 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12451 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 May;94(5):449-55. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12451.

There is significant structural similarity between the three PIM kinases (PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3) and only few amino acid differences. Although, several studies have specifically monitored the role of PIM1 in tumorigenesis, much less is known about PIM2 and PIM3. Therefore, in this study we have used in vitro cell culture models and in vivo bone marrow infection/transplantation to assess the comparative signaling and oncogenic potential of each of the three PIM kinases. All three PIM kinases were able to protect FL5.12 cells from IL3 withdrawal induced death. Interestingly, the downstream signaling cascades were indistinguishable between the three kinases. Transplantation of murine bone marrow co-expressing MYC and PIM1, PIM2 or PIM3 caused rapid and uniformly lethal myeloid leukemia. De-induction of MYC 18 days following transplantation significantly increased the survival of mice, even with continual expression of PIM kinases. Alternatively, mice treated at the pre-leukemic stage with a PIM kinase inhibitor increased the lifespan of the mice, even with continual expression of the MYC transgene. These data demonstrate the role of PIM kinases in driving myeloid leukemia, and as candidate molecules for therapy against human malignancies.","['Saurabh, Kumar', 'Scherzer, Michael T', 'Shah, Parag P', 'Mims, Alice S', 'Lockwood, William W', 'Kraft, Andrew S', 'Beverly, Levi J']","['Saurabh K', 'Scherzer MT', 'Shah PP', 'Mims AS', 'Lockwood WW', 'Kraft AS', 'Beverly LJ']","['James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work has been to assess the expression of miR-142-3p in a large panel of follicular thyroid adenomas and carcinomas and evaluate its effect on thyroid cell proliferation and target expression. DESIGN: The expression of miR-142-3p was analyzed by qRT-PCR in thyroid follicular adenomas and carcinomas, compared to normal thyroids. MiR-142-3p expression was restored in WRO cells and the effects on cell proliferation and target expression were evaluated. RESULTS: Here we show that miR-142-3p is downregulated in FTAs, FTCs, and FVPTCs. MiR-142-3p was demonstrated to reduce the proliferation rate of WRO and FTC133 cells, supporting its tumor suppressor role in thyroid cancerogenesis. Moreover, this microRNA was able to downregulate the expression of ASH1L and MLL1, by direct and indirect mechanisms, respectively. Consistently, an inverse correlation between miR-142-3p expression and ASH1L and MLL1 proteins was found in thyroid follicular adenomas and carcinomas. ASH1L and MLL1, which belong to the Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins and are major regulators of Homeobox gene expression, maintain active target gene transcription by histone 3 lysine 4 methylation. Interestingly, we found that FTCs and FTC cell lines express tumor specific, shorter forms of the two proteins. The capability of miR-142-3p to modulate the levels of these tumor-associated forms and to reactivate thyroid-specific Hox gene expression, likely contributes to its tumor suppressive function. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that miR-142-3p downregulation has a role in thyroid tumorigenesis, by regulating ASH1L and MLL1.","['Colamaio, Marianna', 'Puca, Francesca', 'Ragozzino, Elvira', 'Gemei, Marica', 'Decaussin-Petrucci, Myriam', 'Aiello, Concetta', 'Bastos, Andre Uchimura', 'Federico, Antonella', 'Chiappetta, Gennaro', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi', 'Torregrossa, Liborio', 'Battista, Sabrina', 'Fusco, Alfredo']","['Colamaio M', 'Puca F', 'Ragozzino E', 'Gemei M', 'Decaussin-Petrucci M', 'Aiello C', 'Bastos AU', 'Federico A', 'Chiappetta G', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Torregrossa L', 'Battista S', 'Fusco A']","['Istituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale del CNR c/o Dipartimento di Medicina Molecolare e Biotecnologie Mediche (M.C., F.P., E.R., A.U.B., A.F., S.B., A.F.), Universita degli Studi di Napoli ""Federico II,"" 80131 Naples, Italy; Department of Pathology (M.

Furthermore, I discuss the use of multiplexed assays for the quantification of antigen surrogate-antibody complexes as diagnostic tools and antigen surrogate discovery via serum screening.

Patients with ALL commonly present with easy bruising and infections due to medullary involvement. The extra medullary involvements of ALL manifests as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and testicular enlargement. Among extramedullary manifestations of the ALL, thyroid involvement is rare. Herein, we reported a case of ALL that manifested as a thyroid nodule. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old young man with a thyroid nodule presented without any other symptom or sign. The excisional biopsy of the nodule was planned by the surgeon. After two months of lost to follow-up, the patient returned with a complaint of continuous bleeding after a tooth extraction. Peripheral blood smear (PBS) study and bone marrow aspiration proposed ALL and the flow cytometry confirmed the diagnosis. The R-Hyper-CVAD induction chemotherapeutic regimen (rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) was used for treatment. Interestingly, thyroid sonography and Tc(99m) scan showed resolution of the thyroid nodule after chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: In this patient, poor interdisciplinary communication and the rarity of this manifestation led to a delayed diagnosis. Therefore, we insist on more careful clinical examinations, reassessment of unusual FNA reports, and closer communication between clinicians and pathologists in such cases. This approach would lead to accurate and earlier diagnosis and would prevent unnecessary interventions.","['Valizadeh, Majid', 'Moghimi, Minoush', 'Feizi, Abdolamir', 'Radmand, Farbod', 'Piri, Zahra']","['Valizadeh M', 'Moghimi M', 'Feizi A', 'Radmand F', 'Piri Z']","['Zanjan Metabolic Disease Research Center, Zanjan, IR Iran.', 'Zanjan Metabolic Disease Research Center, Zanjan, IR Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, IR Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, IR Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, IR Iran.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140701,Iran,Int J Endocrinol Metab,International journal of endocrinology and metabolism,101235597,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Extramedullary', 'Lymphoma', 'Thyroid Nodule']",2014/09/23 06:00,2014/09/23 06:01,['2014/09/20 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/ijem.17364 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Jul 1;12(3):e17364. doi: 10.5812/ijem.17364. eCollection 2014 Jul.,,,PMC4166040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allo-SCT has a high morbidity and is precluded for many patients because of advanced age or comorbidities. Postremission therapies with reduced toxicities are urgently needed. The murine acute leukemia model C1498 was used to study the efficacy of an intravenously administered vaccine consisting of irradiated leukemia cells loaded with the natural killer T (NKT)-cell agonist alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer). Prophylactically, the vaccine was highly effective at preventing leukemia development through the downstream activities of activated NKT cells, which were dependent on splenic langerin(+)CD8alpha(+) dendritic cells and which led to stimulation of antileukemia CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. However, hosts with established leukemia received no protective benefit from the vaccine, despite inducing NKT-cell activation. Established leukemia was associated with increases in regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and the leukemic cells themselves were highly suppressive in vitro. Although this suppressive environment impaired both effector arms of the immune response, CD4(+) T-cell responses were more severely affected. When cytarabine chemotherapy was administered prior to vaccination, all animals in remission posttherapy were protected against rechallenge with viable leukemia cells.","['Gibbins, John D', 'Ancelet, Lindsay R', 'Weinkove, Robert', 'Compton, Benjamin J', 'Painter, Gavin F', 'Petersen, Troels R', 'Hermans, Ian F']","['Gibbins JD', 'Ancelet LR', 'Weinkove R', 'Compton BJ', 'Painter GF', 'Petersen TR', 'Hermans IF']","['Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand; School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand;', 'Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand;', 'Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand; Capital and Coast District Health Board, Wellington Hospital, Wellington, New Zealand; Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand; and.', 'Ferrier Research Institute, Victoria University of Wellington, Petone, New Zealand.', 'Ferrier Research Institute, Victoria University of Wellington, Petone, New Zealand.', 'Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand;', 'Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand; School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140918,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (alpha-galactosylceramide)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*pharmacology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Galactosylceramides/*immunology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/radiation effects/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Prognosis', 'Secondary Prevention/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/09/20 06:00'],"['2014/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35409-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-568956 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 6;124(19):2953-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-568956.

We aimed to investigate the mechanisms linking ITD-FLT3 to increased cell migration toward Cxcl12. Classification of the expression of Cxcl12-regulated genes in ITD-FLT3(+) cells demonstrated that the enhanced migration of ITD-FLT3(+) cells toward Cxcl12 was associated with the differential expression of genes downstream of Cxcl12/Cxcr4, which are functionally distinct from those expressed in ITD-FLT3(-) cells but are independent of the Cxcr4 expression levels. Among these differentially regulated genes, the expression of Rock1 in the ITD-FLT3(+) cells that migrated toward Cxcl12 was significantly higher than in ITD-FLT3(-) cells that migrated toward Cxcl12. In ITD-FLT3(-) cells, Rock1 expression and Mypt1 phosphorylation were transiently up-regulated but were subsequently down-regulated by Cxcl12. In contrast, the presence of ITD-FLT3 blocked the Cxcl12-induced down-regulation of Rock1 and early Mypt1 dephosphorylation. Likewise, the FLT3 ligand counteracted the Cxcl12-induced down-regulation of Rock1 in ITD-FLT3(-) cells, which coincided with enhanced cell migration toward Cxcl12. Rock1 antagonists or Rock1 shRNA abolished the enhanced migration of ITD-FLT3(+) cells toward Cxcl12. Our findings demonstrate that ITD-FLT3 increases cell migration toward Cxcl12 by antagonizing the down-regulation of Rock1 expression. These findings suggest that the aberrant modulation of Rock1 expression and activity induced by ITD-FLT3 may enhance acute myeloid leukemia cell chemotaxis to the therapy-protective bone marrow niche, where Cxcl12 is abundantly expressed.","['Onishi, Chie', 'Mori-Kimachi, Satomi', 'Hirade, Tomohiro', 'Abe, Mariko', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Sugimoto, Toshitsugu', 'Yamaguchi, Seiji', 'Kapur, Reuben', 'Fukuda, Seiji']","['Onishi C', 'Mori-Kimachi S', 'Hirade T', 'Abe M', 'Taketani T', 'Suzumiya J', 'Sugimoto T', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Kapur R', 'Fukuda S']","['From the Departments of Oncology/Hematology and mikami@med.shimane-u.ac.jp.', 'From the Departments of Oncology/Hematology and mikami@med.shimane-u.ac.jp.', 'Pediatrics and.', 'Pediatrics and.', 'Pediatrics and.', 'Pediatrics and the Division of Blood Transfusion, Shimane University Hospital, 693-8501 Izumo, Japan, and.', 'From the Departments of Oncology/Hematology and.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.', 'Pediatrics and.', 'the Department of Pediatrics and the Herman B.

Because there are no specific tools to identify type II NKT cells, little is known about their developmental requirements and functional regulation. In our previous study, we showed that signaling lymphocytic activation molecule associated protein (SAP) is essential for the development of type II NKT cells. Here, using a type II NKT-cell TCR transgenic mouse model, we demonstrated that CD1d-expressing hematopoietic cells, but not thymic epithelial cells, meditate efficient selection of type II NKT cells. Furthermore, we showed that SAP regulates type II NKT-cell development by controlling early growth response 2 protein and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger expression. SAP-deficient 24alphabeta transgenic T cells (24alphabeta T cells) exhibited an immature phenotype with reduced Th2 cytokine-producing capacity and diminished cytotoxicity to CD1d-expressing lymphoma cells. The impaired IL-4 production by SAP-deficient 24alphabeta T cells was associated with reduced IFN regulatory factor 4 and GATA-3 induction following TCR stimulation. Collectively, these data suggest that SAP is critical for regulating type II NKT cell responses. Aberrant responses of these T cells may contribute to the immune dysregulation observed in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease caused by mutations in SAP.","['Weng, Xiufang', 'Liao, Chia-Min', 'Bagchi, Sreya', 'Cardell, Susanna L', 'Stein, Paul L', 'Wang, Chyung-Ru']","['Weng X', 'Liao CM', 'Bagchi S', 'Cardell SL', 'Stein PL', 'Wang CR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141028,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (CD1d antigen, mouse)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Sh2d1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/immunology', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/genetics/*immunology/pathology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/*immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD1d', 'Cytokines', 'NKT cell', 'SAP', 'T-cell development']",2014/09/23 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/09/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201444848 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2014 Dec;44(12):3646-57. doi: 10.1002/eji.201444848.

The enzymes deacetylating lysine residues are termed histone deacetylases (HDACs). Eighteen deacetylases have been isolated from mammalian cells. There is an intense search underway for individual functions of these enzymes and for selective histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). HDAC6 in particular has unique cytoprotective functions that rely on its ability to ensure protein homeostasis and to prevent protein aggregation. The chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) also safeguards proteins and is deacetylated by HDAC6. Current data illustrate the complexity and importance of the HDAC6-HSP90 interplay. In this review, we discuss how recently identified HSP90-dependent regulators of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of HDAC6 dictate its functions, and how HDACi-induced acetylation of HSP90 might control oncologically relevant proteins, especially in leukemic cells. Additionally, we discuss small molecules blocking HDAC6 and how such agents could become therapeutically relevant. We summarize structure-function relationships that determine the specificity of drugs against HDAC6.","['Kramer, Oliver H', 'Mahboobi, Siavosh', 'Sellmer, Andreas']","['Kramer OH', 'Mahboobi S', 'Sellmer A']","['Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Obere Zahlbacher Str. 67, 55131 Mainz, Germany.

CML is a three-stage myeloproliferative disorder caused by reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. There has been a new interest on treatment of this disorder. Therefore, in order to develop the appropriate therapy, an analysis of the molecular changes involved in malignant cells can be effective. A review of the signaling pathways, miRNA, and related targets can be helpful for better understanding of molecular pathogenesis of CML.

We assessed the risk of early and late-occurring cancers among 293 patients diagnosed with GPA from 1973 to 1999 and followed throughout 2010. METHODS: Cancer incidence in the cohort was determined by linkage with the Danish Cancer Registry and compared with that in the general population by calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 9.7 years (range 0-36). Seventy-three cancers occurred, of which 30 were non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) and 11 were bladder carcinomas. A high occurrence of NMSC was observed from the second year of follow-up onwards, with a SIR of 7.0 (95% CI 2.3, 16) for cases diagnosed >/=20 years after GPA. The incidence of bladder cancer increased after 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 years of follow-up, with SIR estimates for these latency periods of 5.3 (95% CI 1.1, 15), 14.4 (95% CI 5.3, 31) and 10.5 (95% CI 1.2, 38), respectively. The incidence of myeloid leukaemia was significantly increased during years 5-9 [SIR 23.9 (95% CI 2.7, 86)]. Increased incidence of NMSC, bladder cancer and myeloid leukaemia was observed among patients exposed to cumulative CYC doses >36 g, while the only malignancy type observed in excess among those treated with lower CYC doses was NMSC. The cancer risk among CYC-naive patients was not significantly increased. CONCLUSION: GPA patients experience a greater than expected number of specific malignancies following conventional therapies. Our analyses demonstrate a substantially increased risk of very late-occurring NMSC and bladder cancer in this patient group.","['Faurschou, Mikkel', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Voss, Anne', 'Keller, Kresten Krarup', 'Hansen, Ib Tonder', 'Baslund, Bo']","['Faurschou M', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Voss A', 'Keller KK', 'Hansen IT', 'Baslund B']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, mikkelf@dadlnet.dk.', 'Virus, Lifestyle, and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Odense University Hospital, Odense and.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140917,England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antirheumatic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Denmark', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['bladder cancer', 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'leukaemia', 'long-term follow-up', 'malignancy', 'non-melanoma skin cancer']",2014/09/23 06:00,2015/10/03 06:00,['2014/09/20 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['keu372 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/keu372 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2015 Aug;54(8):1345-50. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/keu372.

The diagnosis is exclusively based on clinical assessment with clinical diagnostic criteria such as cafe-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, axillary or groin freckling, Lisch nodules, optic pathway glioma, bony dysplasia and first-degree relative with NF1. We report a family with NF1 in which two members presented atypical clinical features in addition to the classical diagnostic criteria. Three relatives affected by NF1, a father and two of his three sons, are described. The clinical diagnosis was originally worn in all three cases, with the association many spots cafe-au -lait over the entire body and some axillary freckling as well as first-degree relative. One case presented an Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) type 2 at 10 years of age diagnosed before the revelation of bicytopenia associated pallor and isolated asthenia. A second case presented a nephrotic syndrome at 4 years of age due to the association of hydrops with headache and asthenia. Direct sequencing of NF1 led to identify the familial mutation, a previously unreported heterozygous missense mutation c.3443C > A, p.Ala1148Glu in exon 20 which segregated with all three affected patients. The family described in this report confirms the high clinical variability of NF1, even intrafamilial, and raises the question as to whether rare features such as AML and nephrotic syndrome are associated with NF1. Some NF1 patients presenting glomerular diseases or AML have rarely been reported, but due to the small number of cases described the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. However, it seems important to be aware of the possible occurrence of nephritic syndrome and/or malignant blood diseases in NF1 patients.","['Van-Gils, Julien', 'Harambat, Jerome', 'Jubert, Charlotte', 'Vidaud, Dominique', 'Llanas, Brigitte', 'Perel, Yves', 'Lacombe, Didier', 'Goizet, Cyril']","['Van-Gils J', 'Harambat J', 'Jubert C', 'Vidaud D', 'Llanas B', 'Perel Y', 'Lacombe D', 'Goizet C']","['CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Pellegrin, Service de Genetique Medicale, Centre de Reference des Anomalies du Developpement Embryonnaire, 33076 Bordeaux Cedex, France.

The transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) is well-characterized as a downstream target of Notch signaling. Hes1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-type protein, and represses target gene expression. Here, we report that deletion of the Hes1 gene in mice promotes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development induced by the MLL-AF9 fusion protein. We then found that Hes1 directly bound to the promoter region of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene and downregulated the promoter activity. FLT3 was consequently upregulated in MLL-AF9-expressing immortalized and leukemia cells with a Hes1- or RBPJ-null background. MLL-AF9-expressing Hes1-null AML cells showed enhanced proliferation and ERK phosphorylation following FLT3 ligand stimulation. FLT3 inhibition efficiently abrogated proliferation of MLL-AF9-induced Hes1-null AML cells. Furthermore, an agonistic anti-Notch2 antibody induced apoptosis of MLL-AF9-induced AML cells in a Hes1-wild type but not a Hes1-null background. We also accessed two independent databases containing messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles and found that the expression level of FLT3 mRNA was negatively correlated with those of HES1 in patient AML samples. These observations demonstrate that Hes1 mediates tumor suppressive roles of Notch signaling in AML development, probably by downregulating FLT3 expression.","['Kato, T', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, M',

Although proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have transformed management of multiple myeloma (MM), drug resistance emerges through induction of the aggresome+autophagy pathway as a compensatory protein clearance mechanism. Genome-wide profiling identified microRNAs (miRs) differentially expressed in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells compared with drug-naive cells. The effect of individual miRs on proteasomal degradation of short-lived fluorescent reporter proteins was then determined in live cells. MiR-29b was significantly reduced in bortezomib-resistant cells as well as in cells resistant to second-generation PIs carfilzomib and ixazomib. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-29b targeted PSME4 that encodes the proteasome activator PA200. Synthetically engineered miR-29b replacements impaired the growth of myeloma cells, patient tumor cells and xenotransplants. MiR-29b replacements also decreased PA200 association with proteasomes, reduced the proteasome's peptidase activity and inhibited ornithine decarboxylase turnover, a proteasome substrate degraded through ubiquitin-independent mechanisms. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that miR-29b replacements enhanced the bortezomib-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins but did not reveal aggresome or autophagosome formation. Taken together, our study identifies miR-29b replacements as the first-in-class miR-based PIs that also disrupt the autophagy pathway and highlight their potential to synergistically enhance the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib.","['Jagannathan, S', 'Vad, N', 'Vallabhapurapu, S', 'Vallabhapurapu, S', 'Anderson, K C', 'Driscoll, J J']","['Jagannathan S', 'Vad N', 'Vallabhapurapu S', 'Vallabhapurapu S', 'Anderson KC', 'Driscoll JJ']","['1] The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA [2] Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', '1] The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA [2] Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center and LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA [2] Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA [3] Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140919,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (proteasome activator 200 kDa, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics/metabolism', 'Phagosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2014/09/23 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/09/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014279 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.279 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):727-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.279.

Among its therapeutic properties, Chamomilla recutita has anti-inflammatory effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the dosage of the liquid extract of C recutita in mouthwash that is needed to reduce the incidence and intensity of oral mucositis in adult patients undergoing allogenic HSCT. METHODS: In a randomized phase II clinical trial, 40 patients were randomized to receive routine care plus mouthwash containing a liquid extract of C recutita at 0.5%, 1%, or 2% (experimental groups) or standard care alone (control group). Daily evaluation was performed using the measurement scale for oral toxicity defined by the World Health Organization. Statistical analysis was performed, in which the incidence, intensity, and duration of oral mucositis were compared between each experimental group and the control group. RESULTS: The experimental group at the 1% dosage demonstrated reduced incidence, intensity, and duration of oral mucositis compared with the control group. The formulation was well tolerated by patients and was safe, as no moderate or severe adverse effects were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of mouthwash containing 1% C recutita extract can be associated with reduced incidence, intensity, and duration of mucositis in adults patients undergoing allogenic HSCT. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this investigation will help nurses and other professionals in selecting the C recutita dosage used to manage oral mucositis in patients undergoing HSCT.","['Braga, Fernanda T M M', 'Santos, Ana C F', 'Bueno, Paula C P', 'Silveira, Renata C C P', 'Santos, Claudia B', 'Bastos, Jairo K', 'Carvalho, Emilia C']","['Braga FT', 'Santos AC', 'Bueno PC', 'Silveira RC', 'Santos CB', 'Bastos JK', 'Carvalho EC']","['Author Affiliations: Ribeirao Preto College of Nursing, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto (Drs Braga, Silveira, C.B.

AIM: To study the impact of p53, p21, and mdm2 gene polymorphisms on the clinical outcome in adult AML patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Cairo University. METHODS: Forty-eight adult AML patients presented to the Medical Oncology Department, NCI, from April 2010 till November 2011. Clinical data and bone marrow samples were obtained. Molecular genetic analysis involving P53, MDM2, and P21 single-nucleotide gene polymorphisms was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism coupled analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 35.7 years. After a median follow-up period of 12 months, 28 patients (58.4%) achieved complete remission (CR) and the overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months. Patients with homozygous Arg/arg at codon 72 of P53 had a better median OS months than Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro (13.4 vs. 8.4 vs. 1.5 months, respectively; P = 0.045). P53/p21 combination had a better median OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of 12.1 and 13.7 months for wild type cases (GG + Ser/ser) and 20.3 and 20.7 months for patients with either variant genes (GC + Ser/arg) compared with 1.1 and 1.9 months for patients with both variant genes (CC + arg/arg), (P = 0.037 and 0.004). The presence of wild genotype of either P21 or MDM2 may abolish the effect of P53 homozygous variant genotype on the OS. Neither p21nor mdm2 polymorphism alone showed an impact on OS or DFS. CR was not affected by any of the three gene polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The p53 pathway gene polymorphisms may affect the OS of adult AML patients.","['Abdel Hamid, Thoraya M', 'El Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Eibead, Gamal T', 'Saber, Mostafa M', 'Abol Elazm, Omnia M']","['Abdel Hamid TM', 'El Gammal MM', 'Eibead GT', 'Saber MM', 'Abol Elazm OM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140918,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Clinical outcome', 'Polymorphism', 'mdm2', 'p21', 'p53 gene']",2014/09/19 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000200 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Jul;20(6):328-35. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000200.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of COS on embryo implantation and the role of aquaporin 2 (AQP2). We recruited eight patients who underwent COS and 40 matched controls. Endometrial samples were collected on Day 4~8 after injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin in the COS group and in the mid-secretory phase in the control group. Human endometrial morphological changes after COS were examined and expression of AQP2, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrin B3 (ITGB3) were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry in human endometrium and Ishikawa cells. Attachment rates were obtained using the embryo attachment test. The results showed that endometrial epithelial cells from the COS group were disrupted and lacked pinopodes. Messenger RNA and protein levels of AQP2, LIF and ITGB3 decreased in endometrial samples from the COS group. Knockdown of AQP2 resulted in reduced expression of LIF and ITGB3 and reduced embryo attachment rates. In conclusion, impaired endometrial receptivity in patients who underwent COS is correlated with a decreased expression of AQP2.","['Zhang, Dan', 'Xu, Gufeng', 'Zhang, Runju', 'Zhu, Yimin', 'Gao, Huijuan', 'Zhou, Caiyun', 'Sheng, Jianzhong', 'Huang, Hefeng']","['Zhang D', 'Xu G', 'Zhang R', 'Zhu Y', 'Gao H', 'Zhou C', 'Sheng J', 'Huang H']","[""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China."", ""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China."", ""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China."", ""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China."", ""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China."", 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 866# Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics, Ministry of Education of China, Zhejiang University, 866# Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou, 310058, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (AQP2 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporin 2)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TGFB3 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aquaporin 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/*adverse effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', '*Embryo Implantation, Delayed', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ovulation Induction/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta3/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/09/19 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['RD13397 [pii]', '10.1071/RD13397 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2016 Mar;28(4):499-506. doi: 10.1071/RD13397.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early stage diagnosis can have a positive effect on prognoses and the quality of life of children with cancer. We investigated delays in the diagnosis of childhood cancers in Egypt and determined the factors associated with these delays. METHODS: This retrospective study included 172 children with cancer from two pediatric oncology units. The interval between symptoms onset and final diagnosis for each child was estimated and examined by univariate and multivariate analyses to determine correlations with the child's sex, age at diagnosis, type and site of malignancy, family residence, socioeconomic status, and parental educational level. FINDINGS: The median total diagnosis delay period was 47 days caused by patients and/or parents (8 days) and diagnosis (28 days). Statistically significant patient factors associated with delayed diagnosis were age (<5 years), lower parental education, and socioeconomic status. Sex residence and family size were not significant. Malignancy type and tumor site significantly affected the time for diagnosis. The lowest median value was associated with germ cell tumors (GCTs) and leukemia, and the highest value was in children with brain tumor. Missed diagnoses were initially recorded in 39.5% of the patients and were associated with patient and tumor factors.

The highly polymorphic HLA genes of the major histocompatibility complex play a central role in immune surveillance and confer risk for autoimmune and infectious diseases and several different cancers, the role for which in the development of CLL has not been extensively investigated. The National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match has collected HLA typing from CLL patients in need of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and has recruited millions of volunteers to potentially donate hematopoietic stem cells. HLA genotypes for 3491 US white, 397 African-American, and 90 Hispanic CLL patients were compared with 50 000 controls per population from the donor registry. We identified several HLA alleles associated with CLL susceptibility in each population, reconfirming predisposing roles of HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-DRB4*01:01 in whites. Associations for haplotype DRB4*01:01 approximately DRB1*07:01 approximately DQB1*03:03 were replicated across all 3 populations.

We have engineered the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) mAb, HuM195, targeting the leukemic antigen CD33, by introducing the triple mutation Ser293Asp/Ala330Leu/Ile332Glu (DLE), and developed Time-lapse Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids to analyze antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity kinetics of thousands of individual natural killer (NK) cells and mAb-coated target cells. We demonstrate that the DLE-HuM195 antibody increases both the quality and the quantity of NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity by endowing more NK cells to participate in cytotoxicity via accrued CD16-mediated signaling and by increasing serial killing of target cells. NK cells encountering targets coated with DLE-HuM195 induce rapid target cell apoptosis by promoting simultaneous conjugates to multiple target cells and induce apoptosis in twice the number of target cells within the same period as the wild-type mAb. Enhanced target killing was also associated with increased frequency of NK cells undergoing apoptosis, but this effect was donor-dependent. Antibody-based therapies targeting tumor antigens will benefit from a better understanding of cell-mediated tumor elimination, and our work opens further opportunities for the therapeutic targeting of CD33 in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Romain, Gabrielle', 'Senyukov, Vladimir', 'Rey-Villamizar, Nicolas', 'Merouane, Amine', 'Kelton, William', 'Liadi, Ivan', 'Mahendra, Ankit', 'Charab, Wissam', 'Georgiou, George', 'Roysam, Badrinath', 'Lee, Dean A', 'Varadarajan, Navin']","['Romain G', 'Senyukov V', 'Rey-Villamizar N', 'Merouane A', 'Kelton W', 'Liadi I', 'Mahendra A', 'Charab W', 'Georgiou G', 'Roysam B', 'Lee DA', 'Varadarajan N']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX;', 'Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Texas, Austin, TX.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Texas, Austin, TX.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Texas, Austin, TX.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Engineering', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Time-Lapse Imaging']",,,2014/09/19 06:00,2015/02/25 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35384-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-569061 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 20;124(22):3241-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-569061.

In normal karyotype AML, the presence of a FLT3/ITD mutation is associated with poor prognosis, as mirrored by a high risk of relapse even after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The poor prognostic impact along with the observation that FLT3 is frequently overexpressed in the majority of AML cases has formed the platform for the development of FLT3-targeted strategies. To date, several FLT3 kinase inhibitors have been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. However, as of yet, none of the studied FLT3 inhibitors has received FDA approval for routine clinical use in AML. This is in part due to the 'off target' effects observed with most inhibitors when administered at concentrations needed to achieve sustained levels of FLT3 inhibition, which are required to exhibit substantial cytotoxic effects against leukemic blasts. Furthermore, the development of resistance mutations has emerged as a clinical issue posing a threat to successful FLT3 inhibitor therapy. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors provide a brief summary of FLT3 inhibitors investigated thus far, and discuss current treatment approaches and strategies how to best incorporate FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into therapy. EXPERT OPINION: The combination of a FLT3 inhibitor with conventional chemotherapeutic regimens, epigenetic modifiers or inhibitors of FLT3 downstream and collateral effectors has emerged as a promising strategy to improve treatment outcome. The future of a tailored, molecular-based treatment approach for FLT3-mutated AML demands novel clinical trial concepts based on harmonized and aligned research goals between clinical and research centers and industry.","['Konig, Heiko', 'Levis, Mark']","['Konig H', 'Levis M']","['Johns Hopkins University, Medical Oncology , 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140918,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3/internal tandem duplications mutation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'hypomethylation']",2014/09/19 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2014.960843 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2015 Jan;19(1):37-54. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2014.960843.

We have previously shown that the E3 ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) is an important regulator of PML protein stability but the relationship and clinical impact of PML and E6AP expression in prostatic carcinoma is unknown. METHODS: E6AP and PML expression was assessed in tissue microarrays from a phase I discovery cohort of 170 patients treated by radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer (PC). Correlation analysis was carried out between PML and E6AP expression and clinicopathological variates including PSA as a surrogate of disease recurrence. The results were confirmed in a phase II validation cohort of 318 patients with associated clinical recurrence and survival data. RESULTS: Survival analysis of the phase I cohort revealed that patients whose tumors showed reduced PML and high E6AP expression had reduced time to PSA relapse (P = 0.012). This was confirmed in the phase II validation cohort where the expression profile of high E6AP/low PML was significantly associated with reduced time to PSA relapse (P < 0.001), clinical relapse (P = 0.016) and PC-specific death (P = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, this expression profile was an independent prognostic indicator of PSA relapse and clinical relapse independent of clinicopathologic factors predicting recurrence. CONCLUSION: This study identifies E6AP and PML as potential prognostic markers in localized prostate carcinoma and supports a role for E6AP in driving the downregulation or loss of PML expression in prostate carcinomas.","['Birch, S E', 'Kench, J G', 'Takano, E', 'Chan, P', 'Chan, A-L', 'Chiam, K', 'Veillard, A-S', 'Stricker, P', 'Haupt, S', 'Haupt, Y', 'Horvath, L', 'Fox, S B']","['Birch SE', 'Kench JG', 'Takano E', 'Chan P', 'Chan AL', 'Chiam K', 'Veillard AS', 'Stricker P', 'Haupt S', 'Haupt Y', 'Horvath L', 'Fox SB']","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer, East Melbourne.

However, TBI causes profound short-term and long-term side effects, provoking the necessity for alternative regimens. Treosulfan combines a potent immunosuppressive and antileukaemic effect with myeloablative activity and low toxicity profile. We retrospectively studied toxicity and outcome of 71 paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following treosulfan-based conditioning aiming to identify risk factors for treatment failure and dose-depending outcome differences. Early regimen-related toxicity was low. No case of veno-occlusive disease was reported. There was no association of toxicity with age or number of HSCT. Event-free survival (EFS) of infants was significantly better compared to older children.

MM remains incurable even with high dose chemotherapy using conventional drugs, thus necessitating development of novel therapeutic strategies. Gossypol (Gos) is a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from cotton plants, and has been shown to possess anti-neoplastic activity against various tumors. Recent studies have shown that Gos is an inhibitor for Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL acting as BH3 mimetics that interfere interaction between pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL. Since most of the patients with MM overexpress Bcl-2 protein, we considered Gos might be a promising therapeutic agent for MM. We herein show that Gos efficiently induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of the OPM2 MM cell line, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Gos induced activation of caspase-3 and cytochrome c release from mitochondria, showing mitochondrial dysfunction pathway is operational during apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at serine-70 was attenuated by Gos treatment, while protein levels were not affected. In addition, Mcl-1 was downregulated by Gos. Interestingly, phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, ERK1/2 and p38MAPK was inhibited by Gos-treatment, indicating that Gos globally suppressed interleukin-6 (IL-6) signals. Moreover, JAK2 inhibition mimicked the effect of Gos in OPM2 cells including Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation. These results demonstrated that Gos induces apoptosis in MM cells not only through displacing BH3-only proteins from Bcl-2, but also through inhibiting IL-6 signaling, which leads to Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation.","['Sadahira, Ken', 'Sagawa, Morihiko', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Uchida, Hideo', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Sadahira K', 'Sagawa M', 'Nakazato T', 'Uchida H', 'Ikeda Y', 'Okamoto S', 'Nakajima H', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama 350-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Municipal Hospital, Kanagawa 240-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Electric Power Company Hospital, Tokyo 160-0016, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama 350-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140915,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gossypol', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2014/09/19 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2652 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Dec;45(6):2278-86. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2652.

We previously demonstrated that a CD4-dependent mechanism is responsible for the long-term protection of CD20(+) tumor-bearing mice by anti-CD20 treatment. Here, we compare tumor immunity in tumor-bearing animals that did or did not receive anti-CD20 treatment. Splenic CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) expanded substantially in untreated mice that exhibited then a reduced survival, whereas Tregs depletion led to long-term survival of the animals, suggesting the establishment of a Treg-dependent immunosuppressive environment after tumor injection. Strikingly, anti-CD20 therapy reversed the initial expansion of Tregs, and was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of Th1 cells, with no detectable change in Th2 and Th17 cell numbers. Interleukin-12 serum level was also increased by the anti-CD20 treatment, and activated myeloid dendritic cells producing interleukin-12 could be detected in lymph nodes of treated animals, while interferon-gamma blockade strongly reduced survival. Also, CD4(+) effector memory T cells were evidenced in surviving animals, and the transfer of CD4(+) T cells induced long-term protection. Thus, anti-CD20 therapy promotes strong anti-tumor adaptive immunity, opposes Treg expansion and inhibits tumor cells from maintaining an immunosuppressive environment.","['Deligne, C', 'Metidji, A', 'Fridman, W-H', 'Teillaud, J-L']","['Deligne C', 'Metidji A', 'Fridman WH', 'Teillaud JL']","['1] Cordeliers Research Center-INSERM UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [2] Paris Descartes-Paris 5 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [3] Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France.', '1] Cordeliers Research Center-INSERM UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [2] Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France.', '1] Cordeliers Research Center-INSERM UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [2] Paris Descartes-Paris 5 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [3] Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France.', '1] Cordeliers Research Center-INSERM UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [2] Paris Descartes-Paris 5 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France [3] Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 University, UMR-S 1138, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140918,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rituximab', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Th17 Cells/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/immunology/pathology']",,,2014/09/19 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014275 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.275 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Apr;29(4):947-57. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.275.

In this study, we used an unbiased MYB 3'untranslated region-microRNA (miRNA) library screen and identified 33 putative MYB-targeting miRNAs. Subsequently, transcriptome data from two independent T-ALL cohorts and different subsets of normal T-cells were used to select miRNAs with relevance in the context of normal and malignant T-cell transformation.

The clinical presentation appears to be similar to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the myocardial dysfunction is reversible. CASE REPORT: We report on the case of a 58-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted to our hospital to receive the second course of consolidation chemotherapy with intravenous cytarabine. Subsequently, the patient developed severe dyspnea at rest, with cardiogenic shock after the central venous catheter was removed. Echocardiography revealed severe dyskinesia of the mid and apical portions of both ventricles, accompanied by a highly reduced left ventricular function (LVF). 5 months later, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) did not show any evidence of repolar-ization disorders and echocardiographic evaluation revealed a normal LVF. We suppose that the underlying mechanism was TC. CONCLUSIONS: TC can occur in patients with AML under systemic chemotherapy, which possibly represents a triggering factor for TC development. Cardiogenic shock is a serious life-threatening complication of TC. Nevertheless, the prognosis of TC is favorable and a complete recovery of the LVF is possible.","['Baumann, Stefan', 'Huseynov, Aydin', 'Goranova, Diana', 'Faust, Melanie', 'Behnes, Michael', 'Nolte, Florian', 'Heidenreich, Daniela', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Borggrefe, Martin', 'Akin, Ibrahim', 'Klein, Stefan']","['Baumann S', 'Huseynov A', 'Goranova D', 'Faust M', 'Behnes M', 'Nolte F', 'Heidenreich D', 'Hofmann WK', 'Borggrefe M', 'Akin I', 'Klein S']","['First Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140711,Netherlands,Oncol Res Treat,Oncology research and treatment,101627692,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/19 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000365536 [pii]', '10.1159/000365536 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Res Treat. 2014;37(9):487-90. doi: 10.1159/000365536.

In summary, children with DS and AML should be treated with a moderate-intensity cytarabine-based regimen with curative intent.","['Caldwell, J Timothy', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Caldwell JT', 'Ge Y', 'Taub JW']","['MD/PhD Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 110 East Warren Ave, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140918,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Down syndrome', 'GATA1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'prognosis', 'treatment']",2014/09/19 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/09/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.959923 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Dec;7(6):831-40. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.959923.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles were generated from 709 neuroblastoma specimens using customized 4 x 44 K microarrays. Classification models were built using 75 tumors with contrasting courses of disease. Validation was performed in an independent test set (n = 634) by Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The best-performing classifier predicted patient outcome with an accuracy of 0.95 (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.97) in the validation cohort. The highest potential clinical value of this predictor was observed for current low-risk patients [5-year event-free survival (EFS), 0.84 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.10; 5-year overall survival (OS), 0.99 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.11; both P < 0.001] and intermediate-risk patients (5-year EFS, 0.88 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.10; 5-year OS, 1.0 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.09; both P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox regression models for low-risk/intermediate-risk patients, the classifier outperformed risk assessment of the current German trial NB2004 [EFS: hazard ratio (HR), 5.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.20-8.02; OS: HR, 25.54; 95% CI, 8.40-77.66; both P < 0.001]. On the basis of these findings, we propose to integrate the classifier into a revised risk stratification system for low-risk/intermediate-risk patients. According to this system, we identified novel subgroups with poor outcome (5-year EFS, 0.19 +/- 0.08; 5-year OS, 0.59 +/- 0.1), for whom we propose intensified treatment, and with beneficial outcome (5-year EFS, 0.87 +/- 0.05; 5-year OS, 1.0), who may benefit from treatment de-escalation. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of gene expression-based classification and established prognostic markers improves risk estimation of patients with low-risk/intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. We propose to implement our revised treatment stratification system in a prospective clinical trial.","['Oberthuer, Andre', 'Juraeva, Dilafruz', 'Hero, Barbara', 'Volland, Ruth', 'Sterz, Carolina', 'Schmidt, Rene', 'Faldum, Andreas', 'Kahlert, Yvonne', 'Engesser, Anne', 'Asgharzadeh, Shahab', 'Seeger, Robert', 'Ohira, Miki', 'Nakagawara, Akira', 'Scaruffi, Paola', 'Tonini, Gian Paolo', 'Janoueix-Lerosey, Isabelle', 'Delattre, Olivier', 'Schleiermacher, Gudrun', 'Vandesompele, Jo', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Noguera, Rosa', 'Piqueras, Marta', 'Benard, Jean', 'Valent, Alexander', 'Avigad, Smadar', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Grundy, Richard G', 'Ortmann, Monika', 'Shao, Chunxuan', 'Schwab, Manfred', 'Eils, Roland', 'Simon, Thorsten', 'Theissen, Jessica', 'Berthold, Frank', 'Westermann, Frank', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Fischer, Matthias']","['Oberthuer A', 'Juraeva D', 'Hero B', 'Volland R', 'Sterz C', 'Schmidt R', 'Faldum A', 'Kahlert Y', 'Engesser A', 'Asgharzadeh S', 'Seeger R', 'Ohira M', 'Nakagawara A', 'Scaruffi P', 'Tonini GP', 'Janoueix-Lerosey I', 'Delattre O', 'Schleiermacher G', 'Vandesompele J', 'Speleman F', 'Noguera R', 'Piqueras M', 'Benard J', 'Valent A', 'Avigad S', 'Yaniv I', 'Grundy RG', 'Ortmann M', 'Shao C', 'Schwab M', 'Eils R', 'Simon T', 'Theissen J', 'Berthold F', 'Westermann F', 'Brors B', 'Fischer M']","[""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", 'Department of Theoretical Bioinformatics (B080), German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Laboratory of Cancer Genomics, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuoh-ku, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry and Innovative Cancer Therapeutics, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuoh-ku, Chiba, Japan.', 'Center of Physiopathology of Human Reproduction, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, IRCCS San Martino Hospital, National Cancer Research Institute (IST), Genoa, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Neuroblastoma, Onco/Hematology Laboratory Department SDB University of Padua, Pediatric Research Institute, Padua, Italy.', 'Institut Curie, INSERM Unit 830, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, INSERM Unit 830, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, INSERM Unit 830, Paris, France.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Tumor Genetics, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Tumor Genetics, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', ""Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Petah Tikva, Israel.

Sustained hematopoiesis after double UCBT usually is derived from a single donor unit, as only a few patients have been reported to display stable mixed-unit chimerism for varying periods of time. Explanations for the 1 unit dominance, predictors for identifying unit superiority, and persistence of long-term mixed-unit chimerism remain elusive. Review of published literature revealed only 11 of 280 patients (4%) with mixed-unit chimerism for at least 1 year after transplantation, with 3 patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Mixed-unit chimerism was more likely if both units were closely HLA matched to each other. Outcome data for patients with stable mixed-unit chimerism, for the most part, were scarcely reported. Analysis of the small sample size revealed a potential advantage of stable mixed-unit chimerism on enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effect; however, definitive conclusions cannot be made on the effect of mixed-unit chimerism on the rates of graft-versus-host disease. Therefore, gathering outcome data prospectively in larger clinical series will help answer the question of whether stable mixed-unit chimerism is either beneficial and, therefore, should be strived for, detrimental and, thus, needs to be eliminated, or if it is of no clinical consequence.","['Hashem, Hasan', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Hashem H', 'Lazarus HM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.

In conclusion, both quassinoids present differential toxicity towards leukemia cells, and the presence of the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone in eurycomanone could be prerequisite for the NF-kappaB inhibition.","['Hajjouli, Sheherazade', 'Chateauvieux, Sebastien', 'Teiten, Marie-Helene', 'Orlikova, Barbora', 'Schumacher, Marc', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Choo, Chee-Yan', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Hajjouli S', 'Chateauvieux S', 'Teiten MH', 'Orlikova B', 'Schumacher M', 'Dicato M', 'Choo CY', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer (LBMCC), Hopital Kirchberg, 9, Rue Edward Steichen, Luxembourg L-2540, Luxembourg. sheherazade.hajjouli@lbmcc.lu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Building 20 Room 303, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea. s.chateauvieux@snu.ac.kr.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer (LBMCC), Hopital Kirchberg, 9, Rue Edward Steichen, Luxembourg L-2540, Luxembourg. marie_helene.teiten@lbmcc.lu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Building 20 Room 303, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea. barboraorlikova@snu.ac.kr.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer (LBMCC), Hopital Kirchberg, 9, Rue Edward Steichen, Luxembourg L-2540, Luxembourg. marc.schumacher@lbmcc.lu.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer (LBMCC), Hopital Kirchberg, 9, Rue Edward Steichen, Luxembourg L-2540, Luxembourg. mdicato@gmail.com.', 'MedChem Herbal Research Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Puncak Alam, Selangor 42300, Malaysia. choo715@puncakalam.uitm.edu.my.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Building 20 Room 303, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea. marcdiederich@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140916,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Quassins)', '0 (eurycomanone)', '84633-28-3 (eurycomanol)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Eurycoma/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Quassins/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules190914649 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules190914649 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2014 Sep 16;19(9):14649-66. doi: 10.3390/molecules190914649.,,,PMC6270735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A PVL model of 3-day-old Wistar rats was prepared by left carotid artery ligation followed by 6% oxygen for 4 hours. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days of hypoxia ischemia (HI), and the brain tissues were sampled. Real-Time PCR and Western blot methods were applied to analyze the expression of LIF mRNA and protein. Double staining immunofluorescence was used to detect the co-expression of LIF and GFAP. RESULTS: At 1, 3 and 7 days of HI, LIF protein level in the PVL group was higher than in the control group (P<0.01). In the PVL group, the LIF protein level on the third day after HI reached a peak and was higher than the other time points (P<0.01). The change of LIF mRNA expression showed the same tendency with LIF protein. The double staining immunofluorescence showed a co-expression of LIF and GFAP. CONCLUSIONS: LIF mRNA and LIF protein expression in astrocytes show a trend of initial increase followed by steady decline in neonatal rats with PVL, suggesting that endogenous LIF may participate in the repair of PVL.","['Fan, Yu-Ying', 'Yu, Tao', 'Zhang, Jun-Mei', 'Wang, Hua', 'Zhao, Gui-Feng', 'Liu, Bo']","['Fan YY', 'Yu T', 'Zhang JM', 'Wang H', 'Zhao GF', 'Liu B']","['Department of Pediatric Neurology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, China. wangh1@sj-hospital.org.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukomalacia, Periventricular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2014.09.014 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2014 Sep;16(9):933-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY: This was an interventional study with 80 parents of children with leukemia; all of the caregivers were mothers and were included in the research. They were chosen using the convenience sampling method and categorized randomly into two groups (intervention and control, each with 40 participants). Research tools included demographic information and Quality of Life (QoL) scale (a specific form for first-degree family caregivers of patients with leukemia). Questionnaires were applied at the beginning of the research and after three months; this second evaluation coincided in the study group with the end of the intervention. The intervention lasted four sessions of 45- to 65-minute classes, with lectures and question and answer sessions, educational booklets, and posters in groups with 4 - 6 members. RESULTS: In the first evaluation, mean QoL scores in the study and control groups were 224.9 and 225.7, which, after three months changed to 338.2 and 226.7, respectively. T-test verified these increases (p<0.05) in quality of life in the intervention group.

We have investigated the anticarcinogenic effect of phloridzin and its novel derivatives using human cancer cell lines. We have synthesised novel acylated derivatives of phloridzin with six different long chain fatty acids by regioselective enzymatic acylation using Candida Antarctica lipase B. The antiproliferative effects of the new compounds were investigated in comparison with the parent compounds, phloridzin, aglycone phloretin, the six free fatty acids and chemotherapeutic drugs (sorafenib, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells and acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells along with normal human and rat hepatocytes. The fatty acid esters of phloridzin inhibited significantly the growth of the two carcinoma and leukemia cells while similar treatment doses were not toxic to normal human or rat hepatocytes. The antiproliferative potency of fatty esters of phloridzin was comparable to the potency of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The fatty acid esters of phloridzin inhibited DNA topoisomerases IIalpha activity that might induce G0/G1 phase arrest, induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3, and decreased ATP level and mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 cells. Based on the high selectivity on cancer cells, decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ester of phloridzin was selected for gene expression analysis using RT2PCR human cancer drug target array. Antiproliferative effect of DHA ester of phloridzin could be related to the down regulation of anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2), growth factor receptors (EBFR family, IGF1R/IGF2, PDGFR) and its downstream signalling partners (PI3k/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MAPK), cell cycle machinery (CDKs, TERT, TOP2A, TOP2B) as well as epigenetics regulators (HDACs). These results suggest that fatty esters of phloridzin have potential chemotherapeutic effects mediated through the attenuated expression of several key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA topoisomerases IIalpha activity and epigenetic mechanisms followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","['Nair, Sandhya V G', 'Ziaullah', 'Rupasinghe, H P Vasantha']","['Nair SV', 'Ziaullah', 'Rupasinghe HP']","['Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie University, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie University, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie University, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140917,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CU9S17279X (Phlorhizin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (Top2a protein, rat)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Phlorhizin/*pharmacology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Rats']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107149 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-12808 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 17;9(9):e107149. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107149. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4167698,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The B cell receptor (BCR) normally providing tonic signals for cell survival and mitogenic responses to antigens, can also contribute to lymphomagenesis upon sustained ligand binding or activating mutations. BCR signaling varies among cell compartments and BCR classes. For unknown reasons, some malignancies associate with expression of either IgM or class-switched Ig. We explored whether an IgA BCR, with strong tonic signaling, would affect lymphomagenesis in c-myc IgH 3'RR transgenic mice prone to lymphoproliferations. Breeding c-myc transgenics in a background where IgM expression was replaced with IgA delayed lymphomagenesis. By comparison to single c-myc transgenics, lymphomas from double mutant animals were more differentiated and less aggressive, with an altered transcriptional program. Larger tumor cells more often expressed CD43 and CD138, which culminated in a plasma cell phenotype in 10% of cases. BCR class-specific signals thus appear to modulate lymphomagenesis and may partly explain the observed association of specific Ig classes with human B cell malignancies of differential phenotype, progression and prognosis.","['Amin, Rada', 'Marfak, Abdelghafour', 'Pangault, Celine', 'Oblet, Christelle', 'Chanut, Aurelie', 'Tarte, Karin', 'Denizot, Yves', 'Cogne, Michel']","['Amin R', 'Marfak A', 'Pangault C', 'Oblet C', 'Chanut A', 'Tarte K', 'Denizot Y', 'Cogne M']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Limoges, France.

However, recent evidence suggests that mature miRNAs are more 'dynamic' and that each miRNA precursor arm gives rise to multiple isoforms, the isomiRs. Here we report on our identification of numerous and abundant isomiRs in the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 452 men and women from five different population groups. Unexpectedly, we find that these isomiRs exhibit an expression profile that is population-dependent and gender-dependent. This is important as it indicates that the LCLs of each gender/population combination have their own unique collection of mature miRNA transcripts. Moreover, each identified isomiR has its own characteristic abundance that remains consistent across biological replicates indicating that these are not degradation products. The primary sequences of identified isomiRs differ from the known miRBase miRNA either at their 5 -endpoint (leads to a different 'seed' sequence and suggests a different targetome), their 3 -endpoint, or both simultaneously. Our analysis of Argonaute PAR-CLIP data from LCLs supports the association of many of these newly identified isomiRs with the Argonaute silencing complex and thus their functional roles through participation in the RNA interference pathway.","['Loher, Phillipe', 'Londin, Eric R', 'Rigoutsos, Isidore']","['Loher P', 'Londin ER', 'Rigoutsos I']","['Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA Precursors)']",IM,"['African Americans/*genetics', 'Argonaute Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Europe/ethnology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nigeria/ethnology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sex Factors', 'Utah/epidemiology', 'Whites/*genetics']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['2405 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2405 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Sep 30;5(18):8790-802. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2405.,,,PMC4226722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently the transcription factor SOX11 has been discovered to be expressed in most MCL, including cyclin D1-negative cases. In this study we assess the performance of 2 commercially available monoclonal antibodies, Atlas Antibodies (Stockholm, Sweden) clone CLO142 and Cell Marque (Rocklin, CA) clone MRQ-58, for SOX11 immunohistochemistry in MCL, both cyclin D1 positive and cyclin D1 negative, as well as in cases of other small B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), Burkitt lymphomas, and lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas. We also performed Western blots to further characterize the antibody specificity. Both antibodies show reliable, clear nuclear staining in MCL with variable specificity. However, the MRQ-58 antibody was more specific for MCL than CLO142, which showed considerably more nonspecific staining, especially in DLBCLs (59% positive vs. 4% positive with MRQ-58). In addition we reconfirmed the utility of SOX11 IHC for identifying cases of cyclin D1-negative blastoid MCL.

Although SOX11 IHC is a powerful, and relatively accessible, tool to identify MCLs with variant immunophenotypes and/or morphology, these latter 2 cases highlight the need for strict criteria for interpreting SOX11 staining.","['Nakashima, Megan O', 'Durkin, Lisa', 'Bodo, Juraj', 'Lin, Jeffrey', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Fu, Kai', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Nakashima MO', 'Durkin L', 'Bodo J', 'Lin J', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Fu K', 'Hsi ED']","['*Department of Clinical Pathology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH daggerInstitute of Pathology, Eberhard-Karls-University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany double daggerDepartment of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical, Center, Omaha, NE.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000067 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2014 Nov-Dec;22(10):720-7. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000067.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, loss of FPGS expression and/or function results in lack of antifolate polyglutamylation and drug resistance. Members of the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway are negative regulators of hematopoiesis and deregulation of this pathway is considered a major contributor to leukemogenesis. Here we show that FPGS gene expression is inversely correlated with the binding of a Smad4/Ets-1 complex to exon12 of FPGS in both acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and acute myeloid leukemia blast specimens. We demonstrate that antifolate resistant leukemia cells harbor a heterozygous point mutation in exon12 of FPGS which disrupts FPGS activity by abolishing ATP binding, and alters the binding pattern of transcription factors to the genomic region of exon12. This in turn results in the near complete silencing of the wild type allele leading to a 97% loss of FPGS activity. We show that exon12 is a novel intragenic transcriptional regulator, endowed with the ability to drive transcription in vitro, and is occupied by transcription factors and chromatin remodeling agents (e.g. Smad4/Ets-1, HP-1 and Brg1) in vivo. These findings bear important implications for the rational overcoming of antifolate resistance in leukemia.","['Raz, Shachar', 'Stark, Michal', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Raz S', 'Stark M', 'Assaraf YG']","['The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (SMAD4 protein, human)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Smad4 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['2399 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2399 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Oct 15;5(19):9183-98. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2399.,,,PMC4253427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV causes a lymphoproliferative malignancy of CD4-activated cells called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a chronic myelopathy called tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). This study aims to determine the prevalence of HTLV among patients with lymphoid malignancies at a tertiary center in Lagos. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at the hematology clinic of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. After obtaining consent, approximately 5 mL of venous blood was collected from each subject. The serum was separated and stored at -20 degrees C. Sera were assayed for HTLV by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for the determination of antibodies to HTLV-1 and -2. Western blot confirmatory testing was done on reactive samples. All patients were also screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) by rapid kits. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with lymphoid malignancies were enrolled, consisting of 24 (61.5%) with solid malignancies, while 15 (38.5%) had leukemia. Only two patients (5.1%) with lymphoid malignancies were reactive on the ELISA test. On confirmatory testing with Western blot, two patients (5.1%) with lymphoid malignancies were also positive for HTLV. All patients were HIV negative, but four were positive to HBsAg and HCV. There was no association between history of previous blood transfusion and positivity to HTLV (P=0.544). CONCLUSION: A prevalence of 5.1% of HTLV among patients with lymphoid malignancies was found in this study, and previous history of blood transfusion was not found to be a significant cause of HTLV infection.","['Akinbami, Akinsegun', 'Durojaiye, Idris', 'Dosunmu, Adedoyin', 'John-Olabode, Sarah', 'Adediran, Adewumi', 'Oshinaike, Olajumoke', 'Uche, Ebele', 'Dada, Akinola', 'Odesanya, Mojeed', 'Okunoye, Olaitan']","['Akinbami A', 'Durojaiye I', 'Dosunmu A', 'John-Olabode S', 'Adediran A', 'Oshinaike O', 'Uche E', 'Dada A', 'Odesanya M', 'Okunoye O']","['Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, College of Medicine, Lagos State University, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, College of Medicine, Lagos State University, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology and Immunology, Ben Carson School of Medicine, Babcock University, Ilisan-Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Lagos State University, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, College of Medicine, Lagos State University, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Lagos State University, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Oak Hospitals, Ikorodu, Nigeria;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Port Harcourt, Rivers, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140905,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'ELISA', 'HTLV', 'TSP/HAM', 'lymphoid malignancies']",2014/09/18 06:00,2014/09/18 06:01,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S67912 [doi]', 'jbm-5-169 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2014 Sep 5;5:169-74. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S67912. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4161527,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research in this field most often focuses on the youngest and oldest patient age groups. However, the population of patients in between those age groups has received relatively little attention with few studies specifically focusing on them. This important 'age gap' has demonstrated a unique, difficult-to-treat group of patients known as adolescents and young adults, or AYAs. Variably defined in the literature as patients from late teenage years to the age of up to 40 years, the AYA group of patients represents a vulnerable subset of patients now identified to require its own focus, development of therapeutic strategies and parallel emphasis on special support systems involving multidisciplinary psychosocial care. Despite the great advancements that have been realized for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the AYA group has seldom been the focus of specific reports and studies, and the outcome appears to lag behind the general population. This review focuses on this subset of AYA patients with CML and summarizes the available data and recent developments, challenges and treatment options for this group of patients.","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Tex., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20140910,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['000363434 [pii]', '10.1159/000363434 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2014;132(3-4):298-306. doi: 10.1159/000363434.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which is usually diagnosed in a previously healthy kid, requiring immediate aggressive chemotherapy, brings difficulties and conflicts associated with severe illness to extremes. The incidence of AML in adolescents aged 15-19 years approaches 8.5 per million. Only in recent years has it become evident that the prognosis of AYAs diagnosed with AML is poorer compared to younger children diagnosed with AML with similar characteristics. No specific genetic aberration or other known poor risk factor was found to explain the inferior prognosis of AYAs. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia the contribution of differences between adult and pediatric protocols to AYA outcome is established. It has been suggested that pediatric protocols should also apply to AYAs with AML; however, data supporting this are vague. Herein, existing evidence regarding special considerations in treating AYAs with AML is discussed. Mental and psychological age-specific aspects important to consider when treating AYAs with AML are overviewed. Awareness for adolescent special needs, adherence to protocols and intensive supportive care are important. Multidisciplinary adolescent-oriented staff should be involved in the therapy of any AYA with AML escorting this special patient population on the road to cure.","['Ofran, Yishai', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Ofran Y', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140910,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/complications', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['000360200 [pii]', '10.1159/000360200 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2014;132(3-4):292-7. doi: 10.1159/000360200.

A major proportion of this cure rate drop occurs in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). The age range defining this population varies between studies, biological characteristics are different from both younger children and older adults, and AYAs are treated either by pediatric or adult oncologists, who often apply different treatment approaches to the same ALL patient population. The outcome of AYAs aged 15-21 years treated by more contemporary pediatric protocols is similar to that of younger children but is inferior when using adult regimens. This motivated studying AYA patients, including those above the age of 21 years, with pediatric or 'pediatrics-inspired' regimens that intensified nonmyelosuppressive drugs such as vincristine, steroids and asparaginase, with very promising preliminary results. Discovering new mutations in AYA ALL will help stratify patients into risk subgroups and identify targets for novel agents. This, together with fine-tuning pediatric chemotherapy principles will hopefully finally decrease the cure rate gap between children and AYAs - and even older adults.","['Burke, Patrick W', 'Douer, Dan']","['Burke PW', 'Douer D']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, N.Y., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140910,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['000360204 [pii]', '10.1159/000360204 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2014;132(3-4):264-73. doi: 10.1159/000360204.

METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques were used to assess 236 urban and rural cats from central and southern Portugal. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of haemoplasma in the target population was 27.1% (64/236), with individual species' prevalences as follows: 17.8% (42/236) 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (CMhm), 14.4% (34/236) Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf) and only 5.9% (14/236) 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' (CMt). Multiple infections were detected in 8.1% (19/236) of the samples, with triple and double infections with Mhf and CMhm being most commonly detected (5.9% [14/236] of cats). Haemoplasma infection was significantly higher in shelter cats (P = 0.015) than in cats with other lifestyles (eg, free-roaming/house pet/blood donors). Haemoplasma prevalence was also higher in cats with feline immunodeficiency virus infection (FIV; P = 0.011). Although sex was not significantly associated with haemoplasma infection (P = 0.050), CMt was predominantly found in males (P = 0.032). Also, the presence of haemoplasma multiple infections was statistically associated with being in a shelter (P = 0.021), male (P = 0.057) and with FIV co-infection (P = 0.004). No evidence of an association between haemoplasma infection and geographical location, age or feline leukaemia virus co-infection was found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results obtained in our study are consistent with the documented worldwide prevalence of feline haemoplasma infections, suggesting that the three main feline haemoplasma species are common in Portugal.","['Duarte, Ana', 'Marques, Vania', 'Correia, Jose Henrique Duarte', 'Neto, Isabel', 'Braz, Berta Sao', 'Rodrigues, Claudia', 'Martins, Telma', 'Rosado, Ricardo', 'Ferreira, Joaquim Pedro', 'Santos-Reis, Margarida', 'Tavares, Luis']","['Duarte A', 'Marques V', 'Correia JH', 'Neto I', 'Braz BS', 'Rodrigues C', 'Martins T', 'Rosado R', 'Ferreira JP', 'Santos-Reis M', 'Tavares L']","['Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health (CIISA), Foundation for Science and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal anaduarte@fmv.ulisboa.pt.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health (CIISA), Foundation for Science and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health (CIISA), Foundation for Science and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health (CIISA), Foundation for Science and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health (CIISA), Foundation for Science and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Vetoeiras Central Veterinary Hospital of Cascais Line, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Vetoeiras Central Veterinary Hospital of Cascais Line, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Department of Food Safety and Infection Biology Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for the Study of the Environment and the Sea, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Centre for Environmental Biology, Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health (CIISA), Foundation for Science and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140916,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,"['0 (RNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'Immunoblotting/veterinary', 'Male', 'Mycoplasma/*classification/*isolation & purification', 'Mycoplasma Infections/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Portugal/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Bacterial/classification', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1098612X14550172 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X14550172 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2015 Jun;17(6):516-22. doi: 10.1177/1098612X14550172.

FLC elevations in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are associated with an inferior survival. These increases in FLC can be monoclonal (as in myeloma) or polyclonal. The goal was to estimate the frequency of these elevations within distinct types of B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and whether the FLC measurements are associated with event-free survival (EFS). We studied serum for FLC abnormalities using normal laboratory reference ranges to define an elevated kappa or lambda FLC. Elevations were further classified as polyclonal or monoclonal. Four hundred ninety-two patients were studied: 453 B-cell and 34 T-cell NHL patients. Twenty-nine % (142/453) of patients had an elevated FLC of which 10% were monoclonal elevations. Within B-cell NHL, FLC abnormalities were most common in lymphoplasmacytic (79%), mantle cell (68%), and lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (31%); they were least common in follicular (15%). The hazard ratio (HR) for EFS in all patients was 1.41 (95% CI; 1.11-1.81); in all B-cell NHL the HR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.11-1.96); in all T-cell NHL the HR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.55-2.49). FLC abnormalities predicted an inferior OS (HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.93-3.90, P < 0.0001). The serum FLC assay is useful for prognosis in both B-cell and T-cell types of NHL.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of soluble CD44 (sCD44) and sCD44v6 in serum of children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and their relationship with prognosis. METHODS: sCD44v6 and sCD44 levels were measured in the sera of patients and healthy children by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The level of the molecules was analyzed in relation to laboratory and clinical characteristics of the patients at presentation and response to therapy. RESULT: sCD44v6 was significantly lower in patients (103.4 +/- 44 ng/mL) than in controls (173.5 +/- 73.6 ng/mL) whereas the serum level of sCD44 showed no significant difference between the groups. In patients, sCD44v6 quantity was inversely correlated with sCD44 level (r = -0.57, P < 0.01). The mean serum level of sCD44 in patients with >20% positivity for CD44 surface expression was greater than that in patients with </=20% positivity (1345 +/- 409 ng/mL vs 1111 +/- 390 ng/mL, P = 0.05). sCD44v6 showed no significant association with response to therapy and prognostic factors except the TEL/AML1 positivity, as it was higher in TEL/AML1 positive patients (157.3 +/- 55.6 ng/mL) than negative ones (92 +/- 43.6 ng/mL, P = 0.036). Conversely, sCD44 was lower in TEL/AML1 positive patients and showed a significant association with white blood cell number, blast percentage and extramedullary involvement. CONCLUSION: The lower level of sCD44v6 in patients than in controls suggests the possible diagnostic value of this molecule for B-ALL. The presence of an association with established prognostic factors despite of no relationship with disease outcome suggested these molecules for more studies in larger patient cohorts.","['Amirghofran, Zahra', 'Asiaee, Elham', 'Kamazani, Fatemeh M']","['Amirghofran Z', 'Asiaee E', 'Kamazani FM']","['Department of Immunology, Autoimmune Disease Research Center and Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Autoimmune Disease Research Center and Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140916,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*blood', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'prognosis', 'sCD44', 'sCD44v6']",2014/09/18 06:00,2017/01/20 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajco.12268 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep;12(3):e375-82. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12268.

It acts as a putative tumor suppressor by playing an important role in DNA damage responses, cell cycle control and apoptosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) appears to be an apoptosis related disorder and alteration in the NPAS2 gene might therefore be directly involved in the etiology of CLL. Here, the Ala394Thr polymorphism (rs2305160:G>A) in the NPAS2 gene was genotyped and melatonin concentrations were measured in a total of seventy-four individuals, including thirty-seven CLL cases and an equal number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls in order to examine the effect of NPAS2 polymorphism and melatonin concentrations on CLL risk in a Pakistani population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genotyping of rs2305160:G>A polymorphism at NPAS2 locus was carried out by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). Melatonin concentrations were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated no association of the variant Thr genotypes (Ala/ Thr and Thr/Thr) with risk of CLL. Similarly, no association of rs2305160 with CLL was observed in either females or males after stratification of study population on a gender basis. Moreover, when the subjects with CLL were further stratified into shift-workers and non-shift-workers, no association of rs2305160 with CLL was seen in either case. However, significantly low serum melatonin levels were observed in CLL patients as compared to healthy subjects (p<0.05). Also, lower melatonin levels were seen in shift-workers as compared to non-shift-workers (p<0.05). There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the melatonin levels across NPAS2 genotypes in all subjects, subjects with CLL who were either shift workers or non-shift-workers. General Linear Model (GLM) univariate analysis revealed no significant association (p>0.05) of the rs2305160 polymorphism of the NPAS2 gene with melatonin levels in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: While low melatonin levels and shift-work can be considered as one of the risk factors for CLL, the NPAS2 rs2305160 polymorphism does not appear to have any association with risk of CLL in our Pakistani population.","['Rana, Sobia', 'Shahid, Adeela', 'Ullah, Hafeez', 'Mahmood, Saqib']","['Rana S', 'Shahid A', 'Ullah H', 'Mahmood S']","['Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan E-mail : sqb_medgen@yahoo.com, medgen@uhs.edu.pk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (NPAS2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Asians/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Melatonin/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Pakistan', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm/*metabolism', 'Work Schedule Tolerance']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/06/06 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.17.7169 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(17):7169-74. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.17.7169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore present a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of bi CEBPA mutations in patients with AML. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken through August 2014 looking for eligible studies. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) in overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were used to calculate estimated effect. RESULTS: Ten studies covering a total of 6219 subjects were included in this analysis. Overall, bi CEBPA mutations were associated with favorable clinical outcome in patients with AML (HR for EFS: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.32-0.52; for OS: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.27-0.50), in cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML (HR for EFS: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.29-0.49; for OS: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.23-0.43). When took the cohort of monoallelic CEBPA (mo CEBPA) mutated and wild-type CEBPA (wt CEBPA) AML as a reference group, bi CEBPA mutated AML also shown beneficial outcomes (HR for OS: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.72). No significant difference was found between mo CEBPA mutation and wt CEBPA in patients with AML or CN-AML (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bi CEBPA mutations in patients with AML are strongly associated with a favorable prognosis, which suggested that bi CEBPA mutations would potentially serve as a novel prognostic marker in AML.","['Li, Hong-Ying', 'Deng, Dong-Hong', 'Huang, Ying', 'Ye, Fang-Hui', 'Huang, Lu-Lu', 'Xiao, Qiang', 'Zhang, Bing', 'Ye, Bing-Bing', 'Lai, Yong-Rong', 'Mo, Zeng-Nan', 'Liu, Zhen-Fang']","['Li HY', 'Deng DH', 'Huang Y', 'Ye FH', 'Huang LL', 'Xiao Q', 'Zhang B', 'Ye BB', 'Lai YR', 'Mo ZN', 'Liu ZF']","['Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150122,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'biallelic CEBPA mutations', 'meta-analysis', 'prognosis']",2014/09/18 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12450 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 May;94(5):439-48. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12450.

Indeed, a large body of evidence suggests that proliferation, survival and drug resistance of AML are sustained and modulated by the bone marrow immunosuppressive microenvironment, where both innate and adaptive immune responses are profoundly deregulated. Furthermore, the presence of a number of different immunosuppressive mechanisms results in massive immune deregulation, which causes the eventual escape from natural immune control. Modulating the immune system, as documented by 40 years of stem cell transplantation, may improve survival of AML patients, as the immune system is clearly able to recognize and attack leukemic cells. The understanding of the factors responsible for the escape from immune destruction in AML, which becomes more prominent with disease progression, is necessary for the development of innovative immunotherapeutic treatment modalities in AML.","['Isidori, Alessandro', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Ciciarello, Marilena', 'Loscocco, Federica', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Lecciso, Mariangela', 'Ocadlikova, Darina', 'Rossi, Lara', 'Gabucci, Elisa', 'Clissa, Cristina', 'Curti, Antonio']","['Isidori A', 'Salvestrini V', 'Ciciarello M', 'Loscocco F', 'Visani G', 'Parisi S', 'Lecciso M', 'Ocadlikova D', 'Rossi L', 'Gabucci E', 'Clissa C', 'Curti A']","['Haematology and Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Center, AORMN Hospital, Via Lombroso, 1, 61122, Pesaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140916,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', '*Immunity', '*Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'microenvironment', 'tolerogenic', 'tumor immunity']",2014/09/18 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.958464 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Dec;7(6):807-18. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.958464.

Hyperglycemia was defined as a fasting blood glucose >/=126 mg/dL. In cancer patients' hyperglycemia has been associated with impacting diagnostic imaging studies; facilitating the development of and progression of cancers, and influencing response to treatment. Little is known about the impact of hyperglycemia on clinical outcomes such as: neutropenia, infection and hospital length of stay in hospitalized patients with leukemia. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of hyperglycemia on the following clinical outcomes: neutropenia, infection and hospital length of stay. METHODS: This retrospective study examined the prevalence and impact of hyperglycemia on clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population. RESULTS: In this sample of 42 hospitalized patients with leukemia, 60% had at least one incidence of hyperglycemia. Patients with hyperglycemia were 1.6 times more likely (p < 0.01) to experience neutropenia than those without hyperglycemia. However, no difference was noted between those with and without hyperglycemia and risk for infection (p = 0.23). Hospital length of stay was significantly longer in patients with hyperglycemia (2 days versus 15 days; p < 0.001) than those without hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence demonstrating hyperglycemia in the leukemia patient is common and has detrimental effects on clinical outcomes. Understanding the impact of hyperglycemia will inform interventions to mitigate its consequences and improve quality of life for patients with leukemia.","['Storey, Susan', 'Von Ah, Diane']","['Storey S', 'Von Ah D']","['Indiana University School of Nursing, Oncology Clinical Nurse Specialist, St. Vincent Hospital, Indianapolis, IN 46260, United States.

EMS is defined by molecular disruption of the FGFR1 gene at the 8p11-12 chromosome locus, and various partner genes are associated with FGFR1 gene translocation or insertion. The different partner-FGFR1 fusion genes are associated with slightly different disease phenotypes. The present patient showed T lymphoblastic lymphoma in a cervical lymph node, involvement of malignant lymphoma in the skin, and MPN bone marrow morphology with peripheral monocytosis. Chromosome analysis of the patient showed t(1;8)(q25;p11.2). To our knowledge, only 2 cases of EMS with translocation of t(1;8)(q25;p11.2) have been previously reported. Including this case, all 3 cases with EMS with t(1;8)(q25;p11.2) showed MPN bone marrow morphology and peripheral monocytosis. These findings support that t(1;8)(q25;p11.2) is associated with peripheral monocytosis in EMS patients. Of the 2 cases of EMS with t(1;8)(q25;p11.2) which were previously reported, FGFR1 rearrangement was not confirmed in 1 case. Similarly, FGFR1 rearrangement in the present case was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Further study is needed to identify other techniques that could be used to demonstrate FGFR1 rearrangement.","['Kim, Woo-Seong', 'Park, Sang-Gon', 'Park, Geon', 'Jang, Sook-Jin', 'Moon, Dae-Soo', 'Kang, Seong-Ho']","['Kim WS', 'Park SG', 'Park G', 'Jang SJ', 'Moon DS', 'Kang SH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chosun University College of Medicine, Gwangju, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140916,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Skin/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['000363441 [pii]', '10.1159/000363441 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2015;133(1):101-5. doi: 10.1159/000363441.

These neoplasms include adrenocortical carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia and CNS tumors in children and sarcoma, breast cancer and lung cancer in adults. LFS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In most patients germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are found. As the majority of known mutations affect the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein, there are only a few case reports showing the clinical presentation of mutations outside of this mutational hotspot. Here we present a family with a typical LFS pedigree with patients suffering from early-onset lung cancer, bilateral breast cancer and osteosarcoma. TP53 sequence analysis of the index patient revealed the germline mutation c.1025G > C in a heterozygous state, resulting in an amino acid exchange from arginine to proline (p.Arg342Pro) in the tetramerization domain of p53. Using DNA from an old bedside blood typing test, the same mutation was found in the mother of the index patient, who had died of breast cancer 29 years ago. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the co-segregation of a TP53 tetramerization domain mutation and cancer phenotypes, but also report pre-symptomatic mutation carriers within the family. We review published recommendations for clinical management and surveillance of high-risk members in Li-Fraumeni kindreds.","['Etzold, Anna', 'Schroder, Julia C', 'Bartsch, Oliver', 'Zechner, Ulrich', 'Galetzka, Danuta']","['Etzold A', 'Schroder JC', 'Bartsch O', 'Zechner U', 'Galetzka D']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131, Mainz, Germany, anna.sierakowski@unimedizin-mainz.de.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,,IM,"['Adult', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Pedigree']",,,2014/09/18 06:00,2015/12/31 06:00,['2014/09/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10689-014-9754-z [doi]'],ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2015 Mar;14(1):161-5. doi: 10.1007/s10689-014-9754-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TKI monotherapy is not curative, with relapse and persistence of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) remaining a challenge. We have recently identified an AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 protein complex that contributes to the transforming activity of BCR-ABL and IM-resistance in CML stem/progenitor cells. JAK2 thus emerges as an attractive target for improved therapies, but off-target effects of newly developed JAK2 inhibitors on normal hematopoietic cells remain a concern. We have examined the biological effects of a highly selective, orally bioavailable JAK2 inhibitor, BMS-911543, in combination with TKIs on CD34+ treatment-naive IM-nonresponder cells. Combination therapy reduces JAK2/STAT5 and CRKL activities, induces apoptosis, inhibits proliferation and colony growth, and eliminates CML LSCs in vitro. Importantly, BMS-911543 selectively targets CML stem/progenitor cells while sparing healthy stem/progenitor cells. Oral BMS-911543 combined with the potent TKI dasatinib more effectively eliminates infiltrated leukemic cells in hematopoietic tissues than TKI monotherapy and enhances survival of leukemic mice. Dual targeting BCR-ABL and JAK2 activities in CML stem/progenitor cells may consequently lead to more effective disease eradication, especially in patients at high risk of TKI resistance and disease progression.","['Lin, Hanyang', 'Chen, Min', 'Rothe, Katharina', 'Lorenzi, Matthew V', 'Woolfson, Adrian', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Lin H', 'Chen M', 'Rothe K', 'Lorenzi MV', 'Woolfson A', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Sphingosine kinases play a fundamental role in many signaling pathways associated with cancer, suggesting that proteins belonging to this signaling network represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor, respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress response of cells.

Dihydromyricetin decreased ALT, LDH and CKMB levels in mice serum, causing a significant reduction in the toxic death triggered by Adriamycin. The protective effects were also indicated by the alleviation of abnormal electrocardiographic changes, the abrogation of proliferation arrest and apoptotic cell death in primary myocardial cells. Further study revealed that Dihydromyricetin-rescued loss of anti-apoptosis protein ARC provoked by Adriamycin was involved in the cardioprotection.

The biology of pediatric AML, which differs from that of its adult counterpart, is briefly discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Although survival of childhood AML has improved substantially over the past 40 years, progress has reached a plateau. Pediatric AML comprises several subtypes with diverse prognosis. Currently, about 35% of patients die of the disease, and survivors have many debilitating late effects. Clinical trials reported over the past 5 years have revealed several therapeutic concepts. First, initial intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy is necessary to sufficiently reduce minimal residual disease and is associated with improved disease-free survival. Second, postremission chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is necessary to eradicate AML. Third, central nervous system leukemia can be adequately managed with intrathecal chemotherapy and rarely requires radiotherapy.

Typically, data for ~10(2) cells can be acquired within a 1 hr experiment. An automated image analysis program enables efficient post-experiment analysis of image data, enabling processing to be complete within a few hours. Our device geometry is unique in that cells must deform through a series of micron-scale constrictions, thereby enabling the initial deformation and time-dependent relaxation of individual cells to be assayed. The applicability of this method to human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells is demonstrated. Driving cells to deform through micron-scale constrictions using pressure-driven flow, we observe that human promyelocytic (HL-60) cells momentarily occlude the first constriction for a median time of 9.3 msec before passaging more quickly through the subsequent constrictions with a median transit time of 4.0 msec per constriction. By contrast, all-trans retinoic acid-treated (neutrophil-type) HL-60 cells occlude the first constriction for only 4.3 msec before passaging through the subsequent constrictions with a median transit time of 3.3 msec. This method can provide insight into the viscoelastic nature of cells, and ultimately reveal the molecular origins of this behavior.","['Hoelzle, David J', 'Varghese, Bino A', 'Chan, Clara K', 'Rowat, Amy C']","['Hoelzle DJ', 'Varghese BA', 'Chan CK', 'Rowat AC']","['Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles; Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles; Molecular Imaging Center, University of Southern California.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles; rowat@ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20140903,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '63148-62-9 (baysilon)']",IM,"['Cell Shape/physiology', 'Cytological Techniques/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes/chemistry', 'Equipment Design', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation/*methods']",,,2014/09/17 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/51474 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2014 Sep 3;(91):e51474. doi: 10.3791/51474.,,,PMC4828024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexes were thoroughly characterized, including multinuclear high resolution NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X-ray analysis (for complexes 1 and 3). The complexes were screened for their in vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines MCF7 (breast carcinoma), HOS (osteosarcoma) and THP-1 (monocytic leukaemia), which identified the complexes 4-6 as the most promising representatives, who antiproliferative activity was further tested against A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), G-361 (melanoma), HeLa (cervical cancer), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), A2780R (ovarian carcinoma resistant to cisplatin), 22Rv1 (prostate cancer) cell lines. Complexes 4-6 showed a significantly higher in vitro anticancer effect against the employed cancer cells, except for G-361, as compared with the commercially used anticancer drug cisplatin, with IC50 approximately 1-30 microM. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vitro by the assessment of the ability of the complexes to modulate secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), in the lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophage-like THP-1 cell model. The results of this study identified the complexes as auspicious anti-inflammatory agents with similar or better activity as compared with the clinically applied gold-based antiarthritic drug Auranofin. In an effort to explore the possible mechanisms responsible for the biological effect, the products of interactions of selected complexes with sulfur-containing biomolecules (L-cysteine and reduced glutathione) were studied by means of the mass-spectrometry study.","['Krikavova, Radka', 'Hosek, Jan', 'Vanco, Jan', 'Hutyra, Jakub', 'Dvorak, Zdenek', 'Travnicek, Zdenek']","['Krikavova R', 'Hosek J', 'Vanco J', 'Hutyra J', 'Dvorak Z', 'Travnicek Z']","['Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials & Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials & Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials & Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials & Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials & Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials & Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140916,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '26D26OA393 (triphenylphosphine)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity']",,,2014/09/17 06:00,2015/05/28 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107373 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-28758 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 16;9(9):e107373. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107373. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4167326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three forms (beta-, gamma-, and delta-T3) inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner; delta-T3 showed the strongest growth-inhibitory effect. delta-T3 increased the G1, G2/M, and subG1 populations and induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. delta-T3 treatment also increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3, -6, -7, -9, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), and this was accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP. Moreover, delta-T3 decreased nuclear p65 NF-kappaB levels, indicating downregulation of NF-kappaB activity. This cytotoxic effect of delta-T3 was abrogated by squalene (SQL) but not mevalonate (MVL), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), or cholesterol (CL). delta-T3 decreased intracellular SQL levels, and inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis did not affect the action of SQL. Furthermore, delta-T3 significantly decreased farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) expression. Taken together, it is evident that delta-T3, due to its ability to potently induce apoptosis via the depletion of intracellular SQL, shows the potential to be considered a therapeutic agent in patients with ATL.","['Yamasaki, Masao', 'Nishimura, Misato', 'Sakakibara, Yoichi', 'Suiko, Masahito', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Nishiyama, Kazuo']","['Yamasaki M', 'Nishimura M', 'Sakakibara Y', 'Suiko M', 'Morishita K', 'Nishiyama K']","['Department of Biochemistry and Applied Biosciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuenkibanadai-nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan. myamasaki@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp nishiyam@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '1SRB74OWSI (tocotrienol, delta)', '7QWM220FJH (Squalene)', 'EC 2.5.1.21 (Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 6/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Squalene/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2014/09/17 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4fo00635f [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2014 Nov;5(11):2842-9. doi: 10.1039/c4fo00635f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially relevant in the pediatric population where both hematogenous malignancy requiring intrathecal drug delivery and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus are more prevalent. Intrathecal and intraventricular chemotherapy agents can be prematurely diverted in these shunt-dependent patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the use of a stop-flow programmable shunt valve to maximize delivery of intraventricular chemotherapy in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation who presented with spontaneous intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhages. The patient then developed posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and eventually progressed to shunt dependence but still required frequent intraventricular chemotherapy administration. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt, equipped with a valve that allows for near cessation of cerebrospinal fluid flow (Certas((R)), Codman, Raynham, MA), and a contralateral Ommaya reservoir were inserted to maximize intraventricular dissemination of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the use of a high-resistance programmable valve being used to virtually cease cerebrospinal fluid flow through the distal catheter temporarily in order to maximize intraventricular drug dissemination in a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Palejwala, Sheri K', 'Stidd, David A', 'Skoch, Jesse M', 'Gupta, Puja', 'Lemole, G Michael Jr', 'Weinand, Martin E']","['Palejwala SK', 'Stidd DA', 'Skoch JM', 'Gupta P', 'Lemole GM Jr', 'Weinand ME']","['Department of Surgery, Division of Neurosurgery, University of Arizona, 1501 N.

METHOD: The study was a randomised, controlled, study design. Patients >/=16 years scheduled for allogeneic stem cell transplantation were included consecutively and randomised to experimental group receiving OC combined with Caphosol((R)) (n = 20) or control group receiving OC only (n = 20). OC was given from start to end of HDCT. Caphosol((R)), from day 0 to day 21. RESULT: There were no significant differences regarding age or gender between the groups. Mucositis was assessed with the World Health Organisation (WHO) grading scale. Pain was assessed with a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain. Start and duration of therapy with pain relieving drugs, serum C-reactive protein values, and number of days of hospitalisation were collected from the medical records. Data on OM, oral pain, use of i.v. opioids and total parenteral nutrition were collected during 22 days. There was no significant difference between the groups on OM, oral pain, use of i.v. opioids or TPN between the groups.

Given the unique demands that childhood cancer places on parents, it is important to determine whether intrusiveness operates differently in survivors of childhood cancer. The current study tested whether cancer survivorship moderates the relation between maternal directiveness-one aspect of intrusiveness-and children's internalizing problems. Survivors (7-12 years old) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 25) and their mothers, and healthy controls (n = 22) and their mothers engaged in parent-child interactions. Mothers completed a measure of children's psychosocial adjustment, and observations of 10-min parent-child interactions were obtained. Cancer survivorship moderated the relation between directiveness and children's withdrawn/depressed symptoms. Maternal directiveness was associated with increased withdrawn/depressed symptoms for children in the control group. This association was not significant for survivors of ALL. Findings suggest that childhood cancer may alter the context in which children experience maternal directiveness.","['Kawamura, Joy', 'Katz, Lynn Fainsilber', 'Breiger, David']","['Kawamura J', 'Katz LF', 'Breiger D']","['Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Box 351525, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA, jkawamur@u.washington.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Psychol Med Settings,Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,9435680,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders/complications/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mother-Child Relations', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Parenting/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*psychology', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,,2014/09/17 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10880-014-9410-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Psychol Med Settings. 2014 Dec;21(4):329-36. doi: 10.1007/s10880-014-9410-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sequenced 40 recurrently mutated myeloid malignancy genes in tumor DNA from 213 MDS patients collected before treatment with azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DEC). Mutations were examined for association with response and overall survival. The overall response rate of 47% was not different between agents. Clonal TET2 mutations predicted response (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, P = .036) when subclones unlikely to be detected by Sanger sequencing (allele fraction <10%) were treated as wild-type (WT). Response rates were highest in the subset of TET2 mutant patients without clonal ASXL1 mutations (OR 3.65, P = .009). Mutations of TP53 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01, P = .002) and PTPN11 (HR 3.26, P = .006) were associated with shorter overall survival but not drug response. Murine-competitive bone marrow transplantation followed by treatment with AZA demonstrated that Tet2-null cells have an engraftment advantage over Tet2-WT cells. AZA significantly decreased this advantage for Tet2-null cells (P = .002) but not Tet2-WT cells (P = .212). Overall, Tet2 loss appears to sensitize cells to treatment with AZA in vivo, and TET2 mutations can identify patients more likely to respond to HMAs.","['Bejar, Rafael', 'Lord, Allegra', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Perez-Ladaga, Albert', 'Zaneveld, Jacques', 'Wang, Hui', 'Caughey, Bennett', 'Stojanov, Petar', 'Getz, Gad', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Chen, Rui', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Steensma, David P', 'Ebert, Benjamin L']","['Bejar R', 'Lord A', 'Stevenson K', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Perez-Ladaga A', 'Zaneveld J', 'Wang H', 'Caughey B', 'Stojanov P', 'Getz G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Chen R', 'Stone RM', 'Neuberg D', 'Steensma DP', 'Ebert BL']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA;', ""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;"", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematological Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA;', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA;', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematological Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematological Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', ""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140915,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Dioxygenases', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transplantation Chimera/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,,2014/09/17 06:00,2015/01/27 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35441-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-582809 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Oct 23;124(17):2705-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-582809.

However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), triggered by alloreactive donor cells, has remained a major complication. Here, we show an inverse correlation between plasma alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) levels in human donors and the development of acute GVHD in the recipients (n = 111; P = .0006). In murine models, treatment of transplant donors with human AAT resulted in an increase in interleukin-10 messenger RNA and CD8(+)CD11c(+)CD205(+) major histocompatibility complex class II(+) dendritic cells (DCs), and the prevention or attenuation of acute GVHD in the recipients. Ablation of DCs (in AAT-treated CD11c-DTR donors) decreased CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells to one-third and abrogated the anti-GVHD effect. The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect of donor cells (against A20 tumor cells) was maintained or even enhanced with AAT treatment of the donor, mediated by an expanded population of NK1.1(+), CD49B(+), CD122(+), CD335(+) NKG2D-expressing natural killer (NK) cells. Blockade of NKG2D significantly suppressed the GVL effect. Metabolic analysis showed a high glycolysis-high oxidative phosphorylation profile for NK1.1(+) cells, CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells, and CD11c(+) DCs but not for effector T cells, suggesting a cell type-specific effect of AAT. Thus, via altered metabolism, AAT exerts effective GVHD protection while enhancing GVL effects.","['Marcondes, A Mario', 'Karoopongse, Ekapun', 'Lesnikova, Marina', 'Margineantu, Daciana', 'Welte, Tobias', 'Dinarello, Charles A', 'Hockenbery, David', 'Janciauskiene, Sabina', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Marcondes AM', 'Karoopongse E', 'Lesnikova M', 'Margineantu D', 'Welte T', 'Dinarello CA', 'Hockenbery D', 'Janciauskiene S', 'Deeg HJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; and Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140915,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD11c Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Demography', '*Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Siblings', 'Superoxides/metabolism', '*Tissue Donors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/blood/*pharmacology']",,,2014/09/17 06:00,2015/02/28 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39692-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-570440 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Oct 30;124(18):2881-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-570440.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of T-cell-replete haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) with low-dose anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG), tacrolimus, methotrexate and prednisolone (PSL) in 14 paediatric patients with high-risk childhood acute leukaemia. RESULTS: All patients achieved complete engraftment. The median time to reaching an absolute neutrophil count of more than 0.5 x 10(9) L(-1) was 14 days. Acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) of grades II-IV and III-IV developed in 10 (71%) and 2 (14%) patients, respectively. Treatment-related mortality and relapse occurred in one (7%) patient and six (43%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were alive and seven of them were disease-free with a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 30-159 months). The probability of event-free survival after 2 years was 50%. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that T-cell-replete haplo-SCT, with low-dose ATG and PSL, provides sustained remission with an acceptable risk of GVHD in paediatric patients with advanced haematologic malignancies.","['Kobayashi, S', 'Ito, M', 'Sano, H', 'Mochizuki, K', 'Akaihata, M', 'Waragai, T', 'Ohara, Y', 'Hosoya, M', 'Ohto, H', 'Kikuta, A']","['Kobayashi S', 'Ito M', 'Sano H', 'Mochizuki K', 'Akaihata M', 'Waragai T', 'Ohara Y', 'Hosoya M', 'Ohto H', 'Kikuta A']",['Department of Pediatric Oncology.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20140915,England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation', 'T-cell-replete haploidentical stem cell transplantation', 'children', 'graft-vs-leukaemia effect', 'refractory leukaemia']",2014/09/17 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tme.12150 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfus Med. 2014 Oct;24(5):305-10. doi: 10.1111/tme.12150.

He showed that two viruses - murine leukemia virus and parotid tumor virus - could cause cancer when they were injected into susceptible animals. At first, Gross's discoveries were greeted with skepticism: it seemed implausible that viruses could cause a disease as complex as cancer. Inspired by Gross's initial experiments, similar results were obtained by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy who later renamed the parotid tumor virus SE polyoma virus after finding it could cause many different types of tumors in mice, hamsters, and rats. Eventually the ""SE"" was dropped and virologists adopted the name ""polyoma virus."" After Gross's work was published, additional viruses capable of causing solid tumors or blood-borne tumors in mice were described by Arnold Graffi, Charlotte Friend, John Moloney and others. By 1961, sufficient data had been accumulated for Gross to confidently publish an extensive monograph--Oncogenic Viruses--the first history of tumor virology, which became a standard reference work and marked the emergence of tumor virology as a distinct, legitimate field of study.","['Morgan, Gregory J']",['Morgan GJ'],"['College of Arts and Letters, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA.

With long life expectancy, the development of subsequent cancers is an important concern for survivors of thyroid cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and types of second primary malignancies in Korean patients with thyroid cancer. METHODS: The study cohort included 178,844 registrants with thyroid cancer from the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) database between 1993 and 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using a statistical software program (SEER*Stat 8.0.4). RESULTS: Among 178,844 patients with thyroid cancer, 2895 (1.6%) were diagnosed with subsequent second primary malignancies. The overall risks of a second primary cancer were elevated by 6% in patients who had thyroid cancer compared with the general population during the same period. The elevated risks for developing second cancers were observed in all sites except the stomach and cervix. The elevated risk of second primary cancers was observed within the first 10 years of follow-up. Leukemia and cancers of the salivary gland, kidney, prostate, lung, and breast had the most significantly elevated risks as secondary cancers and presented as early as during the first 5 years after the initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest, standardized, population-based study to date using nationwide data from the entire Korean population. The risks of several cancers were elevated significantly during follow-up, thus alerting physicians to pay special attention in their care of patients with thyroid cancer and long-term survivors.","['Cho, Yoon Young', 'Lim, Jiwon', 'Oh, Chang-Mo', 'Ryu, Junsun', 'Jung, Kyu-Won', 'Chung, Jae Hoon', 'Won, Young-Joo', 'Kim, Sun Wook']","['Cho YY', 'Lim J', 'Oh CM', 'Ryu J', 'Jung KW', 'Chung JH', 'Won YJ', 'Kim SW']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Thyroid Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140915,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Republic of Korea', 'adult', 'risk', 'second malignancy', 'thyroid neoplasm']",2014/09/17 06:00,2015/03/10 06:00,['2014/09/17 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29025 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jan 15;121(2):259-68. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29025.

METHODS: This phase II study randomized 125 patients 2:1 to CPX-351 or investigators' choice of first salvage chemotherapy. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first relapse after initial Complete Remission (CR) lasting >/=1 month were stratified per the European Prognostic Index (EPI) into favorable, intermediate, and poor-risk groups based on duration of first CR, cytogenetics, age, and transplant history. Control salvage treatment was usually based on cytarabine and anthracycline, often with 1 or more additional agents. Survival at 1 year was the primary efficacy end point. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were well balanced between the 2 study arms. Improvements in efficacy outcomes were observed following CPX-351, but did not meet prospectively defined statistical criteria for 1-year survival improvement in the overall population. Subset analyses of the EPI-defined poor-risk strata demonstrated higher response rates (39.3% vs 27.6%) and improvements in event-free survival (HR, 0.63; P = .08) and overall survival (HR, 0.55; P = .02). Also, 60-day mortality was lower in the CPX-351 study arm for poor-risk patients (16.1% vs 24.1%).

Karyotype analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype of 47,XYY [14]/46,XYY,-21[16]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed the existence of a PML-RARA fusion gene. The patient was treated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy. Laboratory results revealed that the coagulopathy improved and the patient achieved complete remission, based on bone-marrow morphology. The patient then received sequential monthly therapy using arsenic trioxide, followed by ATRA, followed by chemotherapy; he has survived disease-free for 36 months.

In this study we examined the outcome, risks of second cancers, and cardiac mortality with RT for early-stage BC from recent years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of the SEER database was conducted for women who had stage T1aN0 BC as their first primary malignancy between 1990 and 1997 and were treated with partial or complete mastectomy with or without external beam RT. The overall survival (OS), BC-specific survival (BCSS), cardiac cause-specific survival (CCS), and deaths from second cancers in the chest area were compared between the RT and no-RT groups. RESULTS: Of the 6515 women identified, 2796 received RT and 3719 did not. The median age group (60-64 years) and follow-up lengths (approximately 15 years) were similar. Compared with the RT group, the no-RT group was associated with lower 10-year OS (85.5% vs. 79.3%; P < .0001), BCSS (97.3% vs. 96.4%; P = .04), and CCS (97.0% vs. 93.8%; P < .0001). In the RT group, left-sided BC was not associated with higher cardiac mortality. There were no statistically significant incidences in mortality due to subsequent cancers. The most common second cancer mortality included 114 (2%) lung, 25 (0.4%) lymphoma, 19 (0.3%) leukemia, 3 (0.05%) soft tissue, and 2 (0.03%) esophagus. CONCLUSION: This review of SEER data suggests that secondary malignancy in the chest area and cardiac mortality are rare after RT in the 1990s for T1aN0 BC.","['Ye, Jason C', 'Yan, Weisi', 'Christos, Paul', 'Nori, Dattatreyudu', 'Chao, Kun-San C', 'Ravi, Akkamma']","['Ye JC', 'Yan W', 'Christos P', 'Nori D', 'Chao KS', 'Ravi A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; Department of Radiation Oncology, New York Hospital Queens, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.

In this study, we compared haplo-HSCT with conventional consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy in adult high-risk ALL patients. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 104 patients received conventional chemotherapy and 79 patients received haplo-HSCT. Patients who underwent haplo-HSCT had significantly improved 3-year OS (72.5% vs 26.6%; P<0.001), 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) (63.9% vs 21.1%; P<0.001) and 3-year relapse (18.7% vs 60.5%; P<0.001) rates. The non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate was not different between patients treated with haplo-HSCT vs chemotherapy (19.2% vs 14.4%; P=0.80). In multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with improved OS, better DFS and low risk of relapse was haplo-HSCT. The only factor associated with high NRM was enrollment before 2006.

To explore the prognostic role of high CD20 expression in pediatric BCP-ALL, we performed a meta-analysis of the previous studies that provided survival information according to CD20 expression status. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) indicated that high CD20 expression had no inferior impact on the prognosis of pediatric BCP-ALL. The summary HR for overall survival was 0.70 and combined HR for event-free survival was 1.01. These findings suggest that high CD20 expression does not influence the outcome for pediatric BCP-ALL.

Thus, there is a demand for the development of more selective and effective antitumor agents. This study showed that A398, a novel podophyllotoxin analogue, was cytotoxic to the HT-29, MCF-7, MOLT-4 and HL-60 tumor cell lines, being less active in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal cell lines FGH and IEC-6. Tests using the HepG2 lineage indicated that its metabolites do not contribute to its cytotoxicity. In the HL-60 cells, A398 induced apoptosis in a time and concentration-dependent manner, promoting mitochondrial depolarization, inhibition of Bcl-2, phosphatidylserine exposure, activation of caspases -8, -9 and -3, and DNA fragmentation. The production of reactive oxygen species does not seem to be a crucial event for the apoptotic process. Pretreatment with specific inhibitors of kinases ERK1/2, JNK and p38 resulted in an increased percentage of death induced by A398.

It is believed that the coordination (formation of covalent bond) of the metal (platinum) to the nitrogen bases of DNA cause the ruptures of the cancer as well as normal cells. A search for anticancer drugs with different modes of action resulted in the synthesis of variety of novel compounds. Many of them are in clinical trials now. Recently we synthesized a series of novel rhenium pentylcarbonato compounds (PC1-PC6). The rhenium atom in each compound is coordinated (bonded) to a planar polypyridyl aromatic ligand, thereby forcing each compound to intercalate between the DNA bases. We have investigated the DNA binding properties of one of the PC-series of compounds (PC6) using electronic spectroscopy. The UV absorption titration of PC6 with DNA shows hypochromic effect with concomitant bathochromic shift of the charge transfer band at 290 nm. These results suggest that the compound PC6 binds to DNA through intercalation. It is therefore likely that the other PC-series of compounds will behave in a similar manner. Thus it is expected that these compounds will exhibit negligible or no side effect. We have observed that the PC-series of compounds are strong cytotoxic agents against lymphosarcoma (average GI50 approximately 2+/-2.6 microM), PC-3 prostate (average GI50 approximately 3+/-2.8 microM) and myeloid leukemia (average GI50 approximately 3+/-2.8 microM) cancer cell lines. The average GI50 values of the PC-series of compounds are 2-3 less than the corresponding GI50 values of cisplatin. Also each of the PC-series of compounds exhibits less toxicity than cisplatin in the glomerular mesangial cells.","['Parson, Carl', 'Smith, Valerie', 'Krauss, Christopher', 'Banerjee, Hirendra N', 'Reilly, Christopher', 'Krause, Jeanette A', 'Wachira, James M', 'Giri, Dipak', 'Winstead, Angela', 'Mandal, Santosh K']","['Parson C', 'Smith V', 'Krauss C', 'Banerjee HN', 'Reilly C', 'Krause JA', 'Wachira JM', 'Giri D', 'Winstead A', 'Mandal SK']","['Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Elizabeth City State University-University of North Carolina, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, USA.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Elizabeth City State University-University of North Carolina, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, USA.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Elizabeth City State University-University of North Carolina, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, USA.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Elizabeth City State University-University of North Carolina, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD 21251, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD 21251, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD 21251, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD 21251, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Bioprocess Biotech,Journal of bioprocessing & biotechniques,101622306,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA binding', 'PC-3 prostate', 'Rhenium compounds', 'bathochromic shift', 'cancer cells', 'electronic spectroscopy', 'hypochromic effect', 'lymphosarcoma', 'mesangial cells', 'myeloid leukemia']",2014/09/16 06:00,2014/09/16 06:01,['2014/09/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4172/2155-9821.1000141 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bioprocess Biotech. 2013 Dec 27;4(1):141. doi: 10.4172/2155-9821.1000141.,,"['G11 HD038439/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM082808/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4160084,['NIHMS574095'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GASC1, member of the histone demethylases affecting heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression, has been found to be dysregulation in many types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, metastatic lung sarcomatoid carcinoma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the expression of GASC1 and certain GASC1-targeted genes (KLF4, MYC, SOX2, PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG) and identified a three-gene prognostic signature (PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG), using risk scores based on immunohistochemical analyses of 149 tumor specimens from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The presence of a high-risk three-gene signature in the ESCC tumors was significantly associated with decreased overall survival (OS) of the patients. We validated the predictive value of the three-gene signature in a second independent cohort of 101 patients with ESCC in order to determine whether it had predictive value. The results were similar to those in 149 patients. According to multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses, the predictive model of a three-gene signature was an independent predictor for OS (p = 0.005 in cohort 1, p = 0.025 in cohort 2). In addition, ROC analysis indicated that the predictive ability of the three-gene model was more robust than that of a single biomarker. Therefore, our three-gene signature is closely associated with OS among patients with ESCC and may serve as a predictor for the poor prognosis of ESCC patients.","['Sun, Ling-Ling', 'Wu, Jian-Yi', 'Wu, Zhi-Yong', 'Shen, Jin-Hui', 'Xu, Xiu-E', 'Chen, Bo', 'Wang, Shao-Hong', 'Li, En-Min', 'Xu, Li-Yan']","['Sun LL', 'Wu JY', 'Wu ZY', 'Shen JH', 'Xu XE', 'Chen B', 'Wang SH', 'Li EM', 'Xu LY']","['Institute of Oncologic Pathology, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for High Cancer Incidence Coastal Chaoshan Area, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, China; Department of Pathology, Shaoyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Shaoyang Hospital of University of South China, Shaoyang, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140924,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (KDM4C protein, human)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",['NOTNLM'],"['esophageal squamous cell carcinoma', 'gene prognostic signature', 'histone demethylase', 'histopathology']",2014/09/16 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/09/16 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29211 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Mar 15;136(6):E569-77. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29211.

It was shown that the venom of E. quadridens and its peptide fraction in particular possess marked antibacterial action. Three linear antimicrobial peptides sharing low similarity to the well-known ponericin peptides were isolated from this ant venom by means of size-exclusion and reversed-phase chromatography. The peptides showed antimicrobial activity at low micromolar concentrations. Their primary structure was established by direct Edman sequencing in combination with mass spectrometry. The most active peptide designated ponericin-Q42 was chemically synthesized. Its secondary structure was investigated in aqueous and membrane-mimicking environment, and the peptide was shown to be partially helical already in water, which is unusual for short linear peptides. Analysis of its activity on different bacterial strains, human erythrocytes and chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells revealed that the peptide shows broad spectrum cytolytic activity at micromolar and submicromolar concentrations. Ponericin-Q42 also possesses weak toxic activity on flesh fly larvae with LD50 of approximately 105 mug/g.","['Pluzhnikov, Kirill A', 'Kozlov, Sergey A', 'Vassilevski, Alexander A', 'Vorontsova, Olga V', 'Feofanov, Alexei V', 'Grishin, Eugene V']","['Pluzhnikov KA', 'Kozlov SA', 'Vassilevski AA', 'Vorontsova OV', 'Feofanov AV', 'Grishin EV']","['Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, ul.

Here, we retrospectively examined the prognostic impact of early remission (ER) vs. delayed remission (DR) in a cohort of 132 AML patients with an intermediate-risk karyotype undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in first complete remission (CR1). In contrast to patients showing DR, patients achieving ER had a significantly higher 3-yr overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 76% vs. 54% (P = 0.03) and 76% vs. 53% (P = 0.03). Likewise, 3 yr after alloSCT the cumulative incidence of relapse (CI-R) was significantly lower in the ER subgroup as compared to patients achieving DR, that is, 10% vs. 35% (P = 0.004), whereas non-relapse mortality (NRM) did not differ significantly. Multivariate analysis identified DR as an independent prognosticator for an inferior DFS (HR 3.37, P = 0.002) and a higher CI-R (HR 3.55, P = 0.002). Taken together, these data may indicate that the rapid achievement of remission predicts a favorable outcome in patients with intermediate-risk AML undergoing alloSCT in CR1.

Dysregulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a major cause of human diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and neurological diseases. Indeed, protein tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated signaling events offer ample therapeutic targets, and drug discovery efforts to date have brought over two dozen kinase inhibitors to the clinic. Accordingly, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are considered next-generation drug targets. For instance, PTP1B is a well-known targets of type 2 diabetes and obesity, and recent studies indicate that it is also a promising target for breast cancer. SHP2 is a bona-fide oncoprotein, mutations of which cause juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and solid tumors. In addition, LYP is strongly associated with type 1 diabetes and many other autoimmune diseases. This review summarizes recent findings on several highly recognized PTP family drug targets, including PTP1B, Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2(SHP2), lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), CD45, Fas associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1), striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatases (STEP), mitogen-activated protein kinase/dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), phosphatases of regenerating liver-1 (PRL), low molecular weight PTPs (LMWPTP), and CDC25. Given that there are over 100 family members, we hope this review will serve as a road map for innovative drug discovery targeting PTPs.","['He, Rong-Jun', 'Yu, Zhi-Hong', 'Zhang, Ruo-Yu', 'Zhang, Zhong-Yin']","['He RJ', 'Yu ZH', 'Zhang RY', 'Zhang ZY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20140915,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Discovery/methods', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,,2014/09/16 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/09/16 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201480 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2014.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2014 Oct;35(10):1227-46. doi: 10.1038/aps.2014.80.

Knockdown of KAT6A in SUM-52 cells, a luminal breast cancer cell line harboring the amplicon, resulted in reduced growth rate compared to non-silencing controls and profound loss of clonogenic capacity both in mono-layer and in soft agar. The normal cell line MCF10A, however, did not exhibit slower growth with knockdown of KAT6A. SUM-52 cells with KAT6A knockdown formed fewer mammospheres in culture compared to controls, suggesting a possible role for KAT6A in self-renewal. Previous data from our laboratory identified FGFR2 as a driving oncogene in SUM-52 cells. The colony forming efficiency of SUM-52 KAT6A knockdown cells in the presence of FGFR inhibition was significantly reduced compared to cells with KAT6A knockdown only. These data suggest that KAT6A may be a novel oncogene in breast cancers bearing the 8p11-p12 amplicon. While there are other putative oncogenes in the amplicon, the identification of KAT6A as a driving oncogene suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes are a key class of oncogenes in these cancers, and play an important role in the selection of this amplicon in luminal B breast cancers.","['Turner-Ivey, Brittany', 'Guest, Stephen T', 'Irish, Jonathan C', 'Kappler, Christiana S', 'Garrett-Mayer, Elizabeth', 'Wilson, Robert C', 'Ethier, Stephen P']","['Turner-Ivey B', 'Guest ST', 'Irish JC', 'Kappler CS', 'Garrett-Mayer E', 'Wilson RC', 'Ethier SP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.

When transgenically expressed in hematopoietic cells, mice faithfully recapitulate human disease with serial progression from peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias and increased bone marrow (BM) blasts to acute leukemia. It is well accepted that genomic instability in dysplastic hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) drives the evolution of MDS to acute leukemia. Findings here demonstrate that reticulocytes, myeloid and lymphoid PB cells of NHD13 mice, display an increase in the age-associated loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked surface proteins versus wild type controls. These data correlate with a progressive increase in the DNA damage response as measured by gamma-H2AX activity, accumulating BM blasts as the disease progresses and finally development of acute leukemia. These findings clearly demonstrate a state of progressive genomic instability that increases the likelihood of a ""second hit"" or complimentary mutation later in the disease to trigger development of acute leukemia and underscores the mechanistic nature of how the NUP98-HoxD13 transgene induces progression of MDS to acute leukemia. Additionally, these data support the use of the PIG-A assay as an efficient, real-time surrogate marker of the genomic instability that occurs in the MDS HSPCs. Key Point The PIG-A assay is a sensitive, nonlethal method for the serial assessment of genomic instability in mouse models of MDS.","['Byrne, Michael', 'Bennett, Richard L', 'Cheng, Xiaodong', 'May, W Stratford']","['Byrne M', 'Bennett RL', 'Cheng X', 'May WS']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology and the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology and the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology and the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology and the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL 32610.

Although aberrant epigenetic changes are frequently implicated in blood cancers, their direct role in suppressing one or both alleles of critical splicing factors has not been previously examined. Here, we examined promoter DNA hypermethylation of nine splicing factors, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, SF3A1, HNRNPR, MATR3, ZFR, and YBX3 in 10 leukemic cell lines and 94 MDS or AML patient samples from the Australasian Leukemia and Lymphoma Group Tissue Bank. The only evidence of epigenetic effects was hypermethylation of the YBX3 promoter in U937 cells in conjunction with an enrichment of histone marks associated with gene silencing. In silico analysis of DNA methylation data for 173 AML samples generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network revealed promoter hypermethylation of the gene encoding Y box binding protein 3, YBX3, in 11/173 (6.4%) AML cases, which was significantly associated with reduced mRNA expression (P < 0.0001). Hypermethylation of the ZRSR2 promoter was also detected in 7/173 (4%) cases but was not associated with decreased mRNA expression (P = 0.1204). Hypermethylation was absent at the promoter of seven other splicing factor genes in all cell lines and patient samples examined. We conclude that DNA hypermethylation does not frequently silence splicing factors in MDS and AML. However, in the case of YBX3, promoter hypermethylation-induced downregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis or maintenance of AML.","['Wong, Justin J-L', 'Lau, Katherine A', 'Pinello, Natalia', 'Rasko, John E J']","['Wong JJ', 'Lau KA', 'Pinello N', 'Rasko JE']","['Gene and Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia; Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141018,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (ZRSR2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*RNA Splicing', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'DNA hypermethylation', 'epigenetics', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'splicing factors']",2014/09/16 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2014/09/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12532 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Nov;105(11):1457-63. doi: 10.1111/cas.12532.

Using differentiation of primary erythroid cells as a model, we show that the sequence-specific mRNA-binding protein Cpeb4 is strongly induced by the erythroid-important transcription factors Gata1 and Tal1 and is essential for terminal erythropoiesis. By interacting with the translation initiation factor eIF3, Cpeb4 represses the translation of a large set of mRNAs, including its own mRNA. Thus, transcriptional induction and translational repression combine to form a negative feedback loop to control Cpeb4 protein levels within a specific range that is required for terminal erythropoiesis. Our study provides an example of how translational control is integrated with transcriptional regulation to precisely control gene expression during mammalian cell differentiation.","['Hu, Wenqian', 'Yuan, Bingbing', 'Lodish, Harvey F']","['Hu W', 'Yuan B', 'Lodish HF']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

While lineage tracking experiments indicated that iCD8alpha cells have a lymphoid origin, their development was independent of the transcriptional suppressor Id2, suggesting that these cells do not belong to the family of innate lymphoid cells. Finally, we identified cells with a similar phenotype in humans, which were profoundly depleted in newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis.

We aimed to evaluate time trends in CLL incidence and medical resource utilisation of CLL patients in the UK. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort analysis using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) comprising mainly primary care data. We included adult patients with newly diagnosed CLL between January 2000 and June 2012. Descriptive and trend analyses of CLL incidence and medical resource utilisation were performed. A total of 2576 patients with CLL met the eligibility criteria. At diagnosis, the majority of patients (71.7 %) were above 65 years of age. The European age-standardised CLL incidence rate in the CPRD was 6.2/100,000 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 6.0, 6.5/100,000) person-years. There was no statistically significant increase over time. The CLL patients had on average 74.6 general practitioner visits during a median follow-up of 3.3 years. Between 2000 and 2012, the average number of recorded hospitalisations and referrals per year corrected for duration of follow-up significantly (p < 0.001) increased by 8.1 % (95 % CI 6.8 %, 9.3 %) and 16.4 % (95 % CI 15.4 %, 17.3 %), respectively. Referrals and hospitalisations in the second year compared to the first year following the CLL diagnosis significantly decreased. CLL incidence rates in the CPRD were stable over the period from 2000 to 2012.

There is a need to document health and function in the everyday lives of young children with cancer using the multidimensional framework and language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health--Children and Youth (ICF-CY). AIMS: The aims of this study were (1) to document health and functioning in the everyday lives of young children with cancer using ICF-CY codes and (2) to identify a comprehensive code set that can aid clinical assessment. METHOD: Interviews with children diagnosed with cancer and their parents, were transcribed, reviewed for content and coded to the ICF-CY using linking procedures. RESULTS: A comprehensive code set (n = 70) for childhood cancer was identified. The majority of content identified to codes was related to activity and participation describing social relations with family, peers and professionals, preschool attendance and play, as well as issues related to support and independence. CONCLUSIONS: The ICF-CY can be used to document the nature and range of characteristics and consequences of cancer experienced by children. The identified comprehensive code set could be helpful to health care professionals, parents and teachers in assessing and supporting young children's health and everyday life through the cancer trajectory. The comprehensive code set could be developed as a clinical assessment tool for those caring for young children with cancer. The universal language of the ICF-CY means that the utility of a clinical assessment tool based on identified codes can have wide reaching effects for the care of young children with cancer.","['Darcy, L', 'Enskar, K', 'Granlund, M', 'Simeonsson, R J', 'Peterson, C', 'Bjork, M']","['Darcy L', 'Enskar K', 'Granlund M', 'Simeonsson RJ', 'Peterson C', 'Bjork M']","['CHILD Research Group, School of Health Sciences, Jonkoping University, Jonkoping, Sweden; School of Health Sciences, University College Boras, Boras, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140915,England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living/*psychology', 'Brain Neoplasms/physiopathology/*psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Disabled Children/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Self Concept', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Social Environment', '*Social Support']",['NOTNLM'],"['ICF-CY', 'everyday life', 'functioning', 'health', 'paediatric cancer']",2014/09/16 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2014/09/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cch.12191 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2015 May;41(3):475-82. doi: 10.1111/cch.12191.

Sequencing an individual's genome can have a substantial impact on the patient's treatment and overall quality of life. However, this can open ""Pandora's box"" especially if an individual does not want to know the information obtained. In addition, will insurance companies require genetic testing in order to pay for a targeted treatment? If the patient refuses to have the genetic testing, will they have to pay for their treatment out of pocket? In the human interest story presented, the researcher and his team discovered over activity of the FTL3 protein through RNA sequencing which resulted in rapid proliferation of his leukemic cells. He identified a drug marketed for advanced kidney cancer which was a FTL3 inhibitor. However, his insurance company refused to pay for the drug because it was not a known treatment for his condition of ALL. He incurred numerous out of pocket expenses in order to go into remission. Was it unethical for the insurance company to not pay for a treatment that ultimately worked but was not marketed or FDA cleared for his type of leukemia?

Herein, the EP4 receptor was evaluated as a potential therapeutic target for leukemia and lymphoma, whose survival depends on the constitutive activity of NF-kappaB. Utilizing a pharmacological approach, we proved that the EP4 receptor induces caspase-mediated apoptosis in malignantly transformed B cells, with the most prominent effect being on Burkitts lymphoma cells. Since the increased activation of NF-kappaB underlies multi-drug resistance phenomena, we modulated this signaling pathway via EP4 receptor triggering. Pge1-OH, a specific EP4 receptor agonist, led to decreased NF-kappaB activity and a consequent decrease in levels of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-xL in Ramos cells, resulting in an elevated sensitivity of cells towards bortezomib- and doxorubicin-induced chemotherapeutic effects. Our study identifies the as yet unrecognized potential of EP4 receptor agonists as chemo-sensitizing agents in B-cell lymphoma. The specific downregulation of NF-kappaB-dependent pathways in B-cell malignancies opens new possibilities for treatment and current therapy optimization using specific EP4 receptor agonists.","['Gobec, Martina', 'Prijatelj, Matevz', 'Delic, Jozo', 'Markovic, Tijana', 'Mlinaric-Rascan, Irena']","['Gobec M', 'Prijatelj M', 'Delic J', 'Markovic T', 'Mlinaric-Rascan I']","['University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Pharmacy, Askerceva cesta 7, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Pharmacy, Askerceva cesta 7, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', ""Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA), 18 route du Panorama, 92265 Fontenay-aux-Roses cedex, France."", 'University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Pharmacy, Askerceva cesta 7, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Pharmacy, Askerceva cesta 7, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Consequently, the incubation of HUVECs with CRC-MVs promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities of these cells.

These results suggest that colorectal cancer cells secreted MVs to contribute to tumor angiogenesis.","['Yamada, Nami', 'Tsujimura, Nonoka', 'Kumazaki, Minami', 'Shinohara, Haruka', 'Taniguchi, Kohei', 'Nakagawa, Yoshihito', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Yamada N', 'Tsujimura N', 'Kumazaki M', 'Shinohara H', 'Taniguchi K', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Naoe T', 'Akao Y']","['United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 yanagido, Gifu-city, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.

The expression, and to a greater extent the regulation of TLR4 and its auxiliary proteins (myeloid differentiation protein 1 (MD1), myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14)), are both poorly understood in trigeminal and nodose neurons. We used a combination of Western blotting, semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pharmacological manipulation and immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern and regulation by LPS and trophic factors of TLR4/MD2/CD14 and radioprotective protein of 105kDa (RP105)/MD1 were determined in neonatal trigeminal and nodose mice neurons. We found that all these proteins were expressed in both trigeminal and nodose neurons. The trophic factors Artemin and nerve growth factor (NGF) up-regulated MD2 and RP105 mRNA levels in trigeminal neurons. In nodose neurons the trophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) up-regulated MD1 and RP105 mRNA levels. Also we observed that in both neuronal types LPS acutely (within 20 min) down-regulated CD14 and MD2 mRNAs. In addition, LPS increased significantly the proportion of trigeminal and nodose neurons expressing nociceptin/orphanin FQ in culture probably acting via TLR4/MD2. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation by trophic factors and LPS require further elucidation, the findings of this study indicate that LPS acts through its archetypical receptor in trigeminal and nodose neurons.","['Kunda, P E', 'Cavicchia, J C', 'Acosta, C G']","['Kunda PE', 'Cavicchia JC', 'Acosta CG']","['Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Salud (INICSA), Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, 5000 Cordoba, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, 5500 Mendoza, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, 5500 Mendoza, Argentina.

Acute leukaemia is a rapidly fatal cancer potentially causing death within a few weeks, if untreated. Leukaemia arises as a result of disruption to haematopoietic precursors, caused either by acquired gene fusions, gene mutations or inappropriate expression of the relevant oncogenes. Current treatment options have made significant progress, but the 5 year survival for acute leukaemia remains under 10% in elderly patients, and less than 50% for some types of acute leukaemia in younger adults. For chronic leukaemias longer survival is generally expected and for chronic myeloid leukaemia patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors the median survival is not yet reached and is expected to exceed 10 years. Chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute leukaemia provide the mainstay of therapy for patients under 65 and both carry significant morbidity and mortality. Alternative and superior therapeutic strategies for acute leukaemias are urgently required. Recent molecular-based knowledge of recurring chromosome rearrangements, in particular translocations and inversions, has resulted in significant advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of leukaemia. Identification of a number of unique fusion genes has facilitated the development of highly specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Although delivery of siRNA using multifunctional nanoparticles has been investigated to treat solid cancers, the application of this approach to blood cancers is at an early stage. This review describes current treatments for leukaemia and highlights the potential of leukaemic fusion genes as therapeutic targets for RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, the design of biomimetic nanoparticles which are capable of responding to the physiological environment of leukaemia and their potential to advance RNAi therapeutics to the clinic will be critically evaluated.","['Guo, Jianfeng', 'Cahill, Mary R', 'McKenna, Sharon L', ""O'Driscoll, Caitriona M""]","['Guo J', 'Cahill MR', 'McKenna SL', ""O'Driscoll CM""]","['Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Cork University Hospital, Ireland.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Ireland.', 'Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork, Ireland.

These JNKi-induced apoptotic events were abrogated by Bcl-2 overexpression, whereas G2/M arrest, cyclin B1 up-regulation, Cdk1 activation, and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins were sustained. In the concomitant presence of the G1/S blocking agent aphidicolin and JNKi, the cells underwent G1/S arrest and failed to induce all apoptotic events. The JNKi-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins and mitochondrial apoptotic events were suppressed by the Cdk1 inhibitor. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that mitotic spindle defect and prometaphase arrest were the underlying factors for the G2/M arrest. These results demonstrate that JNKi-induced mitochondrial apoptosis was caused by microtubule damage-mediated prometaphase arrest, prolonged Cdk1 activation, and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins in Jurkat T cells.","['Jang, Won Young', 'Lee, Ji Young', 'Lee, Seung Tae', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Jang WY', 'Lee JY', 'Lee ST', 'Jun do Y', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute of Life Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.

Traditional risk factors for future RS include clinical (advanced Rai stage), biological (ZAP-70, CD38, CD49d) and genetic (del17p, del11q) characteristics at the time of CLL diagnosis. The impact of CLL therapy (purine-nucleoside analogue and/or alkylator-based chemoimmunotherapy and kinase inhibitor therapy) on the risk of RS remains controversial. Both heritable (germline) and acquired (somatic) genetic mutations contribute to risk of RS. Germline polymorphisms in genes related to CD38, LRF4, and BCL-2 have been implicated in the development of RS. Somatic mutations contributing to the development of RS include TP53 disruption, c-myc activation, CDKN2A loss and NOTCH1 mutations.

The clinical course, treatment and outcome are described. A systematic, meticulous and comprehensive analysis of existing publications regarding chronic lymphocytic leukemia with central nervous system involvement was performed. CONCLUSION: We concluded that central nervous system involvement of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is probably not associated with any evident risk factors. Diagnostic approach differs by institutions but often includes imaging, morphology and flow cytometry. Resolution of central nervous system symptoms can usually be accomplished with intrathecal chemotherapy or irradiation followed by systemic treatment. The recognition of this entity by clinicians could lead to early detection and treatment, resulting in better outcomes in this rare complication.","['de Souza, Simone Lima', 'Santiago, Fabio', 'Ribeiro-Carvalho, Marilza de Moura', 'Arnobio, Adriano', 'Soares, Andrea Ribeiro', 'Ornellas, Maria Helena']","['de Souza SL', 'Santiago F', 'Ribeiro-Carvalho Mde M', 'Arnobio A', 'Soares AR', 'Ornellas MH']","['Departamento de Patologia, Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Programa de Pos Graduacao em Ciencias Medicas, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, 444/4 degrees andar, Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. mariahelenaornellas@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140913,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Middle Aged']",,,2014/09/15 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2014/09/15 06:00'],"['2014/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-0500-7-645 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-7-645 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2014 Sep 13;7:645. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-7-645.,,,PMC4246480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Analyzing microchimerisms from patients microtransplanted to determine the presence of GSTT1, GSTM1, SRY and other genetic markers by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Microchimerism could be detected for a short time after microtransplantation simultaneously with hematopoietic recovery. In conclusion, microchimerism might accelerate hematopoietic recovery and GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes could be used as genetic markers to differentiate donor cells. DISCUSSION: Microchimerism could exist for a short time after microtransplantation and appears to function in hematopoietic recovery. According to published reports, cytokines secreted from microchimerisms could be detected in recipients and exhibit some function on the host. Therefore, cytokines secreted from donor cells are hypothesized to accelerate hematopoietic recovery. The evidence to prove a longer existence for microchimerism is insufficient and needs supports by additional experiments; however, we cannot deny its existence just because of the limited sensitivity of methods.","['Sun, Xuedong', 'Guo, Mei', 'Sun, Qiyun', 'Li, Bingxia', 'Sun, Yujing', 'Yao, Bo', 'Liu, Zhiqing', 'Liu, Tieqiang', 'Sang, Jianli', 'Ai, Huisheng']","['Sun X', 'Guo M', 'Sun Q', 'Li B', 'Sun Y', 'Yao B', 'Liu Z', 'Liu T', 'Sang J', 'Ai H']","['Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, 19, Xinjiekou Outer Street, Haidian District, Beijing 100875, PR China; Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, 8, Dongda Street, Fengtai District, Beijing 100071 PR China.

However, the emergence of IM resistance, commonly associated with point mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain, remains a major clinical problem. Here, we investigated the effects of E35, a novel derivative of emodin, on the IM-resistant 32Dp210-T315I cells. METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony formation assay. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by DNA fragmentation assay and annexin V/PI staining assay. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to access the BCR-ABL gene expression. Changes of related signaling molecules were detected through Western blot. RESULTS: E35 was found to potently inhibit proliferation of 32Dp210-T315I cells with an average IC50 of 2.4 microM at 48 h. Colony formation was almost fully suppressed in 1.0 muM E35 group. DNA fragmentation and annexin V/PI staining assay exhibited the typical DNA fragmentation and the increased proportion of early apoptotic cells, respectively. The induction of apoptosis was associated with increase of Bax to Bcl-2 expression ratio and activation of caspase cascades involving decrease of pro-caspase 9 and pro-caspase 3 and increase of PARP cleavage. The protein expression of P210(BCR-ABL) and p-P210(BCR-ABL) was down-regulated in the presence of E35, although the mRNA levels remained almost unchanged. Moreover, the activation of the P210(BCR-ABL) downstream signaling pathways including CrkL, Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK was fully suppressed by E35. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that E35 might be a potential antileukemia agent against IM resistance in CML.","['Li, Jing', 'Chen, Yingyu', 'Chen, Buyuan', 'Chen, Cai', 'Qiu, Binglin', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Zheng, Jing', 'Liu, Tingbo', 'Wang, Wenfeng', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Li J', 'Chen Y', 'Chen B', 'Chen C', 'Qiu B', 'Zheng Z', 'Zheng J', 'Liu T', 'Wang W', 'Hu J']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140914,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Emodin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/09/15 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/09/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1820-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Feb;141(2):283-93. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1820-2.

Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal myeloid disorders with a high prevalence of JAK2V617F mutation, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia through accumulation of additional mutations is a major complication in MPNs. Here, we showed that JAK2V617F(+) cells conferred paracrine DNA damage to neighboring normal cells as well as to themselves through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). We screened candidate factors responsible for the effect and found that lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) is overexpressed in JAK2V617F(+) cells and that short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Lcn2 significantly alleviated the paracrine DNA damage. Normal hematopoietic cells showed elevated ROS levels through increased intracellular iron levels when treated with lipocalin-2, which led to p53 pathway activation, increased apoptosis, and decreased cellular proliferation. In contrast, JAK2V617F(+) cells did not suffer from lipocalin-2-induced growth suppression resulting from attenuated p53 pathway activation, which conferred a relative growth advantage to JAK2V617F(+) clones. In summary, we demonstrated that JAK2V617F-harboring cells cause paracrine DNA damage accumulation through secretion of lipocalin-2, which gives proliferative advantage to themselves and an increased risk for leukemic transformation to both JAK2V617F(+) and JAK2V617F(-) clones.","['Kagoya, Yuki', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Tsuruta-Kishino, Takako', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Satoh, Takashi', 'Akira, Shizuo', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Kagoya Y', 'Yoshimi A', 'Tsuruta-Kishino T', 'Arai S', 'Satoh T', 'Akira S', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, World Premier International Research Center Initiative, Immunology Frontier Research Center, and Department of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, World Premier International Research Center Initiative, Immunology Frontier Research Center, and Department of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '126469-30-5 (Lcn2 protein, mouse)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Iron Overload/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/09/14 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35414-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-570572 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 6;124(19):2996-3006. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-570572.

We conducted a phase I study to investigate the effects of dinaciclib when administered with rituximab. METHODS: In this phase I nonrandomized dose-escalation 3 + 3 trial, patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were treated with dinaciclib and rituximab. Dinaciclib was administered intravenously (IV) over 2 h on days 1, 8 and 15 in cycles 2-13 (28-day cycles). Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was administered IV on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in cycle 1 (28-day cycle) and on day 1 during cycle 3-13. Rituximab was not administered in cycle 2. Rituximab and dinaciclib were given alone in cycles 1 and 2, respectively, and in combination in cycles 3-13. Primary objectives included determination of the recommended phase II dose of dinaciclib and evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered with rituximab. RESULTS: Five patients completed the study due to early termination. All presented with drug-related adverse events (AEs), but no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most commonly observed toxicities included hematological, digestive and metabolic AEs. However, no tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in the study. Four patients achieved stable disease, and one patient achieved complete response according to 2008 iwCLL criteria at cycle 3. PK samples were collected from 5 patients, and no obvious interaction between dinaciclib and rituximab was observed.

A total of 115 consecutive pediatric patients received unrelated CBT (n = 90) or sibling allo-PBSCT/BMT (n = 25) between 2000 and 2012. Neutrophil and platelet recovery were significantly delayed after CBT compared to allo-PBSCT/BMT. There was no difference in the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD between the two groups. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the CBT group than in the allo-PBSCT/BMT group (32.5 vs 12.8 %) (p = 0.03). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 13.1 % after CBT, which was significantly lower than that of after allo-PBSCT/BMT (45.3 %) (p = 0.015). The overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in the CBT group were similar to those of the allo-PBSCT/BMT group; however, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the 5-year LFS in the CBT group was slightly better than the allo-PBSCT/BMT group (55.7 % for CBT and 32.7 % for allo-PBSCT/BMT) (p = 0.08). Our comparisons suggest that for high-risk or advanced childhood acute leukemia, unrelated CBT has a higher TRM and similar long-term survival, but better antileukemia effect than HLA-matched sibling PBSCT/BMT. New strategies and better supportive care are required to decrease the TRM of CBT.","['Zheng, Changcheng', 'Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Yao, Wen', 'Song, Kaidi', 'Tong, Juan', 'Geng, Liangquan', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zheng C', 'Zhu X', 'Tang B', 'Yao W', 'Song K', 'Tong J', 'Geng L', 'Liu H', 'Sun Z']","['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140913,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Siblings', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,2014/09/14 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2213-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Mar;94(3):473-80. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2213-y.

While DEK has been identified as one of the most abundant proteins in human chromatin, its function and binding properties are not fully understood. METHODS: We performed ChIP-seq analysis in the myeloid cell line U937 and coupled it with epigenetic and gene expression analysis to explore the genome-wide binding pattern of DEK and its role in gene regulation. RESULTS: We show that DEK preferentially binds to open chromatin, with a low degree of DNA methylation and scarce in the heterochromatin marker H3K9me(3) but rich in the euchromatin marks H3K4me(2/3), H3K27ac and H3K9ac. More specifically, DEK binding is predominantly located at the transcription start sites of highly transcribed genes and a comparative analysis with previously established transcription factor binding patterns shows a similarity with that of RNA polymerase II. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrates that DEK mainly binds to genes that are ubiquitously expressed across tissues. The functional significance of DEK binding was demonstrated by knockdown of DEK by shRNA, resulting in both significant upregulation and downregulation of DEK-bound genes. CONCLUSIONS: We find that DEK binds to transcription start sites with a dual role in activation and repression of highly and ubiquitously expressed genes.","['Sanden, Carl', 'Jarvstrat, Linnea', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Brattas, Per Ludvik', 'Nilsson, Bjorn', 'Gullberg, Urban']","['Sanden C', 'Jarvstrat L', 'Lennartsson A', 'Brattas PL', 'Nilsson B', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Hematology, Lund University, BMC B13, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden. carl.sanden@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome, Human', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,2014/09/14 06:00,2016/05/07 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-215 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-215 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Sep 12;13:215. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-215.,,,PMC4175287,,,['GEO/GSE60734'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleoside analog cytarabine (ara-C) is the key agent for treating AML; however, up to 30 % of patients fail to respond to treatment. Screening of patient blood samples to determine drug response before commencement of treatment is needed. To achieve this aim, a self-bioluminescent reporter strain of Escherichia coli has been constructed and evaluated for use as an ara-C biosensor and an in vitro assay has been designed to predict ara-C response in clinical samples. Transposition mutagenesis was used to create a cytidine deaminase (cdd)-deficient mutant of E. coli MG1655 that responded to ara-C. The strain was transformed with the luxCDABE operon and used as a whole-cell biosensor for development an 8-h assay to determine ara-C uptake and phosphorylation by leukemic cells. Intracellular concentrations of 0.025 mumol/L phosphorylated ara-C were detected by significantly increased light output (P < 0.05) from the bacterial biosensor. Results using AML cell lines with known response to ara-C showed close correlation between the 8-h assay and a 3-day cytotoxicity test for ara-C cell killing. In retrospective tests with 24 clinical samples of bone marrow or peripheral blood, the biosensor-based assay predicted leukemic cell response to ara-C within 8 h. The biosensor-based assay may offer a predictor for evaluating the sensitivity of leukemic cells to ara-C before patients undergo chemotherapy and allow customized treatment of drug-sensitive patients with reduced ara-C dose levels. The 8-h assay monitors intracellular ara-CTP (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate) levels and, if fully validated, may be suitable for use in clinical settings.","['Anderson, Elizabeth', 'Salisbury, Vyv']","['Anderson E', 'Salisbury V']","['Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol,Advances in biochemical engineering/biotechnology,8307733,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.14.14.3 (Luciferases, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*analysis/metabolism', '*Biological Assay', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Limit of Detection', 'Luciferases, Bacterial/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Operon', 'Phosphorylation']",,,2014/09/14 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-662-43619-6_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol. 2014;145:189-214. doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-43619-6_6.,,"['II-3A-0409-10019/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'MR/J005207/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is recently reported that thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box factor (TOX) serves as a molecular marker for histological diagnosis of early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF). To examine whether TOX could be a marker of tumour cells in different types of cutaneous lymphoma, we investigated immunohistochemical staining for TOX with the lesional skin of patch, plaque, and tumour MF, Sezary syndrome (SS), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), atopic dermatitis (AD), and normal skin. TOX and CCR4 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in lesional skin of MF/SS were also examined. Immunohistological staining showed that a high specific nuclear staining of TOX was observed at a high frequency in MF, SS, and PTCL, NOS. Tumour cells in LyP, PCALCL, and ATLL showed a slightly dim nuclear staining of TOX. TOX(+) cells in MF and LyP expressed surface molecules characteristics of tumour cells in these diseases. Lesional skin of SS expressed higher levels of TOX mRNA, compared to normal skin or MF lesional skin. Moreover, TOX expression significantly correlated with CCR4 expression. TOX may be a specific marker for tumour cells in some types of cutaneous lymphoma.","['Morimura, Sohshi', 'Sugaya, Makoto', 'Suga, Hiraku', 'Miyagaki, Tomomitsu', 'Ohmatsu, Hanako', 'Fujita, Hideki', 'Asano, Yoshihide', 'Tada, Yayoi', 'Kadono, Takafumi', 'Sato, Shinichi']","['Morimura S', 'Sugaya M', 'Suga H', 'Miyagaki T', 'Ohmatsu H', 'Fujita H', 'Asano Y', 'Tada Y', 'Kadono T', 'Sato S']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140913,Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL17 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (TOX protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Biopsy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Chemokine CCL17/analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/chemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*chemistry/classification/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CCR4/analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sezary Syndrome/chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemistry/classification/genetics/pathology']",,,2014/09/14 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00403-014-1501-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 2014 Nov;306(9):843-9. doi: 10.1007/s00403-014-1501-7.

The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene transcripts, their interrelationship and impact on the outcome in pediatric AML patients. METHODS: We assessed proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene transcripts by Q-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan probe) in 64 consecutive pediatric AML patients. Survival data was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves followed by log rank test to compare statistical significance between groups. Stepwise multivariable Cox regression method was used to evaluate independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, transcript ratio of FLT3/BCL2 and FLT3+KIT/BCL2 significantly predicted event free survival (EFS) (<0.01 and <0.01 respectively) and overall survival (OS) (<0.01 and<0.01 respectively). In stepwise Cox-regression model, high white blood cell count and high FLT3+KIT/BCL2 ratio predicted EFS (HR: 2.2 and 2.3); high hemoglobin and high FLT3+KIT/BCL2 ratio predicted OS (HR: 0.45 and 3.85). Prognostic index (PI) was calculated using the hazard coefficient of independent prognostic factors; at 57.3 months, predicted OS of patients with the highest PI of 1.8 was 8% versus 73% for the lowest PI of -0.3. The mean PI of patients who died was 1.8+/-0.72 versus 0.54+/-0.70 for those who are alive, P=0.004. CONCLUSIONS: This first study showed that individual expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic transcripts is not as important in AML patients, rather their interrelationship and relative level probably determines the outcome.","['Sharawat, Surender Kumar', 'Bakhshi, Radhika', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Sharawat SK', 'Bakhshi R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.

We investigated a potential cluster of hospital-based Herbaspirillum species infections. METHODS: Cases were defined as Herbaspirillum species isolated from a patient in our comprehensive cancer center between 1 January 2006 and 15 October 2013. Case finding was performed by reviewing isolates initially identified as Burkholderia cepacia susceptible to all antibiotics tested, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of available isolates to confirm their identity. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to test genetic relatedness. Facility observations, infection prevention assessments, and environmental sampling were performed to investigate potential sources of Herbaspirillum species. RESULTS: Eight cases of Herbaspirillum species were identified. Isolates from the first 5 clustered cases were initially misidentified as B. cepacia, and available isolates from 4 of these cases were indistinguishable. The 3 subsequent cases were identified by prospective surveillance and had different PFGE patterns. All but 1 case-patient had bloodstream infections, and 6 presented with sepsis. Underlying diagnoses included solid tumors (3), leukemia (3), lymphoma (1), and aplastic anemia (1). Herbaspirillum species infections were hospital-onset in 5 patients and community-onset in 3. All symptomatic patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics, and their infections resolved. No environmental source or common mechanism of acquisition was identified. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a hospital-based cluster of Herbaspirillum species infections. Herbaspirillum species are capable of causing bacteremia and sepsis in immunocompromised patients. Herbaspirillum species can be misidentified as Burkholderia cepacia by commercially available microbial identification systems.","['Chemaly, Roy F', 'Dantes, Raymund', 'Shah, Dimpy P', 'Shah, Pankil K', 'Pascoe, Neil', 'Ariza-Heredia, Ella', 'Perego, Cheryl', 'Nguyen, Duc B', 'Nguyen, Kim', 'Modarai, Farhad', 'Moulton-Meissner, Heather', 'Noble-Wang, Judith', 'Tarrand, Jeffrey J', 'LiPuma, John J', 'Guh, Alice Y', 'MacCannell, Tara', 'Raad, Issam', 'Mulanovich, Victor']","['Chemaly RF', 'Dantes R', 'Shah DP', 'Shah PK', 'Pascoe N', 'Ariza-Heredia E', 'Perego C', 'Nguyen DB', 'Nguyen K', 'Modarai F', 'Moulton-Meissner H', 'Noble-Wang J', 'Tarrand JJ', 'LiPuma JJ', 'Guh AY', 'MacCannell T', 'Raad I', 'Mulanovich V']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Epidemic Intelligence Service, Scientific Education and Professional Development Program Office Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'The University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston.', 'Texas Department of State Health Services, Austin.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Epidemic Intelligence Service, Scientific Education and Professional Development Program Office Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Betaproteobacteria', 'Burkholderia cepacia', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal/chemistry/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Herbaspirillum/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Typing', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",['NOTNLM'],"['Herbaspirillum', 'cancer', 'immunocompromised', 'misdiagnosis', 'outbreak']",2014/09/14 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ciu712 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciu712 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2015 Jan 1;60(1):48-54. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciu712.

In recent years, several second-generation inhibitors - such as dasatinib and nilotinib - have become available: these promise to overcome some of the mutations associated with acquired resistance to imatinib. Despite eliciting similar clinical responses, the molecular effects of these agents on different subpopulations of leukemic cells remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, the consequences of using high-dose imatinib therapy have not been investigated in detail. Here we utilized clinical data from patients treated with dasatinib, nilotinib, or high-dose imatinib, together with a statistical data analysis and mathematical modeling approach, to investigate the molecular treatment response of leukemic cells to these agents. We found that these drugs elicit very similar responses if administered front-line. However, patients display significantly different kinetics when treated second-line, both in terms of differences between front-line and second-line treatment for the same drug, and among agents when used as second-line. We then utilized a mathematical framework describing the behavior of four differentiation levels of leukemic cells during therapy to predict the treatment response kinetics for the different cohorts of patients. The dynamics of BCR-ABL1 clearance observed in our study suggest that the use of standard or high-dose imatinib or a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as nilotinib or dasatinib elicits similar responses when administered as front-line therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.","['Olshen, Adam', 'Tang, Min', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Branford, Susan', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Michor, Franziska']","['Olshen A', 'Tang M', 'Cortes J', 'Gonen M', 'Hughes T', 'Branford S', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Michor F']","['University of California at San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, USA.', 'M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, and University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, and University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, USA michor@jimmy.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140912,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/14 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/09/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.085977 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.085977 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Nov;99(11):1701-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.085977.

Here we investigated derivatives of apoptin, a chicken anemia viral protein with selective toxicity towards cancer cells, which can be directed towards inhibiting multiple hyperactive kinases including BCR-ABL1. Our earlier studies revealed that a proline-rich segment of apoptin interacts with the SH3 domain of fusion protein BCR-ABL1 (p210) and acts as a negative regulator of BCR-ABL1 kinase and its downstream targets. In this study we show for the first time, the therapeutic potential of apoptin-derived decapeptide for the treatment of CML by establishing the minimal region of apoptin interaction domain with BCR-ABL1. We further show that the apoptin decapeptide is able to inhibit BCR-ABL1 down stream target c-Myc with a comparable efficacy to full-length apoptin and Imatinib. The synthetic apoptin is able to inhibit cell proliferation in murine (32Dp210), human cell line (K562), and ex vivo in both imatinib-resistant and imatinib sensitive CML patient samples. The apoptin based single or combination therapy may be an additional option in CML treatment and eventually be feasible as curative therapy.","['Jangamreddy, Jaganmohan R', 'Panigrahi, Soumya', 'Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Yadav, Manisha', 'Maddika, Subbareddy', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Sanyal, Sabyasachi', 'Los, Marek J']","['Jangamreddy JR', 'Panigrahi S', 'Lotfi K', 'Yadav M', 'Maddika S', 'Tripathi AK', 'Sanyal S', 'Los MJ']","['Dept.

The MYD88 L265P mutation has been recently identified in >90% of bone-marrow-based lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, but the incidence of this abnormality and corresponding morphologic correlates in nodal lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma have not been established. We analyzed 87 cases of extramedullary lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, unclassifiable splenic B-cell lymphomas, nodal marginal zone lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation for MYD88 L265P. Eighteen cases (21%) were positive, including 9/9 (100%) lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas with classic histologic features, 5/12 (42%) cases that met 2008 WHO criteria for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma but with atypical morphologic features, 3/15 (20%) cases initially considered nodal marginal zone lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, and 1/6 (17%) unclassifiable splenic B-cell lymphomas. The presence of MYD88 L265P was associated with IgM paraprotein (P<0.001) and a trend for bone marrow involvement (P=0.09). Each of 44 splenectomy-defined splenic marginal zone lymphomas (19 with plasmacytic differentiation) and the chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation were negative for the mutation. Morphologic re-review with knowledge of MYD88 mutation status and all available clinical features suggested all MYD88 mutated cases were consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (either classic or variant histology), except for one case which remained most consistent with nodal marginal zone lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation. These results demonstrate the importance of MYD88 mutational analysis in better defining lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma as a relatively monomorphic small B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation that may show total nodal architectural effacement and follicular colonization. Cases previously considered lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma that are more polymorphous and are often associated with histiocytes should no longer be included in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma category. Clinicopathologic review suggests that although MYD88 mutated non-lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma small B-cell neoplasms exist, they are very uncommon.","['Hamadeh, Fatima', 'MacNamara, Stephen P', 'Aguilera, Nadine S', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Cook, James R']","['Hamadeh F', 'MacNamara SP', 'Aguilera NS', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Cook JR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140912,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*genetics', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2014120 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2014.120 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2015 Apr;28(4):564-74. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2014.120.

Chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations have been shown to have essential roles in pathogenesis and correlate with prognosis. Molecular markers, however, are not integrated into currently used prognostic systems. The goal of this study is to identify plasma microRNAs useful for classification and risk stratification of myelodysplastic syndromes. We applied a novel, high-throughput digital quantification technology (NanoString) to profile microRNA expression in plasma samples of 72 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and 12 healthy individuals. We correlated these results with overall survival. In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a diploid karyotype, we identified and validated a 7-microRNA signature as an independent predictor of survival with a predictive power of 75% accuracy (P=0.008), better than those of the International Prognostic Scoring Systems and the MD Anderson Prognostic Lower Risk Prognostic Model. We also identified differentially expressed plasma microRNAs in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes versus healthy individuals and between patients with myelodysplastic syndromes associated with different cytogenetic features. These results validate the utility of circulating-microRNA levels as noninvasive biomarkers that can inform the management of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

Chronic occupational exposure to benzene is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This study investigates changes in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation in subjects occupationally exposed to a BTX. Blood DNA samples and exposure data were obtained from subjects with different levels of exposure, including 132 decorators, 129 painters, and 130 unexposed referents in a container-manufacturing factory in Shenzhen, China. Occupational exposure assessment included personal monitoring of airborne benzene, toluene and xylene. Hematological parameters were measured and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was used to detect DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2(MBD2). PARP1 assay was used to measure PARP activity. Airborne levels of benzene, toluene and xylene in the two exposed groups were significantly higher than those of controls (P<0.001). The two exposed groups (decorators, painters) showed decreased PARP1, DNMTs and MBD2 expression relative to controls (P<0.05), and PARP activity was also decreased (P<0.05). Decreased PARP1, DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b and MBD2 mRNA expression was correlated with increased airborne BTX (Pearson's r: -0.587, -0.314, -0.636, -0.567 and -0.592 respectively, P<0.001). No significant differences in hematological parameters and CBMN were found among the three groups. Together, these results suggest that decreased DNMTs, MBD2 and PARP1 might be involved in the global hypomethylation associated with BTX exposure, and the imbalance of PARP/PARG might participate in the down-regulation of DNMTs.

Ca(2+) is crucial for peripheral T-lymphocyte activation and effector functions, and influences thymocyte selection and motility in the developing thymus. However, the role of Ca(2+) signalling in early T-lymphocyte development is not well understood. Here we show that the inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) Ca(2+) ion channels are required for proliferation, survival and developmental progression of T-lymphocyte precursors. Our studies indicate that signalling via IP3Rs represses Sox13, an antagonist of the developmentally important transcription factor Tcf-1. In the absence of IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) signalling, repression of key Notch transcriptional targets--including Hes1--fail to occur in post beta-selection thymocytes, and mice develop aggressive T-cell malignancies that resemble human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). These data indicate that IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) signalling reinforces Tcf-1 activity to both ensure normal development and prevent thymocyte neoplasia.","['Ouyang, Kunfu', 'Leandro Gomez-Amaro, Rafael', 'Stachura, David L', 'Tang, Huayuan', 'Peng, Xiaohong', 'Fang, Xi', 'Traver, David', 'Evans, Sylvia M', 'Chen, Ju']","['Ouyang K', 'Leandro Gomez-Amaro R', 'Stachura DL', 'Tang H', 'Peng X', 'Fang X', 'Traver D', 'Evans SM', 'Chen J']","['1] Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA [2] Drug Discovery Center, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Drug Discovery Center, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Drug Discovery Center, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hnf1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Sox13 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Thymocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2015/10/31 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms5814 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms5814 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Sep 12;5:4814. doi: 10.1038/ncomms5814.,,"['K01 DK087814/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL107442/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 HL128773/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01-DK087814-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5537137,['NIHMS767808'],,['GEO/GSE57997'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By deleting enzymes that affect aerobic glycolysis with different potencies, we examine how modulating glucose metabolism specifically affects hematopoietic and leukemic cell populations. We find that a deficiency in the M2 pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM2) reduces the levels of metabolic intermediates important for biosynthesis and impairs progenitor function without perturbing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) deletion significantly inhibits the function of both HSCs and progenitors during hematopoiesis. In contrast, leukemia initiation by transforming alleles putatively affecting either HSCs or progenitors is inhibited in the absence of either PKM2 or LDHA, indicating that the cell-state-specific responses to metabolic manipulation in hematopoiesis do not apply to the setting of leukemia. This finding suggests that fine-tuning the level of glycolysis may be explored therapeutically for treating leukemia while preserving HSC function.","['Wang, Ying-Hua', 'Israelsen, William J', 'Lee, Dongjun', 'Yu, Vionnie W C', 'Jeanson, Nathaniel T', 'Clish, Clary B', 'Cantley, Lewis C', 'Vander Heiden, Matthew G', 'Scadden, David T']","['Wang YH', 'Israelsen WJ', 'Lee D', 'Yu VWC', 'Jeanson NT', 'Clish CB', 'Cantley LC', 'Vander Heiden MG', 'Scadden DT']","['Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Metabolite Profiling Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

B-cell lymphoma/Leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) can inhibit apoptosis in a wide variety of cells including neurons. In this experiment, by studying Bcl-2 over-expression transgenic (TG) mice subjected to spinal cord injury (SCI), we investigated whether Bcl-2 could reduce posttraumatic neuronal apoptosis, reduce the range of damage, and improve the behavioral functional recovery after contusive SCI. METHODS: Nine Bcl-2 TG mice and nine control mice were subjected to SCI of moderate severity at T10, with the use of weight dropping (WD) method (impact force 2.5x3.0 g/cm). At times up to 1 day, 7 days and 14 days after SCI, functional deficits were evaluated with Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scales, and apoptosis of neurons was investigated by using the TUNEL method. Another three control mice only underwent lamina opening, but were not subjected to SCI, to provide blank comparison. RESULTS: The mean functional scores for the control mice (5.05 +/-0.35) were lower than those for the Bcl-2 TG mice (5.45 +/-0.15), although the unpaired T-test revealed no significant difference (P=0.67). On the other hand, the number of TUNEL positive neurons and integrated option density (IOD) scores for the Bcl-2 TG mice were both significantly lower than those for the control mice (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This experiment suggests that overexpression of Bcl-2 may suppress neuronal apoptosis after SCI. Bcl-2 may be an important factor within the central nervous system that can relieve the damage after trauma.","['Wang, Ying', 'Sun, Zhi-Yang', 'Zhang, Kui-Ming', 'Xu, Guo-Qiang', 'Li, Guang']","['Wang Y', 'Sun ZY', 'Zhang KM', 'Xu GQ', 'Li G']","['Department of Emergency Medicine (Wang Y, Xu GQ, Li G), Department of Neurosurgery (Sun ZY, Zhang KM), Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine (Wang Y, Xu GQ, Li G), Department of Neurosurgery (Sun ZY, Zhang KM), Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine (Wang Y, Xu GQ, Li G), Department of Neurosurgery (Sun ZY, Zhang KM), Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine (Wang Y, Xu GQ, Li G), Department of Neurosurgery (Sun ZY, Zhang KM), Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine (Wang Y, Xu GQ, Li G), Department of Neurosurgery (Sun ZY, Zhang KM), Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,World J Emerg Med,World journal of emergency medicine,101549691,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis of neurons', 'Bcl-2', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Transgenic mouse', 'Weight dropping']",2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2010/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,World J Emerg Med. 2011;2(1):38-44.,,,PMC4129735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the program treats outpatients only, once-daily administration of IV antibiotics is desirable. A high-dose, once-daily vancomycin nomogram was developed and implemented as part of the antibiotic treatment regimen. OBJECTIVE: To determine if therapeutic vancomycin trough levels could be achieved with a high-dose, once-daily regimen in this outpatient setting. METHODS: A prospective, single-centre, observational cohort study was conducted over a 7-month period. Outpatients in the Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program were started on IV vancomycin with the high-dose, once-daily vancomycin nomogram, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Of 48 outpatients treated over the 7-month period, 10 (21%) had therapeutic vancomycin trough concentrations (i.e., greater than 10 mg/L). Thirty-five (90%) of the 39 patients with suspected clinical infection experienced clinical cure, and 6 (67%) of the 9 patients with documented microbiological infection experienced microbiological cure. Thirty (62%) of the 48 patients experienced symptoms of ""red man syndrome"", and 7 (15%) experienced some degree of nephrotoxicity. Two of 3 patients with laboratory-reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for identified pathogens had a calculated area under the curve to MIC ratio greater than or equal to 400. CONCLUSION: The high-dose, once-daily vancomycin nomogram was effective in attaining trough levels greater than 10 mg/L in only 21% of patients in this study. A substantial number of adverse drug reactions were observed. Given these results, high-dose, once-daily vancomycin is no longer recommended for outpatient therapy.","['Luo, Cindy', 'Hussaini, Trana', 'Lacaria, Katie', 'Yeung, Janice', 'Lau, Tim T Y', 'Broady, Raewyn C']","['Luo C', 'Hussaini T', 'Lacaria K', 'Yeung J', 'Lau TT', 'Broady RC']","['BSc(Pharm), ACPR, is a Clinical Pharmacist at Vancouver General Hospital and a Clinical Instructor in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'BSc(Pharm), ACPR, PharmD, is a Pharmacotherapeutic Specialist, Solid Organ Transplantation, Vancouver General Hospital, and a Clinical Instructor, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'BSc, BSc(Pharm), ACPR, is a Clinical Pharmacist, Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, and a Clinical Instructor, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'BSc(Pharm), ACPR, PharmD, is Coordinator, Lower Mainland Pharmacy Services Pharmacy Practice Residency Program; a Pharmacotherapeutic Specialist, Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital; and a Clinical Assistant Professor, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'PharmD, ACPR, FCSHP, is a Pharmacotherapeutic Specialist, Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Stewardship, Vancouver General Hospital, and is also a Clinical Professor, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and an Associate Member, Division of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'MBChB, FRACP, is Director, Ambulatory Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, and Clinical Associate Professor, Division of Hematology, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Canada,Can J Hosp Pharm,The Canadian journal of hospital pharmacy,0215645,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['febrile neutropenia', 'nomogram', 'once-daily vancomycin', 'therapeutic drug monitoring']",2014/09/13 06:00,2014/09/13 06:01,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4212/cjhp.v67i4.1372 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Hosp Pharm. 2014 Jul;67(4):280-5. doi: 10.4212/cjhp.v67i4.1372.,,,PMC4152967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 2008 to 2013, 90 patients underwent MSD-HSCT, 116 underwent URD-HSCT, and 99 underwent HRD-HSCT. HRDs were associated with higher incidences of grades 2 to 4 (42.4%) and severe acute graft-versus-host disease (17.2%) and nonrelapse mortality (30.5%), compared with MSDs (15.6%, 5.6%, and 4.7%, respectively; P < .05), but were similar to URDs, even fully 10/10 HLA-matched URDs. For high-risk patients, a superior graft-versus-leukemia effect was observed in HRD-HSCT, with 5-year relapse rates of 15.4% in HRD-HSCT, 28.2% in URD-HSCT (P = .07), and 49.9% in MSD-HSCT (P = .002).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort and review of literature. SETTING: Academic fertility preservation unit. PARTICIPANTS: Three girls diagnosed with Turner syndrome, 1 girl diagnosed with germ-cell tumor. and 1 girl diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of ovarian reserve, ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, in vitro maturation, and mature oocyte cryopreservation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Response to ovarian stimulation, number of mature oocytes cryopreserved and complications, if any. RESULTS: Mean anti-mullerian hormone, baseline follical stimulating hormone, estradiol, and antral follicle counts were 1.30 +/- 0.39, 6.08 +/- 2.63, 41.39 +/- 24.68, 8.0 +/- 3.2; respectively. In Turner girls the ovarian reserve assessment indicated already diminished ovarian reserve. Ovarian stimulation and oocyte cryopreservation was successfully performed in all female children referred for fertility preservation. A range of 4-11 mature oocytes (mean 8.1 +/- 3.4) was cryopreserved without any complications. All girls tolerated the procedure well. CONCLUSIONS: Oocyte cryopreservation is a feasible technique in selected female children at risk for premature ovarian failure. Further studies would be beneficial to test the success of oocyte cryopreservation in young girls.","['Oktay, K', 'Bedoschi, G']","['Oktay K', 'Bedoschi G']","['Innovation Institute for Fertility Preservation and IVF, New York, NY; Laboratory of Molecular Reproduction and Fertility Preservation, Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.

To disclose this point, we measured the intracellular ATP and GTP levels among K562 cells exposed to a single dose of 3-HK (7, 12 and 25nM). The HPLC analyses of the 3-HK-treated cell lysates indicated a dose-dependent reduction in both GTP and ATP levels. The reduction of purine nucleotide levels was also associated with decreased activity of adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) and enhanced level of cell death through apoptosis. However, the inhibitory effect of 3-HK was reversed by exogenous addition of guanosine with respect to GTP and partially with respect to ATP level. These data suggest that 3-HK targets a delicate regulatory system which governs the life/death fate of the cells partially through modulation of the GTP/ATP pool sizes.","['Nouri, Kazem', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh']","['Nouri K', 'Yazdanparast R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, P.O.

While overall survival rates of >70% are reported from developed countries, survival is much less likely in developing countries and unknown in many countries in Africa. OBJECTIVE: To analyse survival rates of childhood cancers in two South African paediatric oncology units. METHODS: This retrospective review included all children (0 - 15 years) admitted with a malignancy at two paediatric oncology units (Universitas Hospital Academic Complex in Bloemfontein, Free State, and Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, Western Cape) between 1987 and 2011. The protocols used in the units were similar, and all the diagnoses were confirmed histologically. RESULTS: There were 3 241 children, 53.5% of whom were males. Median follow-up was 17 months. The most common cancers were leukaemia (25.0%), brain tumours (19.5%), lymphoma (13.0%) and nephroblastoma (10.0%). The prevalences of neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma were similar at 5.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Overall survival was calculated to be 52.1%. Lymphoma and nephroblastoma had the highest survival rates at 63.9% and 62.6%, respectively. Brain tumours had the lowest survival rate at 46.4%. A comparison between ethnic groups showed white children to have the highest survival rate (62.8%); the rate for children of mixed racial origin was 53.8% and that for black children 48.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival rates for children admitted to two paediatric cancer units in South Africa were lower than data published from developed countries, because many children presented with advanced disease. New strategies to improve cancer awareness are urgently required.","['Stones, David K', 'De Bruin, Gerhard P', 'Esterhuizen, Tonya M', 'Stefan, Daniela Cristina']","['Stones DK', 'De Bruin GP', 'Esterhuizen TM', 'Stefan DC']","['Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Universitas Academic Hospital Complex, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa. stonesDK@ufs.ac.za.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140519,South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Protocols', 'Child, Preschool', 'Delayed Diagnosis/adverse effects/prevention & control', 'Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/ethnology/therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7196/samj.7882 [doi]'],epublish,S Afr Med J. 2014 May 19;104(7):501-4. doi: 10.7196/samj.7882.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In thymocytes and T-cell leukemia, Ikaros negatively regulates transcription of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT), a key protein in lymphocyte differentiation. The signaling pathways that regulate Ikaros-mediated repression of TdT are unknown. Our previous work identified Casein Kinase II (CK2) and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) as regulators of Ikaros DNA binding activity. Here, we investigated the role of PP1 and CK2 in regulating Ikaros-mediated control of TdT expression. PROCEDURES: Ikaros phosphomimetic and phosphoresistant mutants and specific CK2 and PP1 inhibitors were used in combination with quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (q RT-PCR) assays to evaluate the role of CK2 and PP1 in regulating the ability of Ikaros to bind the TdT promoter and to regulate TdT expression. RESULTS: We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ikaros by pro-oncogenic CK2 decreases Ikaros binding to the promoter of the TdT gene and reduces the ability of Ikaros to repress TdT expression during thymocyte differentiation. CK2 inhibition and PP1 activity restore Ikaros DNA-binding affinity toward the TdT promoter, as well as Ikaros-mediated transcriptional repression of TdT in primary thymocytes and in leukemia. CONCLUSION: These data establish that PP1 and CK2 signal transduction pathways regulate Ikaros-mediated repression of TdT in thymocytes and leukemia. These findings reveal that PP1 and CK2 have opposing effects on Ikaros-mediated repression of TdT and establish novel roles for PP1 and CK2 signaling in thymocyte differentiation and leukemia.","['Wang, Haijun', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Gurel, Zafer', 'Song, Na', 'Ma, Jisheng', 'Ouyang, Hongsheng', 'Lai, Liangxue', 'Payne, Kimberly J', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Wang H', 'Song C', 'Gurel Z', 'Song N', 'Ma J', 'Ouyang H', 'Lai L', 'Payne KJ', 'Dovat S']","['School of Pharmacology, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania; College of Animal Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140911,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CK2', 'IKZF1', 'Ikaros', 'PP1', 'TdT', 'leukemia']",2014/09/13 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25221 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2230-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25221.

Since complex karyotypes frequently contain deletions of the chromosomal region 12p13 encompassing the tumor suppressor genes ETV6 and CDKN1B, we aimed to unravel their modes of inactivation in CK-AML. RESULTS: To decipher deletions, mutations and methylation of ETV6 and CDKN1B, arrayCGH, SNP arrays, direct sequencing of all coding exons and pyrosequencing of the 5'UTR CpG islands of ETV6 and CDKN1B were performed. In total, 39 of 79 patients (49%) showed monoallelic deletions of 12p13 according to karyotypic data and 20 of 43 patients (47%) according to genomic profiling. Genomic profiling led to the minimal deleted region covering the 3'-UTR of ETV6 and CDKN1B. Direct sequencing revealed one novel monoallelic frameshift mutation in ETV6 while no mutations in CDKN1B were identified. Furthermore, methylation levels of ETV6 and CDKN1B did not indicate transcriptional silencing of any of these genes. ETV6 and CDKN1B had reduced expression levels in CK-AML patients with deletion in 12p13 as compared to CK-AML without deletion in 12p13, while the other genes (BCL2L14, LRP6, DUSP16 and GPRC5D) located within the minimal deleted region in 12p13 had very low or missing expression in CK-AML irrespective of their copy number status. CONCLUSIONS: ETV6 and CDKN1B are mainly affected by small monoallelic deletions, whereas mutations and hypermethylation play a minor role in CK-AML. Reduced gene dosage led to reduced gene expression levels, pointing to haploinsufficiency as the relevant mechanism of inactivation of ETV6 and CDKN1B in CK-AML.","['Feurstein, Simone', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Hofmann, Winfried', 'Manukjan, Georgi', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Lehmann, Ulrich', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Steinemann, Doris']","['Feurstein S', 'Rucker FG', 'Bullinger L', 'Hofmann W', 'Manukjan G', 'Gohring G', 'Lehmann U', 'Heuser M', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner K', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Steinemann D']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

A total of 167 patients (age>/=65 years old) received all-trans retinoic acid + daunorubicin as induction therapy. Of these patients, 22 died before attaining complete remission; the remaining 145 subjects received MiDAC- or As2O3-based consolidation therapy. As2O3 was superior to MiDAC for improving DFS and OS. This benefit appeared to result from the longer 5-year DFS (92.0 vs. 69.1%, P<0.01) and OS (94.5 vs. 79.7%, P<0.05) of As2O3 compared to MiDAC. PCR monitoring demonstrated that As2O3 promoted a lower positive rate than MiDAC (21.7 vs. 4.5%, P<0.05), but this treatment had no advantage for maintaining a low positive rate in the high-risk group. The most common life-threatening adverse drug effects in patients with MiDAC were platelet counts<25x10(9)/L (85.7%), leukocyte counts<1.0x10(9)/L (81.4%) and severe infection (84.3%). In contrast, the As2O3 regimen rarely caused leukocyte counts<1.0x10(9)/L (22.7%, P<0.01), platelet counts<25x10(9)/L (37.3%, P<0.01) or severe infection (21.3%, P<0.01). These data confirm that MiDAC should not be added during the initial consolidation of patients with APL because this treatment is far less effective, particularly in patients with a low-risk profile, and far more toxic than As2O3.","['Huang, Bin-Tao', 'Zeng, Qing-Chun', 'Zhao, Wei-Hong', 'Li, Bing-Sheng', 'Chen, Rui-lin']","['Huang BT', 'Zeng QC', 'Zhao WH', 'Li BS', 'Chen RL']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 TongDao Avenue North, Hohhot, 010059, People's Republic of China, huangbintao1979@sina.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0233-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Oct;31(10):233. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0233-z.

The expression levels of miR-23a and BCR/ABL were assessed in 42 newly diagnosed CML patients, 37 CML patients in first complete remission and 25 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis and colony formation assay were used to evaluate changes induced by overexpression or inhibition of miR-23a or BCR/ABL. MiR-23a mimic or negative control mimic was transfected into a CML cell line (K562) and two lung cancer cell lines (H157 and SKMES1) using Lipofectamine 2000, and the cells were used for real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. We found that the downregulation of miR-23a expression was a frequent event in both leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells from patients with de novo CML. The microarray results showed that most of the CML patients expressed high levels of BCR/ABL and low levels of miR-23a. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the BCR/ABL levels in miR-23a-transfected cells were lower than those in the control groups. Ectopic expression of miR-23a in K562 cells led to cellular senescence. Moreover, when K562 cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, BCR/ABL expression was upregulated, which indicates epigenetic silencing of miR-23a in leukemic cells. BCR/ABL and miR-23a expressions were inversely related to CML, and BCR/ABL expression was regulated by miR-23a in leukemic cells. The epigenetic silencing of miR-23a led to derepression of BCR/ABL expression, and consequently contributes to CML development and progression.","['Xishan, Z', 'Xianjun, L', 'Ziying, L', 'Guangxin, C', 'Gang, L']","['Xishan Z', 'Xianjun L', 'Ziying L', 'Guangxin C', 'Gang L']","['Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, Guangdong province, China.', ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, P.R.

Factors, such as the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index, associated with transplant outcomes may help us design risk-stratification-directed intervention to improve the prognosis of leukemia patients. Preliminary results of novel protocols, including co-transplant of haploidentical allografts and cord blood, as well as human leukocyte antigen-mismatched stem cell microtransplantation, for leukemia have shown that these approaches are feasible. Several strategies for enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effects significantly decreased the relapse rate after haplo-SCT.

Recent evidence suggests that autophagy plays a potential role in cell death as a tumor suppressor and that its induction especially in combination with apoptosis could be beneficial. It remains unclear if all cancer cells behave the same mechanism when autophagy is induced. Although mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is well known as a negative regulator of autophagy, the relationship between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and autophagy has not yet been investigated. Oroxylin A, a natural mono-flavonoid extracted from Scutellariae radix, is a promising therapeutic agent for treating multiple cancers. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of oroxylin A on malignant glioma cells. We showed that oroxylin A inhibited the proliferation of malignant glioma cells by inducing autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Oroxylin A treatment inhibits the AKT and ERK activation and the downstream phosphorylation level of mTOR and STAT3. In addition, oroxylin A treatment decreases the expression of Notch-1 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) but upregulates Beclin 1, the key autophagy-related protein. 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) or knockdown of Beclin 1 partially can rescue cells from oroxylin A-induced autophagic cell death. In contrast, knockdown of STAT3 aggravates oroxylin A-induced autophagic cell death. Our data reveal an important role of autophagy in enhancing cell death induced by oroxylin A and conclude that oroxylin A exerts anti-malignant glioma proficiency by inducing autophagy via the ERK/AKT-mTOR-STAT3-Notch signaling cascade.","['Zou, Meijuan', 'Hu, Chen', 'You, Qidong', 'Zhang, Aixia', 'Wang, Xuerong', 'Guo, Qinglong']","['Zou M', 'Hu C', 'You Q', 'Zhang A', 'Wang X', 'Guo Q']","['Department of Pharmacology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Center for Pharmacodynamics Research and Evaluation, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140911,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '53K24Z586G (5,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['autophagy', 'cell death', 'mTOR-STAT3-Notch', 'malignant glioma cells', 'oroxylin A']",2014/09/13 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.22212 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2015 Nov;54(11):1363-75. doi: 10.1002/mc.22212.

Paclitaxel has long been recognized to induce mitotic arrest, which leads to cell death in a subset of the arrested population. However, recent evidence demonstrates that intratumoral concentrations of paclitaxel are too low to cause mitotic arrest and result in multipolar divisions instead.

Treatment is often initiated when symptoms affect HRQL, and patients can experience many rounds of treatment throughout their life. Therefore, the economic burden of CLL can be high. Utility or preference weights for health states reflect the value of HRQL of a given health state and range from 1 (full health) to 0 (dead) and below (negative values possible). Nine health states were developed representing different CLL treatment lines or disease stages.

Major advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of ALL have uncovered new disease-associated biomarkers that can be targeted by biological and small-molecule therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors examine novel approaches to target and drug discovery in ALL over the past 10 years. Cell surface antigens can be targeted by engineered mAbs and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Detailed mechanistic studies in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL and ALL with mixed lineage leukemia rearrangements highlight current molecular approaches to target and drug discovery. Genomic technologies have uncovered genetic alterations that are potentially targetable. In addition, phenotypic screening can uncover unexpected targets. New targets in ALL include cell surface antigens, kinases, tumor suppressors, transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and metabolic enzymes. EXPERT OPINION: There are a number of effective approaches for discovering novel targets in ALL. Target validation is essential for further development of new therapeutics. Identifying select patient subsets with specific genetic vulnerabilities will be important in moving these therapeutics forward clinically.","['Wei, Michael C', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Wei MC', 'Cleary ML']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics , 265 Campus Drive, Lokey Stem Cell Research Building, Stanford, CA 94305 , USA mcwei@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140912,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Drug Discovery', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'genetic alterations', 'mixed lineage leukemia', 'target discovery']",2014/09/13 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17460441.2014.956720 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2014 Dec;9(12):1435-46. doi: 10.1517/17460441.2014.956720.

The remarkable progress in our understanding of the somatic pathogenesis of MDS/MPN has made it clear that there is considerable overlap among these diseases at the molecular level, as well as layers of unexpected complexity. Deregulation of signalling plays an important role in many cases, and is clearly linked to more highly proliferative disease. Other mutations affect a range of other essential, interrelated cellular mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation, RNA splicing, transcription, and DNA damage response. The various combinations of mutations indicate a multi-step pathogenesis, which likely contributes to the marked clinical heterogeneity of these disorders. The delineation of complex clonal architectures may serve as the cornerstone for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and lead to better patient outcomes.

A 67-year-old man with CML presented with progressive back pain 5 months after starting imatinib treatment. Acquired PAP was diagnosed based on physical, radiographic, and histopathological findings. The presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating autoantibodies suggested that autoimmune mechanisms were involved in the pathogenesis. Interestingly, PAP developed in association with imatinib and dasatinib administration, but not with nilotinib treatment. The patient died of refractory leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis with a newly emerged T315I mutation. Although the incidence is very rare, imatinib and dasatinib associated with PAP development has been reported. Meanwhile, PAP in nilotinib-treated patients has not been reported.

Although its efficacy is compromised by a high risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality, an accumulating body of evidence has led to the general recommendation favoring allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling donor during first complete remission (CR1) for younger patients with cytogenetically intermediate- or high-risk AML. Over the past few decades, this field has seen a great many advancements. The indications for allogeneic HCT have been refined by taking into account the molecular profiles of leukemic cells and the degree of comorbidities. The introduction of high-resolution human leukocyte antigen-typing technology and advances in immunosuppressive therapy and supportive care measures have improved outcomes in alternative donor transplantation, while the parallel growth of unrelated donor registries and greater use of umbilical cord blood and haploidentical donors have considerably improved the chance of finding an alternative donor. The development of reduced-intensity and non-myeloablative conditioning has made it possible to receive allogeneic HCT for patients who might once have been considered ineligible due to advanced age or comorbidities. Thanks to these advances, the role of allogeneic HCT during CR1 has become progressively more important in the treatment of AML.","['Yanada, Masamitsu']",['Yanada M'],"['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, 1-98 Dengakugakubo, Kutsukake-cho, Toyoake, 470-1192, Japan, myanada@fujita-hu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140912,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1657-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Mar;101(3):243-54. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1657-0.

While most pediatric ALL treatment protocols mandate regular lumbar punctures (LP) for the intrathecal injection of chemotherapy, the value of routine cytological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during therapy is unknown. Our objective was to assess the diagnostic value of routine CSF analysis during ALL therapy. PROCEDURE: To allow for at least 10 years of follow up from ALL diagnosis, children (0-18 years) with ALL diagnosed and treated at SickKids, Toronto, Canada between 1994-2004 were studied. Medical records of patients with CNS relapse were examined to determine whether CNS relapse was diagnosed based on cytology of a routinely obtained CSF sample, a CSF sample obtained because of signs and symptoms or a CSF sample obtained after the diagnosis of a bone marrow relapse. RESULTS: Of 494 children treated for ALL, 31 (6.6%) developed a relapse of ALL involving the CNS. Twenty-two had an isolated CNS relapse and nine had a combined bone marrow and CNS relapse. Among patients with isolated CNS relapse, 73% (16/22) were diagnosed based on routine CSF samples obtained from asymptomatic children. Conversely, 89% (8/9) of children with combined bone marrow and CNS relapse presented with symptoms and signs that prompted CSF examination. CONCLUSION: Routine CSF examination at the time of LP for intrathecal chemotherapy is useful in detecting CNS relapse.","['Gassas, Adam', 'Krueger, Joerg', 'Alvi, Saima', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Hitzler, Johanne', 'Lieberman, Lani']","['Gassas A', 'Krueger J', 'Alvi S', 'Sung L', 'Hitzler J', 'Lieberman L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140911,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/cerebrospinal fluid/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute', 'chemotherapy', 'hematology/oncology', 'leukemias', 'lymphoblastic leukemia/neurology']",2014/09/13 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25235 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2215-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25235.

Ph-negative clones were analyzed in 14 patients who developed clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph-negative cells during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Mutations were detected in 6/14 patients (43%) affecting the genes DNMT3A, EZH2, RUNX1, TET2, TP53, U2AF1 and ZRSR2. In two patients, the mutations were also found in corresponding Ph-positive diagnostic samples. To further investigate Ph-positive clones, 15 randomly selected CML patients at diagnosis were analyzed. Somatic mutations additional to BCR-ABL were found in 5/15 patients (33%) affecting ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1 and TET2. Analysis of individual hematopoietic colonies at diagnosis revealed that most mutations were part of the Ph-positive clone. In contrast, deep sequencing of subsequent samples during TKI treatment revealed one DNMT3A mutation in Ph-negative cells that was also present in Ph-positive cells at diagnosis, implying that the mutation preceded the BCR-ABL rearrangement. In summary, BCR-ABL-independent gene mutations were frequently found in Ph-negative and Ph-positive clones of CML patients and may be considered as important cofactors in the clonal evolution of CML.","['Schmidt, M', 'Rinke, J', 'Schafer, V', 'Schnittger, S', 'Kohlmann, A', 'Obstfelder, E', 'Kunert, C', 'Ziermann, J', 'Winkelmann, N', 'Eigendorff, E', 'Haferlach, T', 'Haferlach, C', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Ernst, T']","['Schmidt M', 'Rinke J', 'Schafer V', 'Schnittger S', 'Kohlmann A', 'Obstfelder E', 'Kunert C', 'Ziermann J', 'Winkelmann N', 'Eigendorff E', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'MLL Munchner Leukamie Labor, Munchen, Germany.', 'MLL Munchner Leukamie Labor, Munchen, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'MLL Munchner Leukamie Labor, Munchen, Germany.', 'MLL Munchner Leukamie Labor, Munchen, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140912,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014272 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.272 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Dec;28(12):2292-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.272.

However, outcome after ASCT widely varies among AML patients. We analyzed the prognostic significance of haematological recovery for neutrophils [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1.0 x 10(9) /l] and platelets (platelet count >20.0 x 10(9) /l), stratifying at day 20 after ASCT in 88 consecutive and homogeneously treated AML patients in first remission. We observed that patients with delayed recovery had better overall survival (OS; ANC: P < 0.0001 and platelets: P = 0.0062) and time to progression (TTP; ANC: P = 0.0003 and platelets: P = 0.0125). Delayed recovery was an independent marker for better OS and TTP in a multivariate analysis including age, gender, number of transfused CD34+ cells, cytogenetics, FLT3-internal tandem duplication and NPM1 mutation.

METHODOLOGY: All patients in the hematology department of the Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, an 800-bed tertiary hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, older than 14 years of age and who developed febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy for hematological cancers between November 2010 and November 2012 were evaluated in this retrospective observational study. RESULTS: A total of 282 neutropenic episodes in 126 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean patient age was 51.73 +/- 14.4 years (range: 17-82 years), and 66 cases occurred in male patients. The mean Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score of patients with hematological malignancies was 17.18 +/- 8.27. Fifty (39.68%) patients were colonized with VRE, and the mean number of VRE colonization days per patient was 34.27 +/- 13.12 days. Only two patients developed VRE bacteremia: a male patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who survived the infection, and a female patient with acute myeloid leukemia who died from VRE bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hematological malignancies accompanied by VRE colonization should be expected to develop VRE- or vancomycin-sensitive enterococci-related bacteremia under certain conditions, which include the development of severe mucositis, invasive procedures, and the use of intensive broad-spectrum antibiotics, even if infection control measures are implemented properly.","['Gedik, Habip', 'Yildirmak, Taner', 'Simsek, Funda', 'Kanturk, Arzu', 'Arica, Deniz', 'Aydin, Demet', 'Yokus, Osman', 'Demirel, Naciye', 'Arabaci, Cigdem']","['Gedik H', 'Yildirmak T', 'Simsek F', 'Kanturk A', 'Arica D', 'Aydin D', 'Yokus O', 'Demirel N', 'Arabaci C']","['Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. habipgedik@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140912,Italy,J Infect Dev Ctries,Journal of infection in developing countries,101305410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infection Control/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/*isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/13 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3855/jidc.4451 [doi]'],epublish,J Infect Dev Ctries. 2014 Sep 12;8(9):1113-8. doi: 10.3855/jidc.4451.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, PBTD (RS2778)-induced autophagic cell death was verified by LC3-II conversion, and upregulation of Beclin-1 and ATG5. In addition, such compound impeded hyper phosphorylation of AKT as were determined by Western blot. In summary, PBTD (RS2778) inhibited viability and induced multiple cellular events including apoptosis, autophagic cell death, in human MEC1 cells.

The near-universal use of peripheral blood stem cells as source for autografts, routine growth factor support, and antimicrobial prophylaxis post transplantation has improved the safety of this procedure. However, the advent of highly active novel therapies in the last few years warrants reappraisal of the role of autologous transplantation in the therapeutic armamentarium of malignant disorder. This review summarizes the current role of autologous transplantation for hematological malignancies, discusses modern standards for patient selection, and highlights long-term care issues of transplant survivors from an internist's perspective.

Nine months after the initial treatment, he was referred to our hospital because of jaundice. Laboratory data showed elevated serum aminotransferase levels and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity. We diagnosed de novo hepatitis B because a pre-PBSCT serum sample was negative for HBsAg and positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). His liver function improved with entecavir therapy. Two months after his diagnosis of hepatitis B, his 31-year-old wife was admitted with fever and appetite loss. She was diagnosed with acute hepatitis B because of increased serum aminotransferase levels and HBsAg and immunoglobulin M HBcAb positivity. Sequencing of HBV DNA in the serum obtained from both patients showed 99.9% homology. Therefore, we diagnosed her acute hepatitis B as due to horizontal transmission of de novo hepatitis B from her husband. HBV derived from de novo hepatitis B should be considered a potential source of infection, although intrafamilial transmission of de novo hepatitis B is rare.","['Mawatari, Seiichi', 'Uto, Hirofumi', 'Moriuchi, Akihiro', 'Tabu, Kazuaki', 'Muromachi, Kaori', 'Tabu, Eriko', 'Oda, Kohei', 'Imanaka, Dai', 'Oshige, Akihiko', 'Nakazawa, Junichi', 'Kumagai, Kotaro', 'Tamai, Tsutomu', 'Okamoto, Hiroaki', 'Tsubouchi, Hirohito', 'Ido, Akio']","['Mawatari S', 'Uto H', 'Moriuchi A', 'Tabu K', 'Muromachi K', 'Tabu E', 'Oda K', 'Imanaka D', 'Oshige A', 'Nakazawa J', 'Kumagai K', 'Tamai T', 'Okamoto H', 'Tsubouchi H', 'Ido A']","['Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of HGF Tissue Repair and Regenerative Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Infection and Immunity, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of HGF Tissue Repair and Regenerative Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Kagoshima City Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Digestive and Lifestyle Diseases, Department of Human and Environmental Sciences, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of HGF Tissue Repair and Regenerative Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141014,Netherlands,Hepatol Res,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,9711801,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['de novo hepatitis', 'hepatitis B virus reactivation', 'immunosuppressive therapy', 'intrafamilial transmission', 'peripheral blood stem cell transplantation']",2014/09/12 06:00,2014/09/12 06:01,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1111/hepr.12422 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatol Res. 2015 Aug;45(8):933-938. doi: 10.1111/hepr.12422.

The cytotoxic activity of the CH(2)Cl(2) extract and 12 steroids was evaluated in three human cancer cell lines (HL-60, PC-3, and SNU-C5). Relative to the effects of the positive control, mitoxantrone, the CH(2)Cl(2) extract (with an inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC(50)] values ranging from 1.37+/-0.15 to 3.11+/-0.15 mug/mL) and compounds 2 (with IC(50) values ranging from 5.29+/-0.11 to 6.80+/-0.67 muM) and 11 (with IC(50) values ranging from 4.95+/-0.07 to 6.99+/-0.28 muM) exhibited potent cytotoxic effects against all three tested human cancer cell lines. In addition, the CH(2)Cl(2) extract and compounds 2 and 11 were found to induce apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by alterations of the apoptosis-related protein expression, inactivation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and decreased c-Myc expression.

In particular, label-free quantitation approaches are enabling biomarker discovery in terms of statistical comparison of proteomic profiles across large numbers of clinical samples. However, it still remains poorly understood how much protein markers can add novel insights compared to markers derived from mRNA transcriptomic profiling. Using paired label-free LC-MS/MS and gene expression microarray measurements from primary samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we demonstrate here that while the quantitative proteomic and transcriptomic profiles were highly correlated, in general, the marker panels showing statistically significant expression changes across the disease and healthy groups were profoundly different between protein and mRNA levels. In particular, the proteomic assay enabled unique links to known leukemic processes, which were missed when using the transcriptomic profiling alone, as well as identified additional links to metabolic regulators and chromatin remodelers, such as GPX1, fumarate hydratase, and SET oncogene, which have subsequently been evaluated in independent AML samples. Overall, these results highlighted the complementary and informative view obtained from the quantitative LC-MS/MS approach into the AML deregulated signaling networks.","['Elo, Laura L', 'Karjalainen, Riikka', 'Ohman, Tiina', 'Hintsanen, Petteri', 'Nyman, Tuula A', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Aittokallio, Tero']","['Elo LL', 'Karjalainen R', 'Ohman T', 'Hintsanen P', 'Nyman TA', 'Heckman CA', 'Aittokallio T']","['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Turku Centre for Biotechnology, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141015,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteins/*analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Disease network', 'Label-free LC-MS/MS quantitation', 'Protein biomarkers', 'Statistical analysis', 'Systems biology']",2014/09/12 06:00,2015/10/31 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.201300460 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2014 Nov;14(21-22):2443-53. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201300460.

Expanded knowledge of the molecular control of hemoglobin synthesis will provide a basis for rational design of therapies for beta-hemoglobinopathies. Transcriptome data are available for erythroid progenitors derived from adult stem cells, however studies to define molecular mechanisms controlling globin gene regulation during fetal erythropoiesis are limited. Here, we utilize UCB-CD34+ stem cells induced to undergo erythroid differentiation to characterize the transcriptome and transcription factor networks (TFNs) associated with the gamma/beta-globin switch during fetal erythropoiesis. UCB-CD34+ stem cells grown in the one-phase liquid culture system displayed a higher proliferative capacity than adult CD34+ stem cells. The gamma/beta-globin switch was observed after day 42 during fetal erythropoiesis in contrast to adult progenitors where the switch occurred around day 21. To gain insights into transcription factors involved in globin gene regulation, microarray analysis was performed on RNA isolated from UCB-CD34+ cell-derived erythroid progenitors harvested on day 21, 42, 49 and 56 using the HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChip. After data normalization, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified transcription factors (TFs) with significant changes in expression during the gamma/beta-globin switch. Forty-five TFs were silenced by day 56 (Profile-1) and 30 TFs were activated by day 56 (Profile-2). Both GSEA datasets were analyzed using the MIMI Cytoscape platform, which discovered TFNs centered on KLF4 and GATA2 (Profile-1) and KLF1 and GATA1 for Profile-2 genes. Subsequent shRNA studies in KU812 leukemia cells and human erythroid progenitors generated from UCB-CD34+ cells supported a negative role of MAFB in gamma-globin regulation. The characteristics of erythroblasts derived from UCB-CD34+ stem cells including prolonged gamma-globin expression combined with unique TFNs support novel mechanisms controlling the gamma/beta-globin switch during UCB-derived erythropoiesis.","['Li, Biaoru', 'Ding, Lianghao', 'Yang, Chinrang', 'Kang, Baolin', 'Liu, Li', 'Story, Michael D', 'Pace, Betty S']","['Li B', 'Ding L', 'Yang C', 'Kang B', 'Liu L', 'Story MD', 'Pace BS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology/Oncology Division, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology/Oncology Division, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology/Oncology Division, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140911,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (gamma-Globins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta-Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'gamma-Globins/biosynthesis/metabolism']",,,2014/09/12 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107133 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-15421 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 11;9(9):e107133. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107133. eCollection 2014.,,"['P30 CA142543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1P30 CA142543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL069234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4161396,,,['GEO/GSE49438'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is up-regulated in diabetic mice. However, the molecular mechanism of high glucose (HG)-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis remains obscure. We aimed to determine the role of HMGB1 in HG-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Treating neonatal primary cardiomyocytes with HG increased cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by elevated levels of HMGB1. Inhibition of HMGB1 by short-hairpin RNA significantly decreased HG-induced cell apoptosis by reducing caspase-3 activation and ratio of Bcl2-associated X protein to B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bax/bcl-2). Furthermore, HG activated E26 transformation-specific sequence-1 (Ets-1), and HMGB1 inhibition attenuated HG-induced activation of Ets-1 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signalling. In addition, inhibition of Ets-1 significantly decreased HG-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Similar results were observed in streptozotocin-treated diabetic mice. Inhibition of HMGB1 by short-hairpin RNA markedly decreased myocardial cell apoptosis and activation of ERK and Ets-1 in diabetic mice. In conclusion, inhibition of HMGB1 may protect against hyperglycaemia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by down-regulating ERK-dependent activation of Ets-1.","['Wang, Wen-Ke', 'Lu, Qing-Hua', 'Zhang, Jia-Ning', 'Wang, Ben', 'Liu, Xiang-Juan', 'An, Feng-Shuang', 'Qin, Wei-Dong', 'Chen, Xue-Ying', 'Dong, Wen-Qian', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Zhang, Yun', 'Zhang, Ming-Xiang']","['Wang WK', 'Lu QH', 'Zhang JN', 'Wang B', 'Liu XJ', 'An FS', 'Qin WD', 'Chen XY', 'Dong WQ', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang MX']","['The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140911,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Diabetic Cardiomyopathies/*genetics/pathology', 'HMGB1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/metabolism/pathology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ets-1', 'HMGB1', 'apoptosis', 'cardiomyocyte', 'diabetes', 'high glucose']",2014/09/12 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.12399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2014 Nov;18(11):2311-20. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.12399.

We thus investigated the role of various anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins for apoptosis protection in SCC using the BH3 agonist ABT737 that can overcome multidomain Bcl-2 protein protection. Sensitive SCC cells underwent rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), subsequent apoptosis concomitant with caspase-3 activation and an early release of mitochondria-derived cytochrome c and smac/DIABLO. In contrast, ABT737 resistance in subsets of SCC cells was not explained by XIAP, important for protection from DR-induced apoptosis in SCC. Of note, ABT737 did not prime SCC cells to DR-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the ratio of Mcl-1 and Noxa determined sensitivity to ABT737: loss of Mcl-1 rendered resistant cells sensitive to ABT737, whereas loss of Noxa promoted resistance in sensitive cells. In line, suppression of Mcl-1 by the pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor Obatoclax or overexpression of Noxa rendered resistant SCC cells sensitive to BH3 mimetics. Our data indicate that targeting of the Mcl-1/Noxa axis is important to overcome resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis in SCC. Therefore, combination treatment of ABT737 or derivatives with Mcl-1 inhibitors, or inducers of Noxa, may represent a novel option of targeted therapy in metastatic SCC of the skin.","['Geserick, P', 'Wang, J', 'Feoktistova, M', 'Leverkus, M']","['Geserick P', 'Wang J', 'Feoktistova M', 'Leverkus M']","['Section of Molecular Dermatology, Department of Dermatology, Venerology, and Allergology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Section of Molecular Dermatology, Department of Dermatology, Venerology, and Allergology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Section of Molecular Dermatology, Department of Dermatology, Venerology, and Allergology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Section of Molecular Dermatology, Department of Dermatology, Venerology, and Allergology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140911,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,,2014/09/12 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014379 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.379 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Sep 11;5:e1412. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.379.,,,PMC4540197,,['Cell Death Dis. 2015;6:e1673.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vitro antitumor activity of Cordyceps militaris fraction (CMF) and the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis it induces in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CMF was prepared according to our previous report. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. The rate of apoptosis, distribution of cell cycle and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry. Caspase activities were analyzed by Western blot and oxygen consumption rate was recorded using the Oxytherm system. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that CMF triggered growth inhibition in K562 cells with only minor toxicity on a normal human cell line and inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with IC50 value of 34.1 +/- 2.0 mug/ml after 48 h incubation. This most likely resulted from cell cycle arrest at the S phase and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, CMF induced activation of caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). The caspase signals may originate from mitochondrial dysfunction, which was supported by the finding of decreased mitochondria transmembrance potential and the lower oxygen consumption rate. CONCLUSION: CMF possessed the in vitro antitumor effect on K562 cells and CMF-induced apoptosis might be involved by the mitochondrial dysfunction and valuable to research and develop as a potential antitumor agency.","['Tian, Tian', 'Song, Liyan', 'Zheng, Qin', 'Hu, Xianjing', 'Yu, Rongmin']","['Tian T', 'Song L', 'Zheng Q', 'Hu X', 'Yu R']","['Biotechnological Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Biotechnological Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou, China.', 'Biotechnological Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Pharmacogn Mag,Pharmacognosy magazine,101300403,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cordyceps militaris', 'K562 cells', 'mitochondria dysfunction']",2014/09/12 06:00,2014/09/12 06:01,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-1296.137374 [doi]', 'PM-10-325 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogn Mag. 2014 Jul;10(39):325-31. doi: 10.4103/0973-1296.137374.,,,PMC4159927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects occur through autocrine and paracrine signaling events initiated by interactions between secreted BDNF and its high-affinity receptor, TrkB. A BDNF/TrkB autocrine/paracrine signaling loop has additionally been implicated in augmenting the survival of cells representing several human cancers and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a fatal malignancy caused by infection with the complex retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In this study, we found that the HTLV-1-encoded protein HBZ activates expression of BDNF, and consistent with this effect, BDNF expression is elevated in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines compared to uninfected T cells. Expression of TrkB is also higher in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines than in uninfected T cells. Furthermore, levels of both BDNF and TrkB mRNAs are elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ATL patients, and ATL patient sera contain higher concentrations of BDNF than sera from noninfected individuals. Finally, chemical inhibition of TrkB signaling increases apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected T cells and reduces phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), a downstream target in the signaling pathway. These results suggest that HBZ contributes to an active BDNF/TrkB autocrine/paracrine signaling loop in HTLV-1-infected T cells that enhances the survival of these cells. IMPORTANCE: Infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) can cause a rare form of leukemia designated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Because ATL patients are unresponsive to chemotherapy, this malignancy is fatal. As a retrovirus, HTLV-1 integrates its genome into a host cell chromosome in order to utilize host factors for replication and expression of viral proteins. However, in infected cells from ATL patients, the viral genome is frequently modified to block expression of all but a single viral protein. This protein, known as HBZ, is therefore believed to modulate cellular pathways necessary for the leukemic state and the chemotherapeutic resistance of the cell. Here we provide evidence to support this hypothesis. We found that HBZ promotes a BDNF/TrkB autocrine/paracrine signaling pathway that is known to enhance the survival and chemotherapeutic resistance of other types of cancer cells. It is possible that inhibition of this pathway may improve treatments for ATL.","['Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Terol, Marie', 'Hoang, Kimson', 'Nash, Isabelle', 'Laverdure, Sylvain', 'Gazon, Helene', 'Belrose, Gilda', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Cesaire, Raymond', 'Peloponese, Jean-Marie', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Polakowski N', 'Terol M', 'Hoang K', 'Nash I', 'Laverdure S', 'Gazon H', 'Belrose G', 'Mesnard JM', 'Cesaire R', 'Peloponese JM', 'Lemasson I']","['Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA CPBS, CNRS UMR 5236, Universite Montpellier 1, Montpellier, France.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'CPBS, CNRS UMR 5236, Universite Montpellier 1, Montpellier, France Laboratoire de Virologie-Immunologie JE2503, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Fort de France, Fort de France, Martinique.', 'Laboratoire de Virologie-Immunologie JE2503, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Fort de France, Fort de France, Martinique.', 'CPBS, CNRS UMR 5236, Universite Montpellier 1, Montpellier, France.', 'Laboratoire de Virologie-Immunologie JE2503, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Fort de France, Fort de France, Martinique.', 'CPBS, CNRS UMR 5236, Universite Montpellier 1, Montpellier, France.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA lemassoni@ecu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140910,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '7171WSG8A2 (BDNF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (tropomyosin-related kinase-B, human)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2014/09/12 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02285-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02285-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Nov;88(22):13482-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02285-14.

The disease was characterized by a massive increase in well-granulated, mature, and often spindle-shaped MCs (80 %) in BM smears. The serum tryptase level amounted to 332 ng/mL. Like in most other MCL patients, no skin lesions were detected. However, unlike in other patients, tryptase levels remained stable, and no other signs or symptoms of MCL-induced organ damage were found. Sequencing studies revealed an isolated S476I point mutation in KIT but no mutation in codon 816. The patient received histamine receptor blockers but refused cytoreductive therapy. After 9 months, still no progression or organ damage was detected. However, progression with transformation to acute MCL occurred after 12 months.

The residues essential for primer annealing are initially locked in intramolecular interactions; hence, annealing requires the chaperone activity of the retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) protein to facilitate structural rearrangements. Here we show that, unlike classical chaperones, the Moloney murine leukaemia virus NC uses a unique mechanism for remodelling: it specifically targets multiple structured regions in both the U5-PBS and tRNA(Pro) primer that otherwise sequester residues necessary for annealing. This high-specificity and high-affinity binding by NC consequently liberates these sequestered residues--which are exactly complementary--for intermolecular interactions.

However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been fully elucidated for patients aged 70 years or older. Here, we retrospectively analyzed elderly patients with aggressive ATL at Nagasaki University Hospital between 1994 and 2010 to assess treatment outcomes. Of 148 evaluable patients, 54 were aged 70 years or older at diagnosis. The median survival time (MST) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years in elderly patients were 10.6 months and 22.1%, respectively. Thirty-four patients received VCAP-AMP-VECP as the initial treatment, although the doses were reduced for most patients. In these patients, MST and OS at 2 years were 13.4 months and 26.6%, respectively. Eleven of 34 patients (32%) received maintenance oral chemotherapy after two or three cycles of VCAP-AMP-VECP, and MST and OS at 2 years were 16.7 months and 32.7%, respectively.

However, minimal research, particularly with cancer, has been conducted. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of TM and describe a clinical case review study to obtain preliminary evidence of TM's safety and effect on patients treated for cancer or hematologic disorders. METHODS: A retrospective case review was conducted in India and cases met the following inclusion criteria: (a) confirmed diagnosis of cancer or hematologic disorder by standard Western biomedical diagnostic tests, (b) either treated exclusively with TM or received insufficient Western treatment followed by TM and (c) were in remission or had stable disease at least 2 years after start of TM. RESULTS: Three cases were identified, 1 solid tumor and 2 hematologic diseases: Case 1--poorly to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach, positive lymph nodes and mucosal infiltration, with clear scans and excellent quality of life 29 months later ; Case 2--chronic myelogenous leukemia with normalization of hematologic labs within 3 months of starting TM and stable 4 years later; and Case 3--red cell aplasia improved significantly and reversed dependence on blood transfusions with TM. None of the cases experienced demonstrable adverse effects from TM. CONCLUSIONS: This limited case review found TM to be safe and have positive effects on quality of life and disease regression and remission in patients with cancer and blood disorders. Further exploration and investigation using rigorous methods is warranted.","['Bauer-Wu, Susan', 'Lhundup, Tenzin', 'Tidwell, Tawni', 'Lhadon, Tenzin', 'Ozawa-de Silva, Chikako', 'Dolma, Jamyang', 'Dorjee, Pema', 'Neshar, Dorjee Rapten', 'Sangmo, Rigzin', 'Yeshi, Tenzin']","['Bauer-Wu S', 'Lhundup T', 'Tidwell T', 'Lhadon T', 'Ozawa-de Silva C', 'Dolma J', 'Dorjee P', 'Neshar DR', 'Sangmo R', 'Yeshi T']","['University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA bauer-wu@virginia.edu.', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Tibetan Medical & Astro Institute, Dharamsala, India Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).', 'Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA Tibetan Medical College, Qinghai University, Xining, Qinghai, P.R.C.', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Tibetan Medical & Astro Institute, Dharamsala, India Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).', 'Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Salugara Branch Clinic, Salugara, India Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Tibetan Medical & Astro Institute, Dharamsala, India Men-Tsee-Khang retired physician Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Bengaluru Branch Clinic, Tibetan Medical Centre, Bangalore, India Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Tibetan Medical & Astro Institute, Dharamsala, India Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).', 'Men-Tsee-Khang, Tibetan Medical & Astro Institute, Dharamsala, India Kachupa is similar to Bachelor of Science in Medicine (BS), and Menrampa is similar to Doctor of Medicine (MD).']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140910,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology/therapy', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Medicine, Tibetan Traditional/adverse effects/*methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/pathology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['CAM', 'Tibetan medicine', 'case study', 'integrative oncology', 'whole systems']",2014/09/12 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1534735414549624 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735414549624 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2014 Nov;13(6):502-12. doi: 10.1177/1534735414549624.

Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic or magnetic fields is also increasing. Epidemiological studies show consistent associations of childhood leukaemia with exposure to magnetic fields but any causal relationship is unclear. A limitation in assessing the consequence of such exposure is the availability of sensitive assays. The embryonic neuronal stem and progenitor cell compartments are radiosensitive tissues. Using sensitive assays, we report a statistically significant increase in DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and apoptosis in the embryonic neuronal stem cell compartment following in utero exposure to 10-200 mGy X-rays. Both endpoints show a linear response. We also show that DSB repair is delayed following exposure to doses below 50 mGy compared with 100 mGy. Thus, we demonstrate in vivo consequences of low-dose radiation. In contrast to these impacts, we did not observe any significant induction of DSBs or apoptosis following exposure to 50 Hz magnetic fields (100 or 300 microT). We conclude that any DSB induction by treatment with magnetic fields is lower than following exposure to 10 mGy X-rays. For comparison, certain procedures involving computed tomography scanning are equivalent to 1-5 mGy X-rays.","['Saha, Shreya', 'Woodbine, Lisa', 'Haines, Jackie', 'Coster, Margaret', 'Ricket, Nicole', 'Barazzuol, Lara', 'Ainsbury, Elizabeth', 'Sienkiewicz, Zenon', 'Jeggo, Penny']","['Saha S', 'Woodbine L', 'Haines J', 'Coster M', 'Ricket N', 'Barazzuol L', 'Ainsbury E', 'Sienkiewicz Z', 'Jeggo P']","['Genome Damage and Stability Centre, Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN19RQ, UK.', 'Genome Damage and Stability Centre, Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN19RQ, UK.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Chilton, Didcot, Oxford OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Chilton, Didcot, Oxford OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'Genome Damage and Stability Centre, Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN19RQ, UK.', 'Genome Damage and Stability Centre, Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN19RQ, UK.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Chilton, Didcot, Oxford OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Chilton, Didcot, Oxford OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'Genome Damage and Stability Centre, Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN19RQ, UK p.a.jeggo@sussex.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Brain/*embryology/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Magnetic Fields', 'Mice', 'Neural Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'X-Rays/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'DNA double-strand breaks', 'apoptosis', 'extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields', 'low-dose radiation']",2014/09/12 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['rsif.2014.0783 [pii]', '10.1098/rsif.2014.0783 [doi]']",ppublish,J R Soc Interface. 2014 Nov 6;11(100):20140783. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2014.0783.,,['G1000050/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC4191111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adult zebrafish, we investigated that the xenografted leukemia stem cells (LSCs) from K562 cells could proliferate in vivo and keep the cancer property by re-transplantation. As for the solid tumor, these CSCs from DU145 cells (human prostate cancer) and HepG2 cells (human liver cancer) could form the tumor mass and even metastasis after xenotransplantation. In addition, the zebrafish embryos with CSC xenotransplantation could evaluate docetaxel in vivo efficiently and be available to screen the novel inhibitors by high-throughput manner.

We detected aberrant expression of ALDH1A genes, particularly ALDH1A2, in a majority (72%) of primary paediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) specimens. ALDH1A expression was almost exclusive to T-lineage, but not B-lineage, ALL. To determine whether ALDH1A expression may have relevance to T-ALL cell growth and survival, the effect of inhibiting ALDH1A function was measured on a panel of human ALL cell lines. This revealed that T-ALL proliferation had a higher sensitivity to modulation of ALDH1A activity and RA signalling as compared to ALL cell lines of B-lineage. Consistent with these findings, the genes most highly correlated with ALDH1A2 expression were involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Evidence that such genes may be targets of regulation via RA signalling initiated by ALDH1A activity was provided by the TNFRSF10B gene, encoding the apoptotic death receptor TNFRSF10B (also termed TRAIL-R2), which negatively correlated with ALDH1A2 and showed elevated transcription following treatment of T-ALL cell lines with the ALDH1A inhibitor citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal).

Inhibition of NANOG or its paralog NANOGP8 reduces the proliferation, stemness, and tumorigenicity of colorectal carcinoma cells. Our hypothesis was that inhibition of NANOG/NANOGP8 enhances the cytotoxic effect of BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2 family members in colorectal carcinoma cells through reducing expression of MCL-1, a prosurvival BCL-2 protein. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lentiviral vector (LV) shRNA to NANOG (shNG-1) or NANOGP8 (shNp8-1) transduced colorectal carcinoma cells that were also exposed to the BH3 mimetics ABT-737 or ABT-199 in vivo in colorectal carcinoma xenografts and in vitro where proliferation, protein and gene expression, and apoptosis were measured. RESULTS: Clone A and CX-1 were sensitive to ABT-737 and ABT-199 at IC50s of 2 to 9 mumol/L but LS174T was resistant with IC50s of 18 to 30 mumol/L. Resistance was associated with high MCL-1 expression in LS174T. LVshNG-1 or LVshNp8-1 decreased MCL-1 expression, increased apoptosis, and decreased replating efficiency in colorectal carcinoma cells treated with either ABT-737 or ABT-199 compared with the effects of either BH3 mimetic alone. Inhibition or overexpression of MCL-1 alone replicated the effects of LVshNG-1 or LVshNp8-1 in increasing or decreasing the apoptosis caused with the BH3 mimetic. The combination therapy inhibited the growth of LS174T xenografts in vivo compared with untreated controls or treatment with only LV shRNA or ABT-737. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of NANOGP8 or NANOG enhances the cytotoxicity of BH3 mimetics that target BCL-2 family members. Gene therapy targeting the NANOGs may increase the efficacy of BH3 mimetics in colorectal carcinoma.","['Mattoo, Abid R', 'Zhang, Jingyu', 'Espinoza, Luis A', 'Jessup, J Milburn']","['Mattoo AR', 'Zhang J', 'Espinoza LA', 'Jessup JM']","['Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.

We conducted a national survey including 1,082 CML patients identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database covering a period between 1998 and 2011; the matched non-exposed cohort included 10,820 subjects without CML that were matched for age, sex and comorbidities. The impact of TB was measured by the overall mortality, and the risk factors were identified by a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. We found the risk of TB was higher in the CML cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 3.76 (p = 0.001) for both pulmonary (aHR 3.23, p < 0.001) and extrapulmonary (aHR 9.77, p = 0.001) TB. Specific risk factors were: aged >/= 60 (aHR 3.24, p = 0.022), being male (aHR 13.49, p = 0.012), receiving stem cell transplantation (aHR 10.50, p = 0.001) and interferon-alpha therapy (aHR 3.34, p = 0.011). CML patients with TB had a higher mortality rate than those without (aHR 2.04, p = 0.043). We conclude that the incidence of TB is significantly higher in CML patients of male sex, aged >/= 60, having received either stem cell transplantation or interferon-alpha treatment.

Here, we evaluate potential determinants of PCB levels in dust from California homes including characteristics of the residence as well as the residents' habits and occupations. Dust was collected from 415 households as part of a large case-control study (the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study), using a high-volume small surface sampler. Dust concentrations of 6 PCBs (PCB-105, PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153, PCB-170, and PCB-180) were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Individual PCB detection rates ranged from 9% to 54% with PCB concentrations ranging from below detection (1 or 2 ng g (-1)) to 270 ng g(-1) and PCB loadings ranging from below detection to 960 ng m (-2). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to identify potential determinants of residential PCB contamination based on in-home interviews and residential geographic locations. We observed that residences built prior to 1980 had higher odds of PCB detection and higher PCB loadings than more recently constructed homes. Households where residents typically did not remove their shoes had higher PCB dust loadings than households where residents did. PCBs were less likely to be detected in carpet dust from households that had frequently vacuumed or replaced carpets compared to other households. Since we used a cross-sectional dust sampling protocol and report significant, but modest, effects of these determinants on levels of PCBs in residential dust, our results should be interpreted with caution. Longitudinal studies to determine optimal strategies for reducing PCBs in homes are warranted.","['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Nishioka, Marcia G', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Metayer, Catherine']","['Whitehead TP', 'Ward MH', 'Colt JS', 'Nishioka MG', 'Buffler PA', 'Rappaport SM', 'Metayer C']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. toddpwhitehead@berkeley.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121126,England,Environ Sci Process Impacts,Environmental science.

The joint FAO/WHO committee recommended banning the use of chloramphenicol (CAP) in food animals due to its public health hazards of aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, allergy, antibacterial resistance and carcinogenicity. This paper determines the prevalence of CAP residues in chicken eggs and assesses the usage and awareness of its ban amongst poultry farmers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey of registered poultry farmers in FCT was conducted using questionnaires to determine CAP administration in poultry and awareness of its ban. Pooled egg samples were collected from each poultry farm surveyed and from randomly sampled government-owned markets in FCT. Source of eggs by state were identified by the marketer at the time of collection. Samples were analysed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique for the presence of CAP, and prevalence was determined. Of 288 total pooled samples collected, 257 (89.2%) were from the markets and 31 (10.8%) were from poultry farms. A total of 20 (7%) pooled egg samples tested CAP-positive; market eggs originated from 15 (41%) states of the country. Of the market eggs, 16 (6.2%) pooled samples tested positive. Of eggs from poultry farms, four (12.9%) tested positive. Mean CAP concentrations in the positive samples ranged from 0.49 to 1.17 microg kg(-1) (parts per billion). CAP use amongst poultry farmers in FCT was 75.5%; awareness of the CAP ban was 26.3%. Though 66% of veterinarians were unaware of a CAP ban, they were more likely to be aware than other poultry farmers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.4). Farm managers who use CAP were more likely to be aware of CAP ban than the farm managers not using CAP (OR = 5.5; p = 0.04). Establishing a drug residue surveillance and control program and enforcement of CAP legislation/regulation is needful to educate and prohibit the widespread CAP use amongst Nigerian poultry farmers.","['Mbodi, Felix E', 'Nguku, P', 'Okolocha, E', 'Kabir, J']","['Mbodi FE', 'Nguku P', 'Okolocha E', 'Kabir J']","['a Nigeria Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Programme (NFELTP) , Abuja , Nigeria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141007,England,Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess,"Food additives & contaminants.

We highlight the various issues to consider in the pretransplant, transplant and posttransplant periods with emphasis on the management of relapse following transplant. RECENT FINDINGS: Cytogenetic and molecular characteristics are becoming more important in predicting transplant outcome. Hypomethylating agents are effective in the pretransplant setting to reduce disease burden. Haploidentical and umbilical cord blood donations may be valid transplant options for patients without human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling or match unrelated donor options. A preemptive management approach to patients at high risk of relapse is more effective. Adjusting the timing and dose of donor lymphocyte infusion reduces the risk of graft-versus-host disease without jeopardizing the graft-versus-leukaemia effect of donor lymphocyte infusion. SUMMARY: Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is curative in up to 40% of myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Appropriate patient selection, modification of conditioning regimes and donor selection should be considered carefully. A preemptive approach for the management of patients at high risk of relapse should be employed following transplant, with the use of immune modulating therapies such as donor lymphocyte infusion and azacitidine.","['Bart-Smith, Emily', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Bart-Smith E', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematology, King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*surgery']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2015/07/16 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000137 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2014 Nov;26(6):642-9. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known regarding the association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rarer subtype. METHODS: We obtained original data on prenatal use of folic acid and vitamins from 12 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (enrollment period: 1980-2012), including 6,963 cases of ALL, 585 cases of AML, and 11,635 controls. Logistic regression was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for child's age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, and study center. RESULTS: Maternal supplements taken any time before conception or during pregnancy were associated with a reduced risk of childhood ALL; odds ratios were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.78-0.92) for vitamin use and 0.80 (0.71-0.89) for folic acid use. The reduced risk was more pronounced in children whose parents' education was below the highest category. The analyses for AML led to somewhat unstable estimates; ORs were 0.92 (0.75-1.14) and 0.68 (0.48-0.96) for prenatal vitamins and folic acid, respectively. There was no strong evidence that risks of either types of leukemia varied by period of supplementation (preconception, pregnancy, or trimester). CONCLUSIONS: Our results, based on the largest number of childhood leukemia cases to date, suggest that maternal prenatal use of vitamins and folic acid reduces the risk of both ALL and AML and that the observed association with ALL varied by parental education, a surrogate for lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics.","['Metayer, Catherine', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Dockerty, John D', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Wesseling, Catharina', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Petridou, Eleni', 'Ezzat, Sameera', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Koifman, Sergio', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Rashed, Wafaa M', 'Selvin, Steve', 'McCauley, Kathryn', 'Hung, Rayjean J', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire']","['Metayer C', 'Milne E', 'Dockerty JD', 'Clavel J', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Wesseling C', 'Spector LG', 'Schuz J', 'Petridou E', 'Ezzat S', 'Armstrong BK', 'Rudant J', 'Koifman S', 'Kaatsch P', 'Moschovi M', 'Rashed WM', 'Selvin S', 'McCauley K', 'Hung RJ', 'Kang AY', 'Infante-Rivard C']","[""From the aUniversity of California, School of Public Health, Berkeley, CA; bTelethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, West Perth, Western Australia; cDean's Department and Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; dInserm, CESP Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Environmental Epidemiology of Cancer Team, Universite Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France; ePediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Program, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; fInstituto Regional de Estudios en Sustancias Toxicas (IRET), Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica; gDivision of Epidemiology Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; hInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France; iDepartment of Hygiene, Epidemiology, and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece; jResearch Department, Children's Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt; kSydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; lNational School of Public Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; mGerman Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Centre, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany; nLunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and oDepartment of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,"['0 (Vitamins)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamins/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/EDE.0000000000000141 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2014 Nov;25(6):811-22. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000141.,,"['P01 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA132172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03CA132172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5903563,['NIHMS954242'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with these malignancies are largely unknown. In this study, we have first profiled molecular signatures associated with IRF4 expression in associated cancers, by analyzing existing gene expression profiling datasets. Our results show that IRF4 is overexpressed in melanoma, in addition to previously reported contexts including leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma, and that IRF4 is associated with a unique gene expression pattern in each context. A pool of important genes involved in B-cell development, oncogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and cell death including BATF, LIMD1, CFLAR, PIM2, and CCND2 are common signatures associated with IRF4 in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. We confirmed the correlation of IRF4 with LIMD1 and CFLAR in a panel of cell lines derived from lymphomas. Moreover, we profiled the IRF4 transcriptome in the context of EBV latent infection, and confirmed several genes including IFI27, IFI44, GBP1, and ARHGAP18, as well as CFLAR as novel targets for IRF4. These results provide valuable information for understanding the IRF4 regulatory network, and improve our knowledge of the unique roles of IRF4 in different hematological malignancies.","['Wang, Ling', 'Yao, Zhi Q', 'Moorman, Jonathan P', 'Xu, Yanji', 'Ning, Shunbin']","['Wang L', 'Yao ZQ', 'Moorman JP', 'Xu Y', 'Ning S']","['Center for Inflammation, Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee, United States of America.', 'Center for Inflammation, Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee, United States of America; HIV/HCV Program, James H.

The frequency and spectrum of genetic alterations in Ph-like ALL and its responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibition are undefined, especially in adolescents and adults. METHODS: We performed genomic profiling of 1725 patients with precursor B-cell ALL and detailed genomic analysis of 154 patients with Ph-like ALL. We examined the functional effects of fusion proteins and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse pre-B cells and xenografts of human Ph-like ALL. RESULTS: Ph-like ALL increased in frequency from 10% among children with standard-risk ALL to 27% among young adults with ALL and was associated with a poor outcome. Kinase-activating alterations were identified in 91% of patients with Ph-like ALL; rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, NTRK3, PDGFRB, PTK2B, TSLP, or TYK2 and sequence mutations involving FLT3, IL7R, or SH2B3 were most common. Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trials identifying Ph-like ALL are needed to assess whether adding tyrosine kinase inhibitors to current therapy will improve the survival of patients with this type of leukemia.

This synthetic route features a palladium-catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of a C2-symmetric diol to form the C9-deoxygenated bryostatin A-ring. WN-1 binds to PKCalpha (Ki = 16.1 nM) and inhibits the growth of multiple leukemia cell lines. Although structural features of the WN-1 A-ring and C-ring are shared by analogues that display bryostatin-like behavior, WN-1 displays PMA-like behavior in U937 cell attachment and proliferation assays, as well as in K562 and MV-4-11 proliferation assays.

Cases of severe food allergic reactions caused by HWPs have been reported. Recent data suggest that these reactions are caused by HWPs produced by acid hydrolysis. OBJECTIVES: To examine the sensitizing capacity of gluten proteins per se when altered by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis relative to unmodified gluten in rats naive to gluten. METHODS: High IgE-responder Brown Norway (BN) rats bred on a gluten-free diet were sensitized without the use of adjuvant to three different gluten products (unmodified, acid hydrolyzed and enzymatic hydrolyzed). Rats were sensitized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) immunization three times with 200 microg gluten protein/rat or by oral dosing for 35 days with 0.2, 2 or 20 mg gluten protein/rat/day. Sera were analyzed for specific IgG and IgE and IgG-binding capacity by ELISA. IgE functionality was measured by rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) assay. RESULTS: Regardless of the route of dosing, all products had sensitizing capacity. When sensitized i.p., all three gluten products induced a strong IgG1 response in all animals. Acid hydrolyzed gluten induced the highest level of specific IgE but with a low functionality. Orally all three gluten products induced specific IgG1 and IgE but with different dose-response relations. Sensitizing rats i.p. or orally with unmodified or enzymatic hydrolyzed gluten induced specific IgG1 responses with similar binding capacity which was different from that of acid hydrolyzed gluten indicating that acid hydrolysis of gluten proteins induces formation of 'new' epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: In rats not tolerant to gluten acid hydrolysis of gluten enhances the sensitizing capacity by the i.p. but not by the oral route. In addition, acid hydrolysis induces formation of new epitopes. This is in contrast to the enzymatic hydrolyzed gluten having an epitope pattern similar to unmodified gluten.","['Kroghsbo, Stine', 'Andersen, Nanna B', 'Rasmussen, Tina F', 'Jacobsen, Susanne', 'Madsen, Charlotte B']","['Kroghsbo S', 'Andersen NB', 'Rasmussen TF', 'Jacobsen S', 'Madsen CB']","['National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.', 'National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.', 'National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.', 'Enzyme and Protein Chemistry, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.', 'National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140910,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Acids)', '0 (Allergens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '8002-80-0 (Glutens)']",IM,"['Acids', 'Administration, Oral', '*Allergens', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Glutens/administration & dosage/chemistry/*immunology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Plant Proteins/administration & dosage/chemistry/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Wheat Hypersensitivity/*immunology/physiopathology']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107137 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-15730 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 10;9(9):e107137. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107137. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4160220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a crucial mediator for the cellular effects of vitamin D. In fact It has been hypothesized that polymorphisms in the VDR gene affect cancer risk and the relevance of VDR gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms for various types of cancer has been investigated by a great number of studies. However, results from previous studies on the association of VDR polymorphisms with different cancer types are somewhat contradictory, and the role of VDR in the etiology of cancer is still equivocal. We have performed a systematic review of the literature to analyze the relevance of more VDR polymorphisms (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1, and Cdx2) for individual malignancies, including cancer of the skin (melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer), ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, thyroid carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma, head and neck and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Up to June 2012, we identified 79 independent studies for a total of 52427 cases and 62225 controls. Significant associations with VDR polymorphisms have been reported for prostate (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1), breast (Fok1, Bsm1, Apa1), colon-rectum (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1) and skin cancer (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1). Very few studies reported risk estimates for the other cancer sites. Conflicting data have been reported for most malignancies and at present it is still not possible to make any definitive statements about the importance of the VDR genotype for cancer risk. It seems probable that interactions with other factors such as calcium and vitamin D intake, 25(OH)D plasma levels and UV radiation exposure play a decisive role in cancer risk. To conclude, there is some indication that VDR polymorphisms may modulate the risk of some cancer sites and in future studies VDR genetic variation should be integrated also with prediagnostic indicator of vitamin D status.","['Gandini, Sara', 'Gnagnarella, Patrizia', 'Serrano, Davide', 'Pasquali, Elena', 'Raimondi, Sara']","['Gandini S', 'Gnagnarella P', 'Serrano D', 'Pasquali E', 'Raimondi S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*blood/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*blood/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*blood/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Skin Neoplasms/*blood/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-0437-2_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2014;810:69-105. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-0437-2_5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our group have previously demonstrated that multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells spontaneously shed microparticles (MPs) and that these MPs can transfer resistance to drug-responsive cells and confer MDR on those cells in as little as 4 h. Furthermore, we also showed that, unlike MPs derived from leukaemia cells, breast cancer-derived MPs display a tissue selectivity in the transfer of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), transferring the resistance protein only to malignant breast cells. This study aims to define the proteome of breast cancer-derived MPs in order to understand the differences in protein profiles between those shed from drug-resistant versus drug-sensitive breast cancer cells. In doing so, we detail the protein cargo required for the intercellular transfer of MDR to drug-sensitive recipient cells and the factors governing the transfer selectivity to malignant breast cells. We describe the first proteomic analysis of MPs derived from human breast cancer cells using SDS PAGE and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), in which we identify 120 unique proteins found only in drug-resistant, breast cancer-derived MPs. Our results demonstrate that the MP-mediated transfer of P-gp to recipient cells occurs alongside CD44; the Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin protein family (ERM); and cytoskeleton motor proteins within the MP cargo.","['Pokharel, Deep', 'Padula, Matthew P', 'Lu, Jamie F', 'Tacchi, Jessica L', 'Luk, Frederick', 'Djordjevic, Steven P', 'Bebawy, Mary']","['Pokharel D', 'Padula MP', 'Lu JF', 'Tacchi JL', 'Luk F', 'Djordjevic SP', 'Bebawy M']","['Discipline of Pharmacy, The Graduate School of Health, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'The ithree Institute, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia ; Proteomics Core Facility, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Discipline of Pharmacy, The Graduate School of Health, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'The ithree Institute, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Discipline of Pharmacy, The Graduate School of Health, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'The ithree Institute, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia ; Proteomics Core Facility, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Discipline of Pharmacy, The Graduate School of Health, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140822,United States,J Extracell Vesicles,Journal of extracellular vesicles,101610479,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'breast cancer', 'liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry', 'microparticles', 'multidrug resistance', 'proteomics', 'tissue selectivity']",2014/09/11 06:00,2014/09/11 06:01,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3402/jev.v3.24384 [doi]', '24384 [pii]']",epublish,J Extracell Vesicles. 2014 Aug 22;3. pii: 24384. doi: 10.3402/jev.v3.24384. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4142226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breast metastasis might be the first symptom or may occur during the course of other malignancies dominantly arising from the contralateral breast. Leukemia, lung cancer and conjunctival melanoma may spread to the breast. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old female patient was operated on for conjunctival melanoma. After two years the disease progressed quickly and cutaneous nodes appeared on the back and paraumbilical region. Physical and radiological examination showed a breast mass. No palpable lymph's nodes were noted. She underwent an open biopsy. Histopathologic examination and immunohistochemistry confirmed breast metastases from melanoma. During post-operative staging multiple nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal lesions were also objective. The patient was given palliative dacarbazine (250 mg/m2 per day for 4 days) for 4 cycles. She died 4 months after the diagnosis of breast metastases. CONCLUSION: Histopathological evaluation should be mandatory in patients with medical history of malignancies in order to differentiate new primary tumors, metastases, and benign tumors.","['Kharmoum, Saoussane', 'Mohamed, Mesmoudi', 'Benhammane, Hafida', 'Kharmoum, Jinane', 'Touri, Salima', 'Setti, Khadija', 'Bensouda, Youssef', 'Boutayeb, Saber', 'Elghissassi, Ibrahim', 'Mrabti, Hind', 'El Khannoussi, Bassma', 'Sbitti, Yassir', 'Errihani, Hassan']","['Kharmoum S', 'Mohamed M', 'Benhammane H', 'Kharmoum J', 'Touri S', 'Setti K', 'Bensouda Y', 'Boutayeb S', 'Elghissassi I', 'Mrabti H', 'El Khannoussi B', 'Sbitti Y', 'Errihani H']","['Departement of Medical Oncology, National Institute of Oncology, Poste Madinat al Irfane, Rabat BP 6213, Morocco. saoussane.oncomed@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140909,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/drug therapy/*secondary', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/chemistry/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Dacarbazine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Melanoma/chemistry/drug therapy/*secondary', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Palliative Care', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-0500-7-621 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-7-621 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2014 Sep 9;7:621. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-7-621.,,,PMC4177703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) replication relies on the clonal expansion of its host CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, yet this virus causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) that typically has a CD4(+) phenotype. The viral oncoprotein Tax, which is rarely expressed in ATLL cells, has long been recognized for its involvement in tumor initiation by promoting cell proliferation, genetic instability, and miRNA dysregulation. Meanwhile, HBZ is expressed in both untransformed infected cells and ATLL cells and is involved in sustaining cell proliferation and silencing virus expression. Here, we show that an HBZ-miRNA axis promotes cell proliferation and genetic instability, as indicated by comet assays that showed increased numbers of DNA-strand breaks. Expression profiling of miRNA revealed that infected CD4(+) cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, overexpressed oncogenic miRNAs, including miR17 and miR21. HBZ activated these miRNAs via a posttranscriptional mechanism. These effects were alleviated by knocking down miR21 or miR17 and by ectopic expression of OBFC2A, a DNA-damage factor that is downregulated by miR17 and miR21 in HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells. These findings extend the oncogenic potential of HBZ and suggest that viral expression might be involved in the remarkable genetic instability of ATLL cells.","['Vernin, Celine', 'Thenoz, Morgan', 'Pinatel, Christiane', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Delfau-Larue, Marie-Helene', 'Nazaret, Nicolas', 'Legras-Lachuer, Catherine', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Mortreux, Franck']","['Vernin C', 'Thenoz M', 'Pinatel C', 'Gessain A', 'Gout O', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Nazaret N', 'Legras-Lachuer C', 'Wattel E', 'Mortreux F']","['Universite de Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5239, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Universite de Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5239, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lyon, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Paris, France."", 'Fondation Rothschild, Service de Neurologie, Paris, France.', ""CHU Henri Mondor, Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Creteil, France."", 'Universite Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Lyon, ISPBL Viroscan3D-Profilexpert, UMR5557, Ecologie Microbienne, Lyon, France.', 'Universite Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Lyon, ISPBL Viroscan3D-Profilexpert, UMR5557, Ecologie Microbienne, Lyon, France.', ""Universite de Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5239, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France.

We tested whether DNMT3B expression, measured by NanoString nCounter assay, associates with outcome, gene and microRNA expression and DNA methylation profiles in 210 older (60 years) adults with primary, cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Patients were dichotomized into high versus low expressers using median cut. Outcomes were assessed in the context of known CN-AML prognosticators. Gene and microRNA expression, and DNA methylation profiles were analyzed using microarrays and MethylCap-sequencing, respectively. High DNMT3B expressers had fewer complete remissions (CR; P=0.002) and shorter disease-free (DFS; P=0.02) and overall (OS; P<0.001) survival. In multivariable analyses, high DNMT3B expression remained an independent predictor of lower CR rates (P=0.04) and shorter DFS (P=0.04) and OS (P=0.001). High DNMT3B expression associated with a gene expression profile comprising 363 genes involved in differentiation, proliferation and survival pathways, but with only four differentially expressed microRNAs (miR-133b, miR-148a, miR-122, miR-409-3p) and no differential DNA methylation regions. We conclude that high DNMT3B expression independently associates with adverse outcome in older CN-AML patients. Gene expression analyses suggest that DNMT3B is involved in the modulation of several genes, although the regulatory mechanisms remain to be investigated to devise therapeutic approaches specific for these patients.","['Niederwieser, C', 'Kohlschmidt, J', 'Volinia, S', 'Whitman, S P', 'Metzeler, K H', 'Eisfeld, A-K', 'Maharry, K', 'Yan, P', 'Frankhouser, D', 'Becker, H', 'Schwind, S', 'Carroll, A J', 'Nicolet, D', 'Mendler, J H', 'Curfman, J P', 'Wu, Y-Z', 'Baer, M R', 'Powell, B L', 'Kolitz, J E', 'Moore, J O', 'Carter, T H', 'Bundschuh, R', 'Larson, R A', 'Stone, R M', 'Mrozek, K', 'Marcucci, G', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Niederwieser C', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Volinia S', 'Whitman SP', 'Metzeler KH', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Maharry K', 'Yan P', 'Frankhouser D', 'Becker H', 'Schwind S', 'Carroll AJ', 'Nicolet D', 'Mendler JH', 'Curfman JP', 'Wu YZ', 'Baer MR', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Moore JO', 'Carter TH', 'Bundschuh R', 'Larson RA', 'Stone RM', 'Mrozek K', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', '1] The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', '1] The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', '1] The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Monter Cancer Center, Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Lake Success, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Departments of Physics and Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140910,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014267 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.267 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):567-75. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.267.

In the CR-AML group, 32 patients displayed minimal residual disease (MRDpos). Estimated 5-year overall survival (5-OS) and disease-free survival of all patients was 37% and 29%, respectively. The 5-OS was significantly different between patients with CR-AML and NR-AML (46% vs. 18%). However, pre-transplant MRD status did not affect 5-OS (51% in MRDneg vs. 41% in MRDpos). Using multivariate analysis, we identified patient's physical condition and risk stratification as additional prognostic factors.

Oncogenic mutations in NRAS gene have been observed with variable prevalence in hematopoietic malignancies. In the present study, NRAS mutations were detected using bidirectional sequencing in 264 acute leukemia cases--129 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 135 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 245 age- and gender-matched controls. Missense mutation was observed only in the 12th codon of NRAS gene in 4.7% of AML and 3.16% of ALL cases. The presence of NRAS mutation did not significantly influence blast % and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in AML patients. When the data were analyzed with respect to clinical variables, the total leukocyte count was elevated for mutation positive group, compared to negative group. In AML patients with NRAS mutations, 60% failed to achieve complete remission (CR), as compared to 34.8% in mutation negative group. These results indicated that NRAS mutations might confer poor drug response. In AML, disease free survival (DFS) in NRAS mutation positive group was lesser, compared to mutation negative group (9.5 months vs. 11.68 months). In ALL patients, DFS of NRAS mutation positive group was lesser than mutation negative group (9.2 months vs. 27.5 months). The CR rate was also lower for mutation-positive patients group, compared to mutation-negative group. In conclusion, these results suggested that presence of NRAS mutation at 12th codon was associated with poor response and poorer DFS in both ALL and AML.","['Dunna, Nageswara Rao', 'Vuree, Sugunakar', 'Anuradha, Cingeetham', 'Sailaja, Kagita', 'Surekha, Damineni', 'Digumarti, Raghunadha Rao', 'Rao, V R', 'Yadav, Satish Kumar', 'Reddy, Rajasekhar', 'Vishnupriya, Satti']","['Dunna NR', 'Vuree S', 'Anuradha C', 'Sailaja K', 'Surekha D', 'Digumarti RR', 'Rao VR', 'Yadav SK', 'Reddy R', 'Vishnupriya S']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Indian J Biochem Biophys,Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics,0310774,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/09/11 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/09/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Indian J Biochem Biophys. 2014 Jun;51(3):207-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURES: Given the promising phase 2 data, limited toxicities observed, and the known clinical activities of cytarabine/daunorubicin, we assessed the efficacy of CPX-351 against a panel of childhood ALL xenograft models. Plasma pharmacokinetics of cytarabine and daunorubicin following CPX-351 treatment were determined by HPLC in order to correlate efficacy with drug exposure. RESULTS: CPX-351, at a dose of 5 units/kg (corresponding to 5 mg/kg cytarabine and 2.2 mg/kg daunorubicin), was highly efficacious against all xenografts tested, inducing complete responses in four B-lineage xenografts and partial response in one T-lineage xenograft. These therapeutic responses were achieved with CPX-351 doses that provided drug exposures (based on Cmax and AUC) comparable to those observed in patients with AML. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CPX-351 may be a promising chemotherapeutic to be utilized in the treatment of ALL and support its testing in pediatric patients with leukemia.","['Carol, Hernan', 'Fan, Mannie M Y', 'Harasym, Troy O', 'Boehm, Ingrid', 'Mayer, Lawrence D', 'Houghton, Peter', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Carol H', 'Fan MM', 'Harasym TO', 'Boehm I', 'Mayer LD', 'Houghton P', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140909,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['CPX-351', 'acute leukemia', 'efficacy', 'pharmacokinetics', 'synergy']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25133 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jan;62(1):65-71. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25133.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the control gene GUS to identify relevant thresholds for known therapeutic decision levels (BCR-ABL1/ABL1IS = 10% and 0.1%). We then defined the most relevant cut-offs for early molecular response markers (transcript level at 3 months, halving time and log reduction between diagnosis and 3 months of treatment) using GUS or ABL1. We demonstrated that, although both control genes could be used (in an equivalent way) to accurately assess early molecular response, the BCR-ABL1/GUS level at diagnosis is impacted by the higher GUS copy number over-expressed in CML cells, thus negatively impacting its ability to completely replace ABL1 at diagnosis. Furthermore, we pointed out, for the first time, that it would be helpful to monitor BCR-ABL1 levels at an earlier time point than that currently performed, in order to assess response to first-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and consider a potential switch of therapy as early as possible. We evaluated this optimal time point as being 19 days after the start of treatment in our cohort.","['Huet, Sarah', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Heiblig, Mael', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Gazzo, Sophie', 'Belhabri, Amine', 'Souche, Denis', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Magaud, Jean-Pierre', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Nicolini, Franck']","['Huet S', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Heiblig M', 'Tigaud I', 'Gazzo S', 'Belhabri A', 'Souche D', 'Michallet M', 'Magaud JP', 'Hayette S', 'Nicolini F']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre de Biologie Sud, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France; Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Faculte de medecine Lyon Sud, Oullins, France."", ""Service clinique d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier d'Annecy, Pringy, France."", ""Service clinique d'hematologie 1G, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre de Biologie Sud, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre de Biologie Sud, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Service clinique d'hematologie, Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer Leon Berard, Lyon, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre de Biologie Sud, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Service clinique d'hematologie 1G, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre de Biologie Sud, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France; Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Faculte de medecine Lyon Sud, Oullins, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre de Biologie Sud, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France; Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Faculte de medecine Lyon Sud, Oullins, France."", ""Service clinique d'hematologie 1G, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140909,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucuronidase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0106250 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-14711 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 9;9(9):e106250. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106250. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4159116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wogonin (5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone) is one of the active components of flavonoids that extracts from Scutellariae radix. Several previous studies reported that wogonin possesses antitumor effect against leukemia, gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer. In this study, we used melanoma cell B16-F10 to further investigate the anti-invasive and anti-migratory activity of wogonin. Our date showed that wogonin caused suppression of cell migration, adhesion, invasion and actin remodeling by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and Rac1 in vitro. Wogonin also reduced the number of the tumor nodules on the whole surface of the lung in vivo. Furthermore, the examination of mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited Extracellular Regulated protein Kinases and Protein Kinase B pathways, which are both medicated by Ras. Insulin-like growth factor-1-induced or tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced invasion was also inhibited by wogonin. Therefore, the inhibitory mechanism of melanoma cell invasion by wogonin might be elucidated.","['Zhao, Kai', 'Wei, Libin', 'Hui, Hui', 'Dai, Qinsheng', 'You, Qi-Dong', 'Guo, Qing-Long', 'Lu, Na']","['Zhao K', 'Wei L', 'Hui H', 'Dai Q', 'You QD', 'Guo QL', 'Lu N']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140909,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/pathology', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0106458 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-06607 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 9;9(9):e106458. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106458. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4159230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated 3 recently discovered proteins expressed in the germinal centers of lymph nodes (LMO2, GCET1, and HGAL) in a compilation of leukemia, lymphoma, and thymic tumor entities. Altogether, 1590 cases (1519 on tissue microarrays, 71 on conventional slides) were included. Expressions of LMO2, GCET1, and HGAL were investigated by immunohistochemistry, evaluated for their differential diagnostic relevance, and correlated with the clinical outcome of patients. In Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), the expression of LMO2, GCET1, and HGAL could be largely seen in tumor cells of nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL) but only occasionally in classic HL. The majority of B-cell lymphoma cases was positive for LMO2 [except for Burkitt lymphoma (BL)] and HGAL with weaker to moderate staining intensity, compared with the intensely staining follicular lymphomas (FL). Except for FL (60% of cases) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL, 36% of cases), all other B-cell lymphomas expressed little or no GCET1. In thymomas, the non-neoplastic immature T-cells were LMO2-negative, whereas the neoplastic lymphoblasts were LMO2-positive in more than half of the lymphoblastic lymphomas (LBL). Our findings provide new potential assistance in the differential diagnosis of FL to marginal zone lymphoma, classic HL to NLPHL and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL to BL, and thymoma to LBL. Finally, HGAL proved to be a prognostic marker for classic HL regarding the background population and in DLBCL regarding the tumor cells.","['Menter, Thomas', 'Gasser, Anjes', 'Juskevicius, Darius', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Tzankov, Alexandar']","['Menter T', 'Gasser A', 'Juskevicius D', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GCSAM protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SERPINA9 protein, human)', '0 (Serpins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Germinal Center/metabolism/pathology', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*metabolism', '*Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Serpins/*metabolism', '*Thymus Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000107 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2015 Aug;23(7):491-8. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cure rate of this disease is over 80% in developed countries utilizing protocols with very tolerable toxicity. Several factors contributed to this success, including the implementation of large collaborative clinical trials and the better understanding of disease biology allowing for risk-stratified treatment. We will review the current state of the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in low-income and medium-income countries. RECENT FINDINGS: The picture differs from country to country, but recent advances have been made in many countries and the cure rates have improved significantly. Tackling problems such as access to care, abandonment of treatment and toxicity of protocols and the development of centers of excellence are critical for continued improvement. Twinning with programs in developed countries and the creation of regional collaborative groups will allow the implementation of risk-directed therapy and better supportive care. SUMMARY: The experience in low-income countries shows that a structured approach to the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia results in improved survival.","['Abboud, Miguel R', 'Ghanem, Khaled', 'Muwakkit, Samar']","['Abboud MR', 'Ghanem K', 'Muwakkit S']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Child', 'Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Healthcare Disparities/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/07/16 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000125 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2014 Nov;26(6):650-5. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Health risk and stress posed by benzene have long been a concern because of the carcinogenic effects of the compound which was classified as a Group 1 carcinogen to humans and animals. There is a close correlation between leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemia, and benzene exposure. In addition, exposure to benzene can cause harmful effects on immunological, neurological, and reproductive systems. Benzene can directly damage hematopoietic progenitor cells, which in turn could lead to apoptosis or may decrease responsiveness to cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules. Alternatively, benzene toxicity to stromal cells or mature blood cells could disrupt the regulation of hematopoiesis, including hematopoietic commitment, maturation, or mobilization, through the network of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Today there is mounting evidence that benzene may alter the gene expression, production, or processing of several cytokines in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this review was to systematically analyze the published cases of cytokine effects on human benzene exposure, particularly hematotoxicity, and atopy, and on lungs.","['Minciullo, Paola Lucia', 'Navarra, Michele', 'Calapai, Gioacchino', 'Gangemi, Sebastiano']","['Minciullo PL', 'Navarra M', 'Calapai G', 'Gangemi S']","['Operative Unit of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy ; Policlinico Universitario, Via Consolare Valeria, 98125 Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Drug Sciences and Products for Health, University of Messina, 98158 Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.', 'Operative Unit of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy ; Institute of Clinical Physiology, IFC CNR, Messina Unit, 98125 Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140818,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects/toxicity', 'Cytokines/blood/*metabolism', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects/toxicity', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/etiology', 'Lung/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/937987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol Res. 2014;2014:937987. doi: 10.1155/2014/937987.

However, liver tumors often acquire radioresistance, which contributes to RT failure. The exact mechanisms of the radioresistance in hepatoma cells are largely unknown. Glutathione S-transferase M3 (GSTM3) is a phase II transferase, however, recent studies have suggested that GSTM3 is a potential tumor suppressor. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of GSTM3 in reversing radioresistance, and to explore the molecular mechanism of this in the human radiation-resistant PRF/PLC/5R hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. The radioresistant PLC/PRF/5R cells were used as cell model, and were derived from PLC/PRF/5 parental cells using fractionated irradiation. The radiosensitivity of the cells was tested by clonogenic assay and flow cytometry analyses. The expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, p21, p27 and p53 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting with or without radiation. The results showed that the expression levels of GSTM3 were significantly lower in the PLC/PRF/5R cells than in the PLC/PRF/5 parental cells. GSTM3 overexpression sensitized the PLC/PRF/5R cells to radiation mainly though induction of apoptosis. According to the evidence from Annexin-V/PI staining, it markedly increased the percentage of apoptotic PRF/PLC/5R cells. The clonogenic assay indicated that GSTM3 significantly decreased the RT survival fraction in PRF/PLC/5R cells. Furthermore, GSTM3 increased the expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bax, p21, p27 and p53) in PRF/PLC/5R cells with irradiation. These findings suggest that GSTM3 plays an pivotal role in reversing the radioresistance of HCC and may be a potential target for sensitizing HCC cells to RT. The underlying mechanisms may be linked to the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis facilitation.","['Sun, Ying', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yin, Yufeng', 'Chen, Xianghua', 'Sun, Zhijun']","['Sun Y', 'Wang Y', 'Yin Y', 'Chen X', 'Sun Z']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Shandong Medical College, Jinan, Shandong 250002, P.R.

Natural killer (NK) cells are able to kill malignant cells by receiving activation signal from the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) recognizing HLA molecules on a cancer cell. It has been recently reported that the risk of relapse in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is reduced in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients whose donors have several activating KIR genes or KIR B-motifs in unrelated donor setting, obviously due to enhanced GvL effect by NK cells. We studied the effect on relapse rate of donor KIR haplotypes in the HLA-identical adult sibling HSCT, done in a single center, in Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. Altogether, 134 patients with 6 different diagnoses were identified. Their donors were KIR genotyped using the Luminex and the SSP techniques. The clinical endpoint, that is, occurrence of relapse, was compared with the presence or absence of single KIR genes. Also, time from transplantation to relapse was analyzed. The patients with AML whose donors have KIR2DL2 or KIR2DS2 had statistically significantly longer relapse-free survival (P = 0.015). Our data support previous reports that donors with KIR B-haplotype defining genes have a lower occurrence of relapse in HSCT of AML patients. Determination of donor KIR haplotypes could be a useful addition for a risk assessment of HSCT especially in AML patients.","['Impola, Ulla', 'Turpeinen, Hannu', 'Alakulppi, Noora', 'Linjama, Tiina', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Partanen, Jukka', 'Koskela, Satu']","['Impola U', 'Turpeinen H', 'Alakulppi N', 'Linjama T', 'Volin L', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Partanen J', 'Koskela S']","['FRC Blood Service, Research and Development , Helsinki , Finland.', 'Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology (BioMediTech), University of Tampere , Tampere , Finland.', 'FRC Blood Service, Research and Development , Helsinki , Finland.', 'FRC Blood Service, Research and Development , Helsinki , Finland.', 'Division of Hematology, Helsinki University Central Hospital , Helsinki , Finland.', 'Division of Hematology, Helsinki University Central Hospital , Helsinki , Finland.', 'FRC Blood Service, Research and Development , Helsinki , Finland.', 'FRC Blood Service, Research and Development , Helsinki , Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140825,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA', 'KIR', 'NK cells', 'graft versus tumor effect', 'transplantation immunology']",2014/09/10 06:00,2014/09/10 06:01,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00405 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Aug 25;5:405. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00405. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4142321,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both agents show cytotoxicity toward T-cell malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of forodesine in vitro using ara-G-resistant leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T-Lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM and ara-G-resistant CEM variant cell line CEM/ara-G that we had previously established were used. RESULTS: A growth-inhibition assay demonstrated that CEM cells were insensitive to single-agent forodesine treatment. The cells were also insensitive to deoxyguanosine at a maximal concentration of 10 muM. CEM/ara-G cells were 80-fold more resistant to ara-G than were CEM cells, and the mode of sensitivity to forodesine and deoxyguanosine was similar to that of CEM cells. In the presence of 10 muM deoxyguanosine, forodesine effectively inhibited the growth of CEM cells but not that of CEM/ara-G cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed that combination of forodesine and deoxyguanosine induced apoptosis of CEM cells but not of CEM/ara-G cells. The addition of ara-G did not augment the cytotoxicity of the forodesine/deoxyguanosine combination towards CEM cells or CEM/ara-G cells. The combination index revealed antagonism between forodesine and ara-G. The intracellular production of ara-G triphosphate was reduced in the presence of forodesine. CONCLUSION: Nelarabine-resistant CEM/ara-G cells are insensitive to forodesine.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Uzui, Kanako', 'Nishi, Rie', 'Tasaki, Toshiki', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Uzui K', 'Nishi R', 'Tasaki T', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Fukui, Japan tyamauch@u-fukui.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Fukui, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology/toxicity']",['NOTNLM'],"['Forodesine', 'ara-G', 'ara-GTP', 'deoxyguanosine', 'leukemia', 'nelarabine']",2014/09/10 06:00,2014/11/12 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['34/9/4885 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Sep;34(9):4885-92.,"['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both have been shown to result in electrocardiogram rate-corrected Q-wave T-wave interval (QTc) prolongation in humans and animals. Liposomes have been shown to ameliorate drug-induced effects on the cardiac-delayed rectifier K(+) current (IKr, KV11.1), coded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). This study was undertaken to determine if liposomes would also decrease the effect of crizotinib and nilotinib on the IKr channel. Crizotinib and nilotinib were tested in an in vitro IKr assay using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with the hERG. Dose-responses were determined and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were calculated. When the HEK 293 cells were treated with crizotinib or nilotinib that were mixed with liposomes, there was a significant decrease in the IKr channel inhibitory effects of these two drugs. When isolated, rabbit hearts were exposed to crizotinib or nilotinib, there were significant increases in QTc prolongation. Mixing either of the drugs with liposomes ameliorated the effects of the drugs. Rabbits dosed intravenously (IV) with crizotinib or nilotinib showed QTc prolongation. When liposomes were injected prior to crizotinib or nilotinib, the liposomes decreased the effects on the QTc interval. The use of liposomal encapsulated QT-prolongation agents, or giving liposomes in combination with drugs, may decrease their cardiac liability.","['Shopp, George M', 'Helson, Lawrence', 'Bouchard, Annie', 'Salvail, Dany', 'Majeed, Muhammad']","['Shopp GM', 'Helson L', 'Bouchard A', 'Salvail D', 'Majeed M']","['Shopp Nonclinical Consulting LLC, Boulder, CO, U.S.A.', 'SignPath Pharma, Quakertown, PA, U.S.A lhelson@comcast.net.', 'IPS Therapeutique Inc., Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.', 'IPS Therapeutique Inc., Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.', 'Sabinsa Corporation, East Windsor, NJ, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '53AH36668S (Crizotinib)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Crizotinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Heart Conduction System/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Liposomes', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Rabbits']",['NOTNLM'],"['Crizotinib', 'QT prolongation', 'cardiotoxicity', 'hERG', 'liposomes', 'nilotinib']",2014/09/10 06:00,2014/11/12 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['34/9/4733 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Sep;34(9):4733-40.,"['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by a dramatic expansion of blast-like cells in the hemolymph with high mitotic index. Examination of hemolymph of diseased clams revealed high levels of reverse transcriptase activity, the hallmark of retroviruses and retroelements. By deep sequencing of RNAs from hemolymph, we identified transcripts of a novel retroelement, here named Steamer. The DNA of the element is marked by long terminal repeats and encodes a single large protein with similarity to mammalian retroviral Gag-Pol proteins. Steamer mRNA levels were specifically elevated in diseased hemocytes, and high expression was correlated with disease status. DNA copy number per genome was present at enormously high levels in diseased hemocytes, indicative of extensive reverse transcription and retrotransposition. Steamer activation in M. arenaria is an example of a catastrophic induction of genetic instability that may initiate or advance the course of leukemia.","['Arriagada, Gloria', 'Metzger, Michael J', 'Muttray, Annette F', 'Sherry, James', 'Reinisch, Carol', 'Street, Craig', 'Lipkin, W Ian', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Arriagada G', 'Metzger MJ', 'Muttray AF', 'Sherry J', 'Reinisch C', 'Street C', 'Lipkin WI', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar 2520000, Chile;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;', 'Environment Canada, Water Science & Technology Directorate, Burlington, ON, Canada L7R 4A6; and.', 'Environment Canada, Water Science & Technology Directorate, Burlington, ON, Canada L7R 4A6; and.', 'Environment Canada, Water Science & Technology Directorate, Burlington, ON, Canada L7R 4A6; and.', 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; spg1@columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140908,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Retroelements)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Hemocytes/*metabolism', 'Hemolymph/cytology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mya/cytology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA/genetics', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",['NOTNLM'],"['disseminated neoplasia', 'hemic neoplasia', 'integration', 'mobile genetic element', 'retrotransposon']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1409945111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1409945111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 30;111(39):14175-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409945111.

Ibrutinib is given orally on a continuous schedule and induces durable remissions in the majority of CLL patients. However, a small proportion of patients initially responds to the BTKi and then develops resistance. Estimating the frequency, timing, and individual risk of developing resistance to ibrutinib, therefore, would be valuable for long-term management of patients. Computational evolutionary models, based on measured kinetic parameters of patients, allow us to approach these questions and to develop a roadmap for personalized prognosis and treatment management. Our kinetic models predict that BTKi-resistant mutants exist before initiation of ibrutinib therapy, although they only comprise a minority of the overall tumor burden. Furthermore, we can estimate the time required for resistant cells to grow to detectable levels. We predict that this can be highly variable, depending mostly on growth and death rates of the individual CLL cell clone. For a specific patient, this time can be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Our model can thus be used to predict for how long ibrutinib can suppress the disease in individual patients. Furthermore, the model can suggest whether prior debulking of the tumor with chemo-immunotherapy can prolong progression-free survival under ibrutinib. Finally, by applying the models to data that document progression during ibrutinib therapy, we estimated that resistant mutants might have a small (<2%) mean fitness advantage in the absence of treatment, compared with sensitive cells.","['Komarova, Natalia L', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Wodarz, Dominik']","['Komarova NL', 'Burger JA', 'Wodarz D']","['Department of Mathematics and Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697; and komarova@uci.edu.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Mathematics and Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140908,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', '*Models, Biological', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['drug resistance', 'evolutionary dynamics', 'mathematical models', 'personalized medicine', 'stochastic dynamics']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1409362111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1409362111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 23;111(38):13906-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409362111.

Hematopoietic stem cells are the suspected disease-initiating cells, and these cells must acquire a clonal advantage relative to nonmutant hematopoietic stem cells to perpetuate disease. In 2005, several groups identified a single gain-of-function point mutation in JAK2 that associated with the majority of MPNs, and subsequent studies have led to a comprehensive understanding of the mutational landscape in MPNs. However, confusion still exists as to how a single genetic aberration can be associated with multiple distinct disease entities. Many explanations have been proposed, including JAK2V617F homozygosity, individual patient heterogeneity, and the differential regulation of downstream JAK2 signaling pathways. Several groups have made knock-in mouse models expressing JAK2V617F and have observed divergent phenotypes, each recapitulating some aspects of disease. Intriguingly, most of these models do not observe a strong hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal advantage compared with wild-type littermate controls, raising the question of how a clonal advantage is established in patients with MPNs. This review summarizes the current molecular understanding of MPNs and the diversity of disease phenotypes and proposes that the increased proliferation induced by JAK2V617F applies a selection pressure on the mutant clone that results in highly diverse clonal evolution in individuals.","['Prick, Janine', 'de Haan, Gerald', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Kent, David G']","['Prick J', 'de Haan G', 'Green AR', 'Kent DG']","['Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust/MRC Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Laboratory of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', ""Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust/MRC Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust/MRC Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

In response to nutrients and growth factors, mTORC1 is known to control cellular growth by regulating the translational regulators S6 kinase 1 and 4E binding protein 1, whereas mTORC2 mediates cell proliferation and survival by activating Akt through phosphorylation at Ser473. Studies have shown that the deregulation of mTORC2 leads to the development of myeloproliferative disorder and leukemia in the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)-deleted mouse model. However, the mechanism by which mTORC2 specifically affects leukemogenesis is still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of mTORC2 in NOTCH1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in a Rictor-deficient mouse model. We found that, by deleting Rictor, an essential component of mTORC2, leukemia progression was significantly suppressed by arresting a greater proportion of Rictor( big up tri, open/ big up tri, open) leukemic cells at the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the absence of Rictor led to the overexpression of chemotaxis-related genes, such as CCR2, CCR4 and CXCR4, which contributed to the homing and migration of Rictor-deficient T-ALL cells to the spleen but not the bone marrow. In addition, we demonstrated that inactivation of mTORC2 caused the overexpression of forkhead box O3 and its downstream effectors and eased the progression of leukemia in T-ALL mice. Our study thus indicates that forkhead box O3 could be a potential drug target for the treatment of T-ALL leukemia.","['Hua, Chunlan', 'Guo, Huidong', 'Bu, Jiachen', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Cheng, Hui', 'He, Fuhong', 'Wang, Jinhong', 'Wang, Xiaomin', 'Zhang, Yinchi', 'Wang, Qianfei', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Yuan, Weiping']","['Hua C', 'Guo H', 'Bu J', 'Zhou M', 'Cheng H', 'He F', 'Wang J', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang Q', 'Zhou J', 'Cheng T', 'Xu M', 'Yuan W']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

A large majority of CIK cells are CD3(+)CD56(+), and this population has been shown to confer a cytotoxic effect against tumor targets. The scope of this work was to study whether CD56 has a direct role in CIK-mediated cytotoxicity. Blocking of CD56 with the anti-CD56 monoclonal antibody GPR165 significantly reduced CIK-mediated lysis of three CD56(+) hematopoietic tumor cell lines (AML-NS8, NB4, and KCL22), whereas no effect was observed on three CD56(-) hematopoietic tumor cell lines (K562, REH, and MOLT-4). Knockdown of CD56 in CIK cells by short interfering RNA made the cells less cytotoxic against a CD56(+) target, and knockdown of CD56 in target cells with lentiviral short hairpin RNA significantly altered their susceptibility to CIK-mediated lysis. Our data suggest that homophilic interaction between CD56 molecules may occur in tumor-cell recognition, leading to CIK-mediated cell death.","['Valgardsdottir, Rut', 'Capitanio, Cristina', 'Texido, Gemma', 'Pende, Daniela', 'Cantoni, Claudia', 'Pesenti, Enrico', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Golay, Josee', 'Introna, Martino']","['Valgardsdottir R', 'Capitanio C', 'Texido G', 'Pende D', 'Cantoni C', 'Pesenti E', 'Rambaldi A', 'Golay J', 'Introna M']","['USS Centre of Cellular Therapy ""G.Lanzani"", USC Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, A.O.

Adriamycin (ADM), an anthracycline antibiotic, is widely applied in the chemotherapy for leukemia; however, it has a side effect of heart damage. This study aims to explore potential anti-leukemia effects of quercetin (Que) and the underlying mechanism. Methods The P388 xenograft mice models were first established and then treated with Que alone or in combination with ADM. Subsequently, we evaluated their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis by observing the cell cycle and detecting the Caspase-3 level, respectively. The underlying pro-apoptotic mechanism was further investigated by detecting the expression levels of NF-kappaB, Bcl-2, and Bax. The cardiomyocyte ultrastructural changes of P388 leukemic mice after drug treatment were also observed. The protective effect of Que on cardiomyocyte was evaluated by detecting enzymatic activity changes of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Results Compared with ADM group, the combination of ADM and Que showed prolonged survival time and less peripheral white blood cells. Que could sensitize the anti-leukemic effect of ADM by inhibiting the proliferation of white blood cells through trapping the cells at the S phase; caspase-3 was activated via the expressional regulation of Bcl-2, Bax, and NF-kappaB. When applied in combination with ADM, Que could attenuate heart damage by cleaning the reactive oxygen species. Conclusion Our study may provide informative evidences for the underlying mechanism of anti-cancer effects of Que and sheds light on the clinical application of Que in leukemia treatment.","['Han, Yanqiu', 'Yu, Hong', 'Wang, Junrui', 'Ren, Yanzhen', 'Su, Xiulan', 'Shi, Yingxu']","['Han Y', 'Yu H', 'Wang J', 'Ren Y', 'Su X', 'Shi Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140909,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adriamycin', 'Leukemia', 'Myocyte damage', 'Quercetin', 'Xenograft nude mice']",2014/09/10 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000198 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Jun;20(5):276-83. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000198.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective study in 70 patients on the prevalence and clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA) in SMZL. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nine patients (13%) had the diagnosis of a lupus anticoagulant (LA). The occurrence of venous thromboembolic events was significantly higher in LA positive patients compared to LA negative patients (4/9 [44%] vs 5/61 [8%], p = 0.002), especially within 12 months after splenectomy (3/6 [50%] vs 2/28 [7%], p = 0.007). None of the patients with LA had a persistent complete remission of LA after splenectomy, but complete remission of LA was achieved in 2/2 patients after rituximab-bendamustine immuno-chemotherapy. In conclusion, our data show a relatively high prevalence of aPLA in SMZL and an increased risk of postsplenectomy thrombosis in these patients. The fact that rituximab-bendamustine was effective for eradicating LA may be considered as an argument for using immuno-chemotherapy as first line therapy in SMZL patients with LA.","['Gebhart, J', 'Lechner, K', 'Skrabs, C', 'Sliwa, T', 'Muldur, E', 'Ludwig, H', 'Nosslinger, T', 'Vanura, K', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Simonitsch-Klupp, I', 'Chott, A', 'Quehenberger, P', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, G', 'Pabinger, I', 'Jager, U', 'Geissler, K']","['Gebhart J', 'Lechner K', 'Skrabs C', 'Sliwa T', 'Muldur E', 'Ludwig H', 'Nosslinger T', 'Vanura K', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Simonitsch-Klupp I', 'Chott A', 'Quehenberger P', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Pabinger I', 'Jager U', 'Geissler K']","['Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '5thDepartment of Medicine, Krankenhaus Hietzing, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminenspital Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminenspital Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department for Hematology and Oncology and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Hematology Department, G.

This may identify conserved oncogenic pathways and potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: We applied an immunoaffinity/mass spectrometry workflow to three mouse models: murine stem cell virus-Neu, expressing truncated Neu, the rat orthologue of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Her2 (HER2); mouse mammary tumour virus-polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT); and the p53-/- transplant model (p53). Pathways and protein-protein interaction networks were identified by bioinformatics analysis. Molecular mechanisms underpinning differences in tyrosine phosphorylation were characterised by Western blot analysis and array comparative genomic hybridisation. The functional role of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (Met) in a subset of p53-null tumours was interrogated using a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown and cell proliferation assays. RESULTS: The three models could be distinguished on the basis of tyrosine phosphorylation signatures and signalling networks. HER2 tumours exhibited a protein-protein interaction network centred on avian erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (Erbb2), epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, and they displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1. In contrast, the PyMT network displayed significant enrichment for components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway, whereas p53 tumours exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Met and components or regulators of the cytoskeleton and shared signalling network characteristics with basal and claudin-low breast cancer cells. A subset of p53 tumours displayed markedly elevated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and Met expression, as well as Met gene amplification. Treatment of cultured p53-null cells exhibiting Met amplification with a selective Met TKI abrogated aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation and blocked cell proliferation. The effects on proliferation were recapitulated when Met was knocked down using siRNA. Additional subtypes of p53 tumours exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of other oncogenes, including Peak1/SgK269 and Prex2. CONCLUSION: This study provides network-level insights into signalling in the breast cancer models utilised and demonstrates that comparative phosphoproteomics can identify conserved oncogenic signalling pathways. The Met-amplified, p53-null tumours provide a new preclinical model for a subset of triple-negative breast cancers.","['Ali, Naveid A', 'Wu, Jianmin', 'Hochgrafe, Falko', 'Chan, Howard', 'Nair, Radhika', 'Ye, Sunny', 'Zhang, Luxi', 'Lyons, Ruth J', 'Pinese, Mark', 'Lee, Hong Ching', 'Armstrong, Nicola', 'Ormandy, Christopher J', 'Clark, Susan J', 'Swarbrick, Alexander', 'Daly, Roger J']","['Ali NA', 'Wu J', 'Hochgrafe F', 'Chan H', 'Nair R', 'Ye S', 'Zhang L', 'Lyons RJ', 'Pinese M', 'Lee HC', 'Armstrong N', 'Ormandy CJ', 'Clark SJ', 'Swarbrick A', 'Daly RJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140909,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0', '(5-((2,6-dichlorobenzyl)sulfonyl)-3-((3,5-dimethyl-4-((2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)p', 'yrrolidin-1-yl)carbonyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methylene)-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Sulfones)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfones/pharmacology']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['s13058-014-0437-3 [pii]', '10.1186/s13058-014-0437-3 [doi]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2014 Sep 9;16(5):437. doi: 10.1186/s13058-014-0437-3.,,,PMC4303118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-CML therapy has been much improved along with the applications of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which selectively target Bcr-Abl and have a cytotoxic effect on CML. Recently, four-membered heterocycles as ""compact modules"" have attracted much interest in drug discovery. Grafting these small four-membered heterocycles onto a molecular scaffold could probably provide compounds that retain notable activity and populate chemical space otherwise not previously accessed. Accordingly, a novel TKI, Thiotanib, has been designed and synthesized. It selectively targets Bcr-Abl, inducing growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of CML cells. Meanwhile, the compound Thiotanib could also induce autophagy in CML cells. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy promotes Thiotanib-induced apoptosis with no further activation of caspase 3, while inhibition of caspases did not affect the cell survival of CML cells.

We wanted to compare long-term AML cell proliferation for unselected patients, investigate the influence of endothelial cells on AML cell proliferation and identify biological characteristics associated with clonogenic capacity. METHODS: Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with recombinant growth factors FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand, stem cell factor, IL-3, G-CSF and thrombopoietin. The colony-forming unit assay was used to estimate the number of progenitors in AML cell populations after 35 days of culture, and microarray was used to study global gene expression profiles between AML patients. RESULTS: Long-term cell proliferation was observed in 7 of 31 patients, whereas 3 additional patients showed long-term proliferation after endothelial cell coculture. Patient-specific differences in constitutive cytokine release were maintained during cell culture. Patients with long-term proliferation showed altered expression in six cell cycle-related genes (HMMR, BUB1, NUSAP1, AURKB, CCNF, DLGAP5), two genes involved in DNA replication (TOP2A, RFC3) and one gene with unknown function (LHFPL2). CONCLUSION: We identified a subset of AML patients characterized by long-term in vitro cell proliferation and altered expression of cell cycle regulators that may be potential candidates for treatment of AML.","['Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Hatfield KJ', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['University of Bergen, Department of Clinical Science , Bergen , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140909,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell cycle', 'colony-forming unit assay', 'cytokines', 'endothelial cells', 'progenitor cells']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2014.957671 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2014 Nov;18(11):1237-51. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2014.957671.

Blacks and Hispanics had the highest toxoplasmosis mortality compared with whites. Several medical conditions were associated with toxoplasmosis deaths, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lymphoma, leukemia, and connective tissue disorders. The number of toxoplasmosis deaths with an HIV codiagnosis declined from 2000 to 2010; the numbers without such a codiagnosis remained static. Cumulative disease-related productivity losses for the 11-year period were nearly $815 million.

The impact of TET2 mutation on survival outcomes is still controversial; however, functional studies have proved that it is a loss-of-function mutation that impairs myeloid cell differentiation and contributes to the phenotype of myeloid neoplasia. We, herein, aimed to investigate TET2 expression in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A significantly decreased TET2 expression was observed in bone marrow cells from AML (n = 53) and patients with MDS (n = 64), compared to normal donors (n = 22). In MDS, TET2 expression was significantly reduced in RAEB-1/RAEB-2 compared to other WHO 2008 classifications, and a lower TET2 expression was observed at the time of MDS disease progression in four of five patients. In multivariate analysis, low TET2 expression (P = 0.03), male gender (P = 0.02), and WHO 2008 classification (P < 0.0001) were independent predictors of poorer overall survival. These results suggest that defective TET2 expression plays a role in the MDS pathophysiology and predicts survival outcomes in this disease.","['Scopim-Ribeiro, Renata', 'Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Campos, Paula de Melo', 'Silva, Cleide Aparecida Moreira', 'Favaro, Patricia', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene', 'Costa, Fernando Ferreira', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla', 'Traina, Fabiola']","['Scopim-Ribeiro R', 'Machado-Neto JA', 'Campos Pde M', 'Silva CA', 'Favaro P', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Costa FF', 'Saad ST', 'Traina F']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141001,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'ten-eleven-translocation 2']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/09/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12445 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 May;94(5):413-8. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12445.

In addition, beta-catenin is necessary in Nanog-dependent conversion of preinduced pluripotent stem cells (pre-iPSCs) into iPSCs. The activation of beta-catenin by Nanog causes fluctuations of beta-catenin in ESCs cultured in serum plus leukemia inhibitory factor (serum+LIF) medium, in which protein levels of key pluripotency factors are heterogeneous. In 2i+LIF medium, which favors propagation of ESCs in a ground state of pluripotency with many pluripotency genes losing mosaic expression, we show Nanog-independent beta-catenin fluctuations. Overall, we demonstrate Nanog and beta-catenin cooperation in establishing naive pluripotency during the reprogramming process and their correlated heterogeneity in ESCs primed toward differentiation.","['Marucci, Lucia', 'Pedone, Elisa', 'Di Vicino, Umberto', 'Sanuy-Escribano, Blanca', 'Isalan, Mark', 'Cosma, Maria Pia']","['Marucci L', 'Pedone E', 'Di Vicino U', 'Sanuy-Escribano B', 'Isalan M', 'Cosma MP']","['Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Spain; Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1UB, UK.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.

Reduced miR-146a expression in del(5q) HR MDS/AML and miR-146a(-/-) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in TRAF6/NF-kappaB activation. Increased survival and proliferation of HSPCs from miR-146a(low) HR MDS/AML is sustained by a neighboring haploid gene, SQSTM1 (p62), expressed from the intact 5q allele. Overexpression of p62 from the intact allele occurs through NF-kappaB-dependent feedforward signaling mediated by miR-146a deficiency. p62 is necessary for TRAF6-mediated NF-kappaB signaling, as disrupting the p62-TRAF6 signaling complex results in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of MDS/AML cells. Thus, del(5q) HR MDS/AML employs an intrachromosomal gene network involving loss of miR-146a and haploid overexpression of p62 via NF-kappaB to sustain TRAF6/NF-kappaB signaling for cell survival and proliferation. Interfering with the p62-TRAF6 signaling complex represents a therapeutic option in miR-146a-deficient and aggressive del(5q) MDS/AML.","['Fang, Jing', 'Barker, Brenden', 'Bolanos, Lyndsey', 'Liu, Xiaona', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Christie, Susanne', 'Chen, Xiaoting', 'Rao, Dinesh S', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Komurov, Kakajan', 'Weirauch, Matthew T', 'Cancelas, Jose A', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Starczynowski, Daniel T']","['Fang J', 'Barker B', 'Bolanos L', 'Liu X', 'Jerez A', 'Makishima H', 'Christie S', 'Chen X', 'Rao DS', 'Grimes HL', 'Komurov K', 'Weirauch MT', 'Cancelas JA', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Starczynowski DT']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology (CAGE), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computing Systems, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology (CAGE), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Divisions of Biomedical Informatics and Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Hoxworth Blood Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA."", 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases, which eventually result in leukemic transformation (acute myelogenous leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes, AML-MRC). However, the precise components and functions of the MDS niche remain unclear. Recently, CXCL12-abundant reticular cells were shown to act as a hematopoietic stem cell niche in the murine bone marrow. Using immunohistochemistry, we show here that CXCL12(+) cells were located in the cellular marrow or perivascular area, and were in contact with CD34(+) hematopoietic cells in control and MDS/AML-MRC bone marrow. MDS bone marrow exhibited higher CXCL12(+) cell density than control or AML, not otherwise specified (AML-NOS) bone marrow. Moreover, AML-MRC bone marrow also exhibited higher CXCL12(+) cell density than control bone marrow. CXCL12(+) cell density correlated positively with bone marrow blast ratio in MDS cases. CXCL12 mRNA level was also higher in MDS bone marrow than in control or AML-NOS bone marrow. In vitro coculture analysis revealed that overexpression of CXCL12 in stromal cells upregulated BCL-2 expression of leukemia cell lines. Triple immunostaining revealed that the CD34(+) hematopoietic cells of MDS bone marrow in contact with CXCL12(+) cells were BCL-2-positive and TUNEL-negative. In the bone marrow of MDS cases, CXCL12-high group showed significantly higher Bcl-2(+)/CD34(+) cell ratio and lower apoptotic cell ratio than CXCL12-low group. Moreover, CXCL12-high refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) cases had a greater tendency to progress to refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEBs) or AML-MRC than CXCL12-low RCMD cases. These results suggest that CXCL12(+) cells constitute the niche for CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, and may be associated with the survival/antiapoptosis of CD34(+) hematopoietic cells and disease progression in MDS. Thus, CXCL12(+) cells may represent a novel MDS therapeutic target.","['Abe-Suzuki, Shiho', 'Kurata, Morito', 'Abe, Shinya', 'Onishi, Iichiroh', 'Kirimura, Susumu', 'Nashimoto, Manami', 'Murayama, Toshihiko', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Abe-Suzuki S', 'Kurata M', 'Abe S', 'Onishi I', 'Kirimura S', 'Nashimoto M', 'Murayama T', 'Hidaka M', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Hospital Organization, Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization, Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140908,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2014/12/31 06:00,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['labinvest2014110 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.2014.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2014 Nov;94(11):1212-23. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2014.110.

Recently recognized as an important transducer and/or integrator of various signals as well as a protein-protein interaction scaffold forming receptor complexes with signaling properties, the most prominent pharmacological role of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitors is the increase of myocardial contractility in pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure. Consequently, modulators of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase such as digoxin have been approved by regulatory authorities and are widely used in the treatment of cardiac failure since 1975. Initiating from early observations of reduction of cancer incidence in cardiac patients taking digoxin, recent epidemiological and other studies have consolidated the anti-cancer potential of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitors in indications such as prostate, breast, lung cancer or leukemia. More importantly, a new series of pharmacologically optimized Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitors has recently shown strong anti-cancer activities in multiple preclinical assays and have reached early clinical trials. Altogether, these results suggest that Na(+)/K(+) ATPase is an emerging cancer target that merits further investigation. In this review, we summarize key functional properties of the enzyme that are highly relevant for cancer cell selectivity, review the most prominent chemical classes of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitors and analyze their downstream effectors.

Selenite induced phosphorylation of p53 at the vital site Ser15 via p38MAPK and ERK. Subsequently p53 dissociated with its inhibitory protein mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). Meanwhile, the nucleolar protein B23 transferred from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and associated with MDM2, probably stabilizing p53. The active p53 participated in the decrease of autophagic protein Beclin-1 and LC-3, as well as activation of apoptosis-related caspases.

The effect of two clinically used kinase inhibitors, imatinib (a relatively specific c-ABL inhibitor) and dasatinib (dual ABL/SRC family kinase inhibitor), on cell binding to fibronectin is described. Both imatinib and low-dose (several nM) dasatinib reinforced CML cell interaction with fibronectin while no significant change was induced in BCR-ABL-negative cells. On the other hand, clinically relevant doses of dasatinib (100 nM) had almost no effect in CML cells. The efficiency of the inhibitors in blocking the activity of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases was assessed from the extent of phosphorylation at autophosphorylation sites. In both CML cell lines, SRC kinases were found to be transactivated by BCR-ABL. In the intracellular context, EC50 for BCR-ABL inhibition was in subnanomolar range for dasatinib and in submicromolar one for imatinib. EC50 for direct inhibition of LYN kinase was found to be about 20 nM for dasatinib and more than 10 microM for imatinib. Cells pretreated with 100 nM dasatinib were still able to bind to fibronectin and SRC kinases are thus not necessary for the formation of cell-matrix contacts. However, a minimal activity of SRC kinases might be required to mediate the increase in cell adhesivity induced by BCR-ABL inhibition. Indeed, active (autophosphorylated) LYN was found to localize in cell adhesive structures which were visualized using interference reflection microscopy.","['Obr, Adam', 'Roselova, Pavla', 'Grebenova, Dana', 'Kuzelova, Katerina']","['Obr A', 'Roselova P', 'Grebenova D', 'Kuzelova K']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140908,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0107367 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-23040 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 8;9(9):e107367. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107367. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4157868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to determine the role of selenium on HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. We found that 100 nM of sodium selenite (Se) had no significant effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and the cell cycle; however, a higher concentration of 250 nM of Se significantly inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase after 48 h of treatment (P<0.05), thus demonstrating the anticancer activities of selenium in leukemia. However, the decrease in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) expression by targeting JNK1 using small interfering RNA attenuated the inhibitory effects of Se on cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. Mechanistic studies showed that the anticancer activities of Se were associated with the enhanced phosphorylation of JNK1 and the increased expression of the cell cycle regulators, p21 and p27, as well as the downregulation of cyclin D1. Our data provide further evidence that the appropriate concentration of selenium has therapeutic potential in leukemia.","['Wu, Sun', 'Bao, Yonghua', 'Ma, Dong', 'Zi, Youmei', 'Yang, Cui', 'Yang, Man', 'Xing, Mengtao', 'Yang, Wancai']","['Wu S', 'Bao Y', 'Ma D', 'Zi Y', 'Yang C', 'Yang M', 'Xing M', 'Yang W']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui, Henan, P.R.

Nontraumatic cerebral air embolism cases are rare. We report a case of an air embolism resulting in cerebral infarction related to angioinvasive cavitary aspergillosis. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports associating these two conditions together. Case Presentation. A 32-year-old female was admitted for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Her hospital course was complicated by pulmonary aspergillosis. On hospital day 55, she acutely developed severe global aphasia with right hemiplegia. A CT and CT-angiogram of her head and neck were obtained demonstrating intravascular air emboli within the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) branches. She was emergently taken for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Evaluation for origin of the air embolus revealed an air focus along the left lower pulmonary vein. Over the course of 48 hours, her symptoms significantly improved. Conclusion. This unique case details an immunocompromised patient with pulmonary aspergillosis cavitary lesions that invaded into a pulmonary vein and caused a cerebral air embolism. With cerebral air embolisms, the acute treatment option differs from the typical ischemic stroke pathway and the provider should consider emergent HBOT. This case highlights the importance of considering atypical causes of acute ischemic stroke.","['Lin, Chen', 'Barrio, George A', 'Hurwitz, Lynne M', 'Kranz, Peter G']","['Lin C', 'Barrio GA', 'Hurwitz LM', 'Kranz PG']","['Department of Neurology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140814,United States,Case Rep Neurol Med,Case reports in neurological medicine,101576451,,,,,,2014/09/10 06:00,2014/09/10 06:01,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/406106 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Neurol Med. 2014;2014:406106. doi: 10.1155/2014/406106.

The level of SFRP2 expression significantly decreased in AML compared to controls (P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed that an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.871 (P<0.001) or 0.902 (P<0.001) in discriminating all patients or cytogenetically normal (CN) patients from controls, respectively. Low level of SFRP2 expression was found more frequently in cytogenetically intermediate and poor groups (72% and 62%, respectively) than in favorable group (42%) (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the rate of complete remission (CR) and overall survival between the groups with low SFRP2 and high expression (P>0.05). SFRP2 expression significantly increased after CR compared to initial diagnosis (P<0.05).

Aneuploidy poses a growth disadvantage for cells grown in vitro, suggesting that cancer cells adapt to this burden. To understand better the consequences of aneuploidy in a rapidly proliferating adult tissue, we engineered a mouse in which chromosome instability was selectively induced in T cells. A flanked by Lox mutation was introduced into the monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) spindle-assembly checkpoint gene so that Cre-mediated recombination would create a truncated protein (Mps1(DK)) that retained the kinase domain but lacked the kinetochore-binding domain and thereby weakened the checkpoint. In a sensitized p53(+/-) background we observed that Mps1(DK/DK) mice suffered from rapid-onset acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. The tumors were highly aneuploid and exhibited a metabolic burden similar to that previously characterized in aneuploid yeast and cultured cells. The tumors nonetheless grew rapidly and were lethal within 3-4 mo after birth.","['Foijer, Floris', 'Xie, Stephanie Z', 'Simon, Judith E', 'Bakker, Petra L', 'Conte, Nathalie', 'Davis, Stephanie H', 'Kregel, Eva', 'Jonkers, Jos', 'Bradley, Allan', 'Sorger, Peter K']","['Foijer F', 'Xie SZ', 'Simon JE', 'Bakker PL', 'Conte N', 'Davis SH', 'Kregel E', 'Jonkers J', 'Bradley A', 'Sorger PK']","['European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, NL-9713 AV, Groningen, The Netherlands; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; Mouse Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, United Kingdom; and f.foijer@umcg.nl peter_sorger@hms.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, NL-9713 AV, Groningen, The Netherlands;', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, NL-9713 AV, Groningen, The Netherlands;', 'Mouse Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, NL-1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, NL-1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Mouse Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; f.foijer@umcg.nl peter_sorger@hms.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140902,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Ttk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CIN', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'chromosomal instability', 'mouse models', 'tumor metabolism']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1400892111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1400892111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 16;111(37):13427-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1400892111.

Cancers like multiple myeloma (MM), which display elevated activity in key translation regulatory nodes, such as the PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin and MYC-eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E pathways, are predicted to be particularly sensitive to therapeutic strategies that target this process. To identify novel vulnerabilities in MM, we undertook a focused RNAi screen in which components of the translation apparatus were targeted. Our screen was designed to identify synthetic lethal relationships between translation factors or regulators and dexamethasone (DEX), a corticosteroid used as frontline therapy in this disease. We find that suppression of all three subunits of the eIF4F cap-binding complex synergizes with DEX in MM to induce cell death. Using a suite of small molecules that target various activities of eIF4F, we observed that cell survival and DEX resistance are attenuated upon eIF4F inhibition in MM cell lines and primary human samples. Levels of MYC and myeloid cell leukemia 1, two known eIF4F-responsive transcripts and key survival factors in MM, were reduced upon eIF4F inhibition, and their independent suppression also synergized with DEX. Inhibition of eIF4F in MM exerts pleotropic effects unraveling a unique therapeutic opportunity.","['Robert, Francis', 'Roman, William', 'Bramoulle, Alexandre', 'Fellmann, Christof', 'Roulston, Anne', 'Shustik, Chaim', 'Porco, John A Jr', 'Shore, Gordon C', 'Sebag, Michael', 'Pelletier, Jerry']","['Robert F', 'Roman W', 'Bramoulle A', 'Fellmann C', 'Roulston A', 'Shustik C', 'Porco JA Jr', 'Shore GC', 'Sebag M', 'Pelletier J']","['Departments of Biochemistry.', 'Medicine and Hematology, and.', 'The Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6;', 'Mirimus, Inc., Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724; and.', 'The Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6;', 'Medicine and Hematology, and.', 'Center for Chemical Methodology and Library Development, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Departments of Biochemistry, The Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6;', 'Medicine and Hematology, and michael.sebag@mcgill.ca jerry.pelletier@mcgill.ca.', 'Departments of Biochemistry, The Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6; Oncology, and michael.sebag@mcgill.ca jerry.pelletier@mcgill.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140902,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F/*metabolism', 'Genes, Modifier', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA Interference/drug effects', 'Suppression, Genetic/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['RNAi screening', 'eIF4A', 'hippuristanol', 'silvestrol']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1402650111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1402650111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 16;111(37):13421-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1402650111.

We performed a large-scale nationwide retrospective analysis to elucidate the outcomes of allo-HSCT on AML with CNS involvement (CNS+AML). Clinical data were collected from a registry database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. CNS involvement was defined as the infiltration of leukemia cells into the CNS or myeloid sarcoma in the CNS identified at any time from diagnosis to transplantation. One hundred fifty-seven patients with CNS+AML underwent allo-HSCT between 2006 and 2011. The estimated overall survival, cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality at 2 years for CNS+AML (51.2%, 30.2%, and 14.5%, respectively) were comparable with those for AML without CNS involvement (48.6%, 27.4%, and 22.0%, respectively).

HR was defined as fludarabine-refractoriness or early relapse (<36 months) after fludarabine-based treatment; 26 patients were included as HR, 19 patients had AIC, and 15 patients had RT. In the HR cohort, overall response rate was 54%, progression-free and overall survival were 9 and 21 months. In AIC patients overall response rate was 74%, progression-free and overall-survival were 10 and 41 months, respectively, and median increase in hemoglobin was 3.4 g/L. RT patients responded in 67%, progression-free was 10 and overall survival 21 months. The most common adverse events were hematologic toxicities in 92%. Severe infections occurred in 28%. Treatment was discontinued early in 45% of all patients mainly as a result of toxicity. This trial shows that R-CHOP has no role in treating complicated CLL. R-CHOP is associated with significant toxicities and fairly low efficacy compared with almost every other CLL-regimen.

Cumulative complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates by 24 months were similar (bosutinib, 79%; imatinib, 80%); cumulative major molecular response (MMR) rates were 59% for bosutinib and 49% for imatinib. Responses were durable; 151/197 vs. 172/204 and 125/153 vs. 117/131 responders remained on treatment and maintained CCyR and MMR, respectively. Since the 12-month primary analysis, no new accelerated-/blast-phase transformations occurred with bosutinib; four occurred with imatinib. Early response (BCR-ABL1/ABL1 </= 10%, 3 months) was associated with better CCyR and MMR rates by 12 and 24 months (both arms). Gastrointestinal events and liver function test elevations were more common, and neutropenia, musculoskeletal events and oedema were less common with bosutinib. Discontinuations due to adverse events were more common with bosutinib versus imatinib (most commonly alanine aminotransferase elevation: 4% vs. <1%); most occurred within the first 12 months. Cardiovascular adverse events were similar in both arms. Bosutinib continues to demonstrate good efficacy and manageable tolerability in newly diagnosed CP-CML patients.","['Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'de Souza, Carmino Antonio', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Duvillie, Ladan', 'Pavlov, Dmitri', 'Gogat, Karin', 'Countouriotis, Athena M', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Brummendorf TH', 'Cortes JE', 'de Souza CA', 'Guilhot F', 'Duvillie L', 'Pavlov D', 'Gogat K', 'Countouriotis AM', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Universitatsklinikum Aachen, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140908,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Odds Ratio', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML', 'bosutinib', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2014/09/10 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13108 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jan;168(1):69-81. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13108.

Current standard practices for treatment of HCC are less than satisfactory because of metastasis and recurrence, which are primarily attributed to the angiogenesis. So, the anti-angiogenesis treatment has become the new approach for HCC therapy. In addition to treating leukemia, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) also suppresses other solid tumors, including HCC. However, the roles of As2O3 in the angiogenesis potential of HCC cells remain unclear. In our present study, As2O3 attenuated the angiogenic ability by the microRNA-491 (miR-491)-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta/SMAD3/NF-kappaB signal pathway in MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells. Briefly, in these cells, As2O3 improved the expression of miR-491 via DNA-demethylation; miR-491, which targeted the SMAD3-3'-UTR, decreased the expression/function of SMAD3, leading to the inactivation of NF-kappaB/IL-6/STAT-3 signaling; knockdown of miR-491 abolished the As2O3-induced inhibitions of the TGF-beta/SMAD3/NF-kappaB pathway, the VEGF secretion, and the angiogenesis. By understanding a novel mechanism whereby As2O3 inhibits the angiogenic potential in HCC cells, our study would help in the design of future strategies of developing As2O3 as a potential chemopreventive agent when used alone or in combination with other current anticancer drugs.","['Jiang, Fei', 'Wang, Xingxing', 'Liu, Qinqiang', 'Shen, Jian', 'Li, Zhong', 'Li, Yuan', 'Zhang, Jianping']","['Jiang F', 'Wang X', 'Liu Q', 'Shen J', 'Li Z', 'Li Y', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China; The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210011, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210011, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China; The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.

Previously, we discovered a potential therapeutic molecular target, MDX3 (MAX dimerization protein 3), in preB ALL. In this study, we hypothesize that an effective siRNA therapy for preB ALL can be developed using antiCD22 antibody (alphaCD22 Ab) and nanoparticles. We composed nanocomplexes with super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO NPs), alphaCD22 Abs and MXD3 siRNA molecules based on physical interactions between the molecules. We demonstrated that the MXD3 siRNA-alphaCD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes entered leukaemia cells and knocked down MXD3, leading the cells to undergo apoptosis and resulting in decreased live cell counts in the cell line Reh and in primary preB ALL samples in vitro. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of the MXD3 siRNA-alphaCD22 Ab-SPIO NP complexes were significantly enhanced by addition of the chemotherapy drugs vincristine or doxorubicin.

Lack of effective treatment strategies has resulted in an extensive quest for new therapeutic molecules against it. This study explores the molecular mechanism of anticancer activity of P16, a semisynthetic analog of parthenin, against the human acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells. P16 displayed antiproliferative activity in different cancer cell lines; however, MOLT-4 cells showed highest sensitivity for P16 with IC50 value of 0.6muM. Further studies revealed that P16 induced cell death by apoptosis. It caused mitochondrial stress, which was mediated by the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and consequent activation of caspase-9. However, P16 was also able to activate caspase-8, thus involving both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Further, activation of caspase-3 led to cleavage of its target proteins PARP-1 and ICAD, which resulted in apoptotic DNA damage. P16 induced apoptosis was accompanied by the down-regulation of important leukemic cell survival proteins like pAKT (S473), pAKT (T308), pP70S6K, pCRAF, and pERK1/2. However, inhibition of caspases by Z-VAD-FMK reversed the down-regulatory effect of P16 on pAKT (S473) and pP70S6K, as evident by the cell viability assay and flow cytometric analysis but this inhibition did not completely reverse the antiproliferative effect of P16, thereby indicating the role of additional factors apart from caspases in P16 induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. Owing to its antiproliferative potential against leukemia cells, P16 can further be explored as an effective therapeutics against leukemia.","['Goswami, Akshra', 'Shah, Bhahwal Ali', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Rizvi, Masood Ahmad', 'Kumar, Suresh', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Malik, Fayaz Ahmed', 'Batra, Navneet', 'Joshi, Amit', 'Singh, Jagtar']","['Goswami A', 'Shah BA', 'Kumar A', 'Rizvi MA', 'Kumar S', 'Bhushan S', 'Malik FA', 'Batra N', 'Joshi A', 'Singh J']","['Department of Biotechnology, Panjab University, Chandigarh 160014, India.', 'Division of Natural Products Microbes, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.', 'Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Kashmir, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India.', 'Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.', 'Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.', 'Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Goswami Ganesh Dutt Sanatan Dharam College, Sector-32, Chandigarh 160047, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector-26, Chandigarh 160019, India.

Historically, these disorders which have been lumped with either MDS or MPN have represented a minority, or been excluded all together, from the development of prognostic models and clinical trials. Therefore, Food and Drug Administration approved therapies specifically for overlap subtypes are lacking.

Additionally, these recurrent genetic lesions have a prognostic value and are potential therapeutic targets, which might ultimately improve patient outcomes by reducing disease-related symptoms and complications and by prolonging survival.","['Gerds, Aaron T']",['Gerds AT'],"['Leukemia Program, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Desk R35, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA, gerdsa@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Humans', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/09/08 06:00'],"['2014/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-014-0233-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2014 Dec;9(4):400-6. doi: 10.1007/s11899-014-0233-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients still relapse after PAs, or fail to reach an optimal response, and new agents are needed to further improve treatment outcome. We retrospectively studied 41 HCL patients from 10 centers in France and Belgium, who received 49 treatment courses with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. Most of the patients were treated at relapse (84 % of cases) and rituximab was combined to a PA in 41 % of cases. Overall, response rate is 90 % including 71 % complete hematologic responses (CHRs). Frontline treatment, combination therapy, and absolute neutrophil count were associated with response in multivariate analysis. Three-year relapse-free and overall survivals are 68 and 90 %, respectively. When combined to a PA, rituximab yields a 100 % response rate, even beyond frontline therapy. In contrast, response rate is only 82 % (59 % CHR) when rituximab is used alone. In this latter setting, relapse rate is 56 % and median time to relapse is 17.5 months. All eight patients who were treated two times with the antibody responded again to re-treatment. We confirm the high efficacy of the combination rituximab + PA. However, when rituximab is used as monotherapy, response rate is lower and the high relapse rate is a concern. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the superiority of the combination rituximab + PA over PA alone, both as frontline therapy and at relapse.","['Leclerc, Mathieu', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Noel, Marie-Pierre', 'Vekhoff, Anne', 'Troussard, Xavier', 'Claisse, Jean-Francois', 'Thieblemont, Catherine', 'Maloisel, Frederic', 'Beguin, Yves', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Barbe, Coralie', 'Delmer, Alain']","['Leclerc M', 'Suarez F', 'Noel MP', 'Vekhoff A', 'Troussard X', 'Claisse JF', 'Thieblemont C', 'Maloisel F', 'Beguin Y', 'Tamburini J', 'Barbe C', 'Delmer A']","[""Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Reims, Hopital Robert Debre, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Reims, France, matleclerc@hotmail.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140907,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/03/21 06:00,['2014/09/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2175-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Jan;94(1):89-95. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2175-0.

METHODS: Ethanol extracts were prepared from Thymus vulgaris L. and Origanum syriacum L. plants and investigated against the THP-1 leukemia cell line and freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay were respectively used to determine the cellular viability and cytotoxicity in response to treatment with increasing extract concentrations. RESULTS: Both extracts exhibited a concentration dependent reduction in viability of the THP-1 cells (IC50 = 2.126 mg/mL for O. syriacum, and 0.1569 mg/mL for T. vulgaris). O. syriacum was more potent against the PBMCs (IC50 = 0.4247 mg/mL), while T. vulgaris was moderately selective (IC50 = 0.3345 mg/mL with PBMCs and SI = 2.1). Only in O. syriacum the reduction in cells viability was caused by cytotoxic effect against leukemic cells (LC50 = of 9.646 mg/mL). CONCLUSION: T. vulgaris and O. syriacum are both antileukemic in vitro. T. vulgaris represents a potential selective cytostatic and safe target for future anticancer agents' development. O. syriacum on the other hand is cytotoxic against the leukemia cell line THP-1.","['Ayesh, Basim M', 'Abed, Abdalla A', ""Faris, Doa'a M""]","['Ayesh BM', 'Abed AA', 'Faris DM']","['European Gaza Hospital Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Gaza, Palestine. d_fariss@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140907,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethanol/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', '*Origanum/chemistry', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Components, Aerial', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Solvents/chemistry', '*Thymus Plant/chemistry']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/09/08 06:00'],"['2014/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-0500-7-612 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-7-612 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2014 Sep 7;7:612. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-7-612.,,,PMC4175567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Tunisia, emerging country, some cases of acute leukemias are still treated on the basis of an only cytologic study because of lack of cytometry. Our objective is to realize a confrontation between cytology and flow cytometry in the diagnosis of AL and to analyze discrepancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study concerns 100 cases of AL. A second double-blind examination of the bone marrow smears of acute leukemias is realized by two cytologists and confronted to immunophenotyping. RESULTS: In two cases of AML, flow cytometry reassigned lineage into T ALL and biphenotypic AL. In three cases of ALL the lineage was reassigned into undifferentiated acute leukemia (2 cases) and biphenotypic acute leukemia (1 case). Lineage was not established in four cases, immunophenotyping allowed the diagnosis of B ALL in 3 cases, and of biphenotypic acute leukemia in 1 case. In both cases of discrepant findings, flow cytometry allowed the diagnosis of biphenotypic acute leukemia in a case and of AML in the other one. CONCLUSION: The cytological study remains insufficient in the diagnosis of lineage even with experimented cytologists. Immunophenotyping is essential in lineage assignment and reassignment.","['Ben Salah, N', 'El Borgi, W', 'Chelbi, A', 'Ben Lakhal, F', 'Gouider, E', 'Aounallah Skhiri, H', 'Hafsia, R']","['Ben Salah N', 'El Borgi W', 'Chelbi A', 'Ben Lakhal F', 'Gouider E', 'Aounallah Skhiri H', 'Hafsia R']","[""Departement d'hematologie, faculte de medecine de Tunis, universite Tunis El Manar, rue Jebel Lakhdar, Tunis, Tunisie.

Here we identify a new long range-acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.","['Herranz, Daniel', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Palomero, Teresa', 'Schnell, Stephanie A', 'Belver, Laura', 'Wendorff, Agnieszka A', 'Xu, Luyao', 'Castillo-Martin, Mireia', 'Llobet-Navas, David', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Herranz D', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Palomero T', 'Schnell SA', 'Belver L', 'Wendorff AA', 'Xu L', 'Castillo-Martin M', 'Llobet-Navas D', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Clappier E', 'Soulier J', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', '1] Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

Most previous studies have been focused on dasatinib, and the few cases of nilotinib withdrawal that have been reported had a median follow-up of 12 months. To the best of our knowledge, the present report is the first to describe nilotinib withdrawal with 30 months of follow-up. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 64-year-old Caucasian man diagnosed with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in April 2005. After 4 years of treatment with imatinib, he became intolerant to the drug and was switched to nilotinib. Two years later, he decided to stop nilotinib. Undetectable molecular response persisted for 30 months after discontinuation of the drug. CONCLUSION: Our present case suggests that nilotinib withdrawal is safe for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who achieve a stable undetectable molecular response. Our patient was homozygous for killer immunoglobulin-like receptor haplotype A, previously reported to be a promising immunogenetic marker for undetectable molecular response. We recommend additional studies to investigate patient immunogenetic profiles and their potential role in complete response to therapy.","['Caocci, Giovanni', 'Greco, Marianna', 'La Nasa, Giorgio']","['Caocci G', 'Greco M', 'La Nasa G']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Center, ""R Binaghi"" Hospital, Via Is Guadazzonis 3, 09126 Cagliari, Italy. giovanni.caocci@unica.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140906,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Withholding Treatment']",,,2014/09/10 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/09/08 06:00'],"['2014/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-8-295 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-8-295 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2014 Sep 6;8:295. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-8-295.,,,PMC4160914,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autophagy has a pivotal role in host immunity and is regulated by various cytokines. Here, we report that IL-27 inhibits IFN-gamma and starvation induced autophagy and as a result blocks phagosome maturation and promotes intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Addition of exogenous IL-27 induces the activation of mTOR through JAK/PI3 K pathway and inhibits IFN-gamma stimulated autophagy. Furthermore, blockade of JAKs obstructs the inhibitory effect of IL-27 on IFN-gamma induced autophagy. Besides this, IL-27 also up-regulates Mcl-1 through PI3 K pathway. We further show that in mTOR or Mcl-1 silenced THP-1 cells, IL-27 could no longer inhibit IFN-gamma mediated autophagy in M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected cells. Altogether, our study demonstrates that IL-27 by concurrent activation of JAK/PI3 K/Akt/mTOR cascade as well as up-regulation of Mcl-1 inhibits IFN-gamma induced autophagy and elimination of intracellular mycobacteria in macrophages.","['Sharma, Gaurav', 'Dutta, Rajesh Kumar', 'Khan, Mohammad Aslam', 'Ishaq, Mohammad', 'Sharma, Kapil', 'Malhotra, Himanshu', 'Majumdar, Sekhar']","['Sharma G', 'Dutta RK', 'Khan MA', 'Ishaq M', 'Sharma K', 'Malhotra H', 'Majumdar S']","['Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.', 'Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.', 'Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.', 'Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.', 'Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.', 'Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.', 'Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR), Chandigarh 160036, India.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: An infant with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia with extensive cutaneous involvement was given total skin irradiation using inverse-planned helical tomotherapy. Quality assurance tests to determine the deliverability of the technique and the accuracy of dose estimation at the superficial skin level were devised and performed. Daily megavoltage imaging, tomotherapy plan adaptive evaluation, in vivo skin dose measurements, and cumulative dose summation were tools employed to assess the quality of treatment and positioning reproducibility on a daily basis. RESULTS: The quality assurance checks showed that tomotherapy can indeed be used for total skin irradiation in cases where conventional electron treatment delivery is not possible. However, the overestimation of absorbed dose near surface by the treatment planning software must be quantified and taken into account using in-phantom and in vivo dosimetry techniques with appropriate detectors. Daily imaging allows for superior positioning, while daily plan adaptive and dose summations based on the plan adaptive calculations allow for evaluation of the treatment delivery. CONCLUSIONS: An infant has been treated successfully using helical TomoTherapy for total skin irradiation prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant. The course of treatment was uncomplicated and the patient is doing well more than 15 months following therapy.","['Sarfehnia, Arman', 'Poon, Emily', 'Davis, Stephen D', 'Fleming, Adam', 'Mitchell, David', 'Freeman, Carolyn R']","['Sarfehnia A', 'Poon E', 'Davis SD', 'Fleming A', 'Mitchell D', 'Freeman CR']","['Department of Medical Physics, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes among 341 newly diagnosed PTCL patients from 2000 to 2011. Outcome was compared with a matched cohort of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, and prognostic factors were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: PTCL subtypes included PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) (31%), anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL) (26%), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (23%), NK/T-cell lymphoma (7%), acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (6%), and other (7%). Median age was 62 years (range 18-95 years), and 74% had stage III-IV disease. Twenty-three (7%) patients received only palliative care whereas 318 received chemotherapy: CHOP-like regimens (70%), hyperCVAD/MA (6%), or other (18%). Thirty-three patients (10%) underwent stem-cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission. The overall response rate was 73% (61% complete); 24% had primary refractory disease. With 39-month median follow-up, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 32% and 52%. PFS and OS for PTCL patients were significantly inferior to matched patients with DLBCL. On multivariate analysis, stage I-II disease was the only significant pretreatment prognostic factor [PFS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.85, P = 0.007; OS: HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.78, P = 0.006]. ALK positivity in ALCL was prognostic on univariate analysis, but lost significance on multivariate analysis. The most dominant prognostic factor was response to initial therapy (complete response versus other), including adjustment for stage and SCT [PFS: HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.14-0.28, P < 0.0001; OS: HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17-0.40, P < 0.0001]. No overall survival difference was observed based on choice of upfront regimen or SCT in first remission. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis identifies early-stage disease and initial treatment response as dominant prognostic factors in PTCL. No clear benefit was observed for patients undergoing consolidative SCT. Novel therapeutic approaches for PTCL are critically needed.","['Abramson, J S', 'Feldman, T', 'Kroll-Desrosiers, A R', 'Muffly, L S', 'Winer, E', 'Flowers, C R', 'Lansigan, F', 'Nabhan, C', 'Nastoupil, L J', 'Nath, R', 'Goy, A', 'Castillo, J J', 'Jagadeesh, D', 'Woda, B', 'Rosen, S T', 'Smith, S M', 'Evens, A M']","['Abramson JS', 'Feldman T', 'Kroll-Desrosiers AR', 'Muffly LS', 'Winer E', 'Flowers CR', 'Lansigan F', 'Nabhan C', 'Nastoupil LJ', 'Nath R', 'Goy A', 'Castillo JJ', 'Jagadeesh D', 'Woda B', 'Rosen ST', 'Smith SM', 'Evens AM']","['Center for Lymphoma, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Miriam Hospital, Providence.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.', 'Robert H.

PATIENTS: Between 1995 and 2007, 2233 patients with FL had their first ASCT with either a total body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen or carmustin, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM), of which 47% were autografted in first remission. RESULTS: After a median observation time of 73 months (interquartile range 30-107), 5- and 10-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was similar (6% and 10% in both groups). No significant NRM differences became evident after multivariate adjustment for confounders. Secondary malignancies were observed in 9.7% and 7.9% of the patients after TBI and BEAM (P = 0.19), which were treatment-related myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myelogenous leukaemia (t-MDS/AML) in 3.4% and 2.8% (P = 0.57). The median time to t-MDS/AML was around 50 months in both groups. Because of a lower relapse incidence, TBI was associated with better event-free survival reaching statistical significance in the patients transplanted in first remission but not in those transplanted beyond first remission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with FL who received TBI-based ASCT after 1995 increased NRM and t-MDS/AML risks did not emerge compared with BEAM while disease control was at least equivalent.","['El-Najjar, I', 'Boumendil, A', 'Luan, J J', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Thomson, K', 'Mohty, M', 'Colombat, P', 'Biron, P', 'Tilly, H', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Sureda, A', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Vernant, J P', 'Gribben, J', 'Cook, G', 'Haynes, A P', 'Ferrant, A', 'Finel, H', 'Montoto, S', 'Dreger, P']","['El-Najjar I', 'Boumendil A', 'Luan JJ', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Thomson K', 'Mohty M', 'Colombat P', 'Biron P', 'Tilly H', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Cordonnier C', 'Sureda A', 'Cahn JY', 'Vernant JP', 'Gribben J', 'Cook G', 'Haynes AP', 'Ferrant A', 'Finel H', 'Montoto S', 'Dreger P']","['Barts, London, UK.', 'EBMT LWP Office, Paris.', 'EBMT LWP Office, Paris.', 'Institute Paoli Calmettes, University de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals, London, UK.', 'INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris; Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Hospital Saint-Antoine, APHP, Paris; University Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy, CHU Bretonneau, Tours.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Lyon.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel, University of Rouen, Rouen.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Henri Mondor University Hospital, Creteil, France.', ""Department of Hematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK."", 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Grenoble.', 'APHP-Pitie Salpetriere, UPMC Universite Paris 6, Paris, France.', 'Barts, London, UK.', ""St James's Institute of Oncology, St James's University Hospital, Leeds."", 'Nottingham University Hospital, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Saint-Luc, Catholic University Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'EBMT LWP Office, Paris.', 'Barts, London, UK; EBMT LWP Office, Paris.', 'EBMT LWP Office, Paris; Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

Although these disorders are characterized by the expansion of different cell types (T and natural killer) with specific genetic features and abnormalities, several lines of evidence suggest a common pathogenetic mechanism. According to this interpretation, we speculated that in patients with natural killer-type chronic lymphoproliferative disorder, together with natural killer cells, also T lymphocytes undergo a persistent antigenic pressure, possibly resulting in an ultimate clonal T-cell selection. To strengthen this hypothesis, we evaluated whether clonal T-cell populations were detectable in 48 patients with killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-restricted natural killer-type chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. At diagnosis, in half of the patients studied, we found a clearly defined clonal T-cell population, despite the fact that all cases presented with a well-characterized natural killer disorder. Follow-up analysis confirmed that the TCR gamma rearrangements were stable over the time period evaluated; furthermore, in 7 patients we demonstrated the appearance of a clonal T subset that progressively matures, leading to a switch between killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-restricted natural killer-type disorder to a monoclonal T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.

Analysis of clinical implications of bone marrow CXCR4 expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia showed not only higher CXCR4 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor, irrespective of age, white blood cell counts, cytogenetics, and mutation status of NPM1/FLT3-ITD and CEBPA, but also showed CXCR4 expression was inversely associated with mutations of CEBPA, a gene encoding transcription factor C/EBPalpha. Patients with wild-type CEBPA had significantly higher CXCR4 expression than those with mutated CEBPA. We hypothesized that CEBPA might influence the expression of CXCR4. To test this hypothesis, we first examined endogenous CXCR4 expression in 293T and K562 cells over-expressing wild-type C/EBPalpha p42 and demonstrated that CXCR4 levels were increased in these cells, whilst the expression of the N-terminal mutant, C/EBPalpha p30, diminished CXCR4 transcription. We further showed p42 was bound to the CXCR4 promoter by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Induction of p42 in the inducible K562-C/EBPalpha cell lines increased the chemotactic migration. Moreover, decreased expression of C/EBPalpha by RNA interference decreased levels of CXCR4 protein expression in U937 cells, thereby abrogating CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. Our results provide, for the first time, evidence that C/EBPalpha indeed regulates the activation of CXCR4, which is critical for the homing and engraftment of acute myeloid leukemia cells, while p30 mutant impairs CXCR4 expression.","['Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chen, Yin-Kai', 'Li, Li-Yu', 'Chen, Po-Hsuen', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Kuo YY', 'Hou HA', 'Chen YK', 'Li LY', 'Chen PH', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Chou WC', 'Liu CY', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Tien HF']","['Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei; yykuo@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei; Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei;', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei; Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Biostatistics Consulting Laboratory, Department of Nursing, National Taipei College of Nursing, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei;']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140905,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/07 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/09/07 06:00'],"['2014/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.107821 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.107821 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Dec;99(12):1799-807. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.107821.

Functional ALOX5 was assessed using an LTB4 ELISA and ALOX5, and LTB4R1 mRNA expression was determined via a TaqMan gene expression assay. LTB4R1 and 5-LOX protein levels were assessed by cell surface flow cytometry analysis. At diagnosis ALOX5 was below normal in both blood and CD34(+) stem cells in all patients. On treatment initiation, ALOX5 levels increased in all patients except those who were destined to progress subsequently to blast crisis. LTB4 levels were increased despite low ALOX5 expression, suggesting that the arachidonic acid pathway is functioning normally up to the point of LTB4 production. However, the LTB4 receptor (BLT1) protein in newly diagnosed patients was significantly lower than after a period of treatment (P<0.0001). The low level of LTB4R1 at diagnosis explains the downregulation of ALOX5. In the absence of LTB4R1, the arachidonic acid pathway intermediates (5-HEPTE and LTA4) negatively regulate ALOX5. ALOX5 regulation is aberrant in chronic myeloid leukemia patients and may not be important for the development of the disease.

The clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid (CALM) protein plays an essential role in the cellular import of iron by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CALM-AF10 leukemias harbor a single copy of the normal CALM gene and therefore may be more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of iron restriction compared with normal hematopoietic cells. We found that CALM heterozygous (CALM(HET)) murine fibroblasts exhibit signs of iron deficiency, with increased surface transferrin receptor levels and reduced growth rates. CALM(HET) hematopoietic cells are more sensitive in vitro to iron chelators than their wild type counterparts. Iron chelation also displayed toxicity toward cultured CALM(HET)CALM-AF10 leukemia cells, and this effect was additive to that of chemotherapy. In mice transplanted with CALM(HET)CALM-AF10 leukemia, we found that dietary iron restriction reduced tumor burden in the spleen. However, dietary iron restriction, used alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy, did not increase survival of mice with CALM(HET)CALM-AF10 leukemia. In summary, although CALM heterozygosity results in iron deficiency and increased sensitivity to iron chelation in vitro, our data in mice do not suggest that iron depletion strategies would be beneficial for the therapy of CALM-AF10 leukemia patients.","['Heath, Jessica L', 'Weiss, Joshua M', 'Lavau, Catherine P', 'Wechsler, Daniel S']","['Heath JL', 'Weiss JM', 'Lavau CP', 'Wechsler DS']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140903,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Iron, Dietary)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, mouse)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chelation Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deferasirox', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Iron, Dietary/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Triazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Burden']",,,2014/09/07 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2014/09/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2014.08.004 [doi]', 'S0301-472X(14)00664-X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2014 Dec;42(12):1022-1030.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2014.08.004.

We tested the transforming properties of JAK3 pseudokinase and kinase domain mutants using in vitro and in vivo assays. Most, but not all, JAK3 mutants transformed cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 or MOHITO cell lines to cytokine-independent proliferation. JAK3 pseudokinase mutants were dependent on Jak1 kinase activity for cellular transformation, whereas the JAK3 kinase domain mutant could transform cells in a Jak1 kinase-independent manner. Reconstitution of the IL7 receptor signaling complex in 293T cells showed that JAK3 mutants required receptor binding to mediate downstream STAT5 phosphorylation. Mice transplanted with bone marrow progenitor cells expressing JAK3 mutants developed a long-latency transplantable T-ALL-like disease, characterized by an accumulation of immature CD8(+) T cells. In vivo treatment of leukemic mice with the JAK3 selective inhibitor tofacitinib reduced the white blood cell count and caused leukemic cell apoptosis. Our data show that JAK3 mutations are drivers of T-ALL and require the cytokine receptor complex for transformation.

JAK2 inhibitor therapy in MF patients results in a rapid reduction of the degree of splenomegaly, yet the mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. The in vitro treatment of splenic and peripheral blood MF CD34(+) cells with the JAK1/2/3 inhibitor, AZD1480, reduced the absolute number of CD34(+), CD34(+)CD90(+), and CD34(+)CXCR4(+) cells as well as assayable hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) irrespective of the JAK2 and calreticulin mutational status. Furthermore, AZD1480 treatment resulted in only a modest reduction in the proportion of HPCs that were JAK2V617F(+) or had a chromosomal abnormality. To study the effect of the drug on MF stem cells (MF-SCs), splenic CD34(+) cells were treated with AZD1480 and transplanted into immunodeficient mice. JAK2 inhibitor therapy did not affect the degree of human cell chimerism or the proportion of malignant donor cells. These data indicate that JAK2 inhibitor treatment affects a subpopulation of MF-HPCs, while sparing another HPC subpopulation as well as MF-SCs. This pattern of activity might account for the reduction in spleen size observed with JAK2 inhibitor therapy as well as the rapid increase in spleen size observed frequently with its discontinuation.","['Wang, Xiaoli', 'Ye, Fei', 'Tripodi, Joseph', 'Hu, Cing Siang', 'Qiu, Jiajing', 'Najfeld, Vesna', 'Novak, Jesse', 'Li, Yan', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Hoffman, Ronald']","['Wang X', 'Ye F', 'Tripodi J', 'Hu CS', 'Qiu J', 'Najfeld V', 'Novak J', 'Li Y', 'Rampal R', 'Hoffman R']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Pathology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140905,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AZD 1480)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spleen/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Thrombocytosis/drug therapy/genetics/pathology']",,,2014/09/07 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/09/07 06:00'],"['2014/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35413-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-02-558015 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 6;124(19):2987-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-02-558015.

T315I mutation in the Bcr-Abl is the predominant mechanism of the acquired resistance to IM and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Therefore it is urgent to search for new measures to overcome TKI-resistance. Auranofin (AF), clinically used to treat rheumatic arthritis, was recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration for Phase II clinical trial to treat cancer. In contrast to the reports that AF induces apoptosis by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels via inhibiting thioredoxin reductase, our recent study revealed that AF-induced apoptosis depends on inhibition of proteasomal deubiquitinases (UCHL5 and USP14). Here we report that (i) AF induces apoptosis in both Bcr-Abl wild-type cells and Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation cells and inhibits the growth of IM-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I xenografts in vivo; (ii) AF inhibits Bcr-Abl through both downregulation of Bcr-Abl gene expression and Bcr-Abl cleavage mediated by proteasome inhibition-induced caspase activation; (iii) proteasome inhibition but not ROS is required for AF-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. These findings support that AF overcomes IM resistance through both Bcr/Abl-dependent and -independent mechanisms, providing great clinical significance for cancer treatment.","['Chen, Xin', 'Shi, Xianping', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Li, Xiaofen', 'Lan, Xiaoying', 'Liu, Shouting', 'Huang, Hongbiao', 'Liu, Ningning', 'Liao, Siyan', 'Zang, Dan', 'Song, Wenbin', 'Liu, Quentin', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Dou, Q Ping', 'Wang, Xuejun', 'Liu, Jinbao']","['Chen X', 'Shi X', 'Zhao C', 'Li X', 'Lan X', 'Liu S', 'Huang H', 'Liu N', 'Liao S', 'Zang D', 'Song W', 'Liu Q', 'Carter BZ', 'Dou QP', 'Wang X', 'Liu J']","['State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, Departments of Pathophysiology and Biochemistry, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong 510182, China;

PL selectively kills both solid and hematologic cancer cells, but not normal counterparts. Here we evaluated the effect of PL on the proliferation and survival of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), including glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant B-ALL. Regardless of GC-resistance, PL inhibited the proliferation of all B-ALL cell lines, but not normal B cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced apoptosis via elevation of ROS. Interestingly, PL did not sensitize most of B-ALL cell lines to dexamethasone (DEX). Only UoC-B1 exhibited a weak synergistic effect between PL and DEX. All B-ALL cell lines tested exhibited constitutive activation of multiple transcription factors (TFs), including AP-1, MYC, NF-kappaB, SP1, STAT1, STAT3, STAT6 and YY1. Treatment of the B-ALL cells with PL significantly downregulated these TFs and modulated their target genes. While activation of AURKB, BIRC5, E2F1, and MYB mRNA levels were significantly downregulated by PL, but SOX4 and XBP levels were increased by PL. Intriguingly, PL also increased the expression of p21 in B-ALL cells through a p53-independent mechanism. Given that these TFs and their target genes play critical roles in a variety of hematological malignancies, our findings provide a strong preclinical rationale for considering PL as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including B-ALL and GC-resistant B-ALL.","['Han, Seong-Su', 'Han, Sangwoo', 'Kamberos, Natalie L']","['Han SS', 'Han S', 'Kamberos NL']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA.

Hypermethylation of the CpG island in DAPK inactivates the gene in a variety of human malignancies. This study aimed to detect the inactivation of DAPK in canine lymphoid tumor cells. The sequence of canine DAPK cDNA was obtained from normal dog peripheral blood mononuclear cells after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). By rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends, the transcription initiation site of the DAPK gene was identified. The CpG island located upstream of the translation initiation site was identified by using a search algorithm. The methylation status of the CpG island was examined using bisulfite sequence analysis and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The inactivation of DAPK gene was examined in 3 canine lymphoid tumor cell lines, GL-1 (B-cell leukemia), CLBL-1 (B-cell lymphoma), and CL-1 (T-cell lymphoma). DAPK mRNA expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR. IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. The influence of demethylation was examined with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). The methylation status in 14 dogs with various lymphoid tumors was screened by MSP. A 1926-bp CpG island containing 280 CpG repeats was identified upstream of the translation start site of canine DAPK. Bisulfate sequence analysis and MSP revealed hypermethylation of the CpG island in GL-1 cells, but not in CLBL-1 or CL-1 cells. The amount of DAPK mRNA was significantly smaller in GL-1 cells than CLBL-1 and CL-1 cells. IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis was detected in CLBL-1 and CL-1 cells but not in GL-1 cells. Treatment with 5-aza-dC significantly increased the amount of DAPK mRNA and IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis in GL-1 cells. These results revealed the inactivation of DAPK through methylation of its CpG island in GL-1 cells. MSP showed hypermethylation of the DAPK CpG island in 5 of 8 primary B-cell lymphoma samples, but not in any of the 6 primary T-cell lymphoid tumor samples obtained from canine patients.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most reliable method to identify dic(9;20) when compared with conventional cytogenetics. To define the prognostic importance of dic(9;20), we evaluated treatment response and patient survival. This was a retrospective study in three French university centres. Patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics and treatment response are described. Nine children with dic(9;20) have been identified since 1995. All patients had at least one poor prognostic feature either among the clinical features, the initial laboratory results or in the initial treatment response: central nervous system involvement (2/9), high median leucocyte count (>/=50 G/L) (8/9) and poor response to prednisone (2/9). All patients were in complete cytological remission after induction therapy but only three had a good molecular response with minimal residual disease (MRD) <10(-3). Five out of nine patients relapsed and two died, 4 and 12 months after diagnosis, respectively. The event-free survival rate in this population was 44 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.09-0.79) and overall survival 78 % (95 % CI = 0.51-1.05). In this population, dic(9;20) is associated with a relatively poor prognosis. Patients showing dic(9;20), whether this cytogenetic abnormality is associated with other poor prognostic factors or not, should be identified at the outset in order to be offered a more intensive treatment protocol.","['Letouzey, Mathilde', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Roche-Lestienne, Catherine', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Devoldere, Catherine', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre', 'Schneider, Pascale']","['Letouzey M', 'Penther D', 'Roche-Lestienne C', 'Nelken B', 'Devoldere C', 'Vannier JP', 'Schneider P']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit, Rouen University Hospital, 1 rue de Germont 76035, Rouen, Cedex, France, mathilde.letouzey@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140906,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/09/07 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/09/07 06:00'],"['2014/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2204-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Feb;94(2):187-93. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2204-z.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report presents the use of single-agent ofatumumab in 30 patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the French ATU program. RESULTS: These very-high-risk patients had received multiple previous treatments (median = 6), and most had disease that was fludarabine-refractory or alemtuzumab-refractory (or both) or was unsuitable for alemtuzumab treatment. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 47% (4 of 30, complete response; 10 of 30, partial response). Of 13 patients with 17p deletion, 6 displayed response to ofatumumab, including 2 complete responses. Treatment was well tolerated, with 17 grade 3 or 4 adverse events; 4 cases of grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions were reported, with favorable immediate outcome. Among nonhematologic complications, infections were the most frequent. CONCLUSION: The results confirm the efficacy and acceptable tolerability profile of ofatumumab as a single agent in severely ill patients with CLL. Attention should be paid to possible early infusion reactions to ofatumumab, as well as to the risk of infection.","['Dupuis, J', 'Brice, P', 'Francois, S', 'Ysebaert, L', 'de Guibert, S', 'Levy, V', 'Lepretre, S', 'Choquet, S', 'Dilhuydy, M S', 'Fornecker, L', 'Morel, V', 'Tempescul, A']","['Dupuis J', 'Brice P', 'Francois S', 'Ysebaert L', 'de Guibert S', 'Levy V', 'Lepretre S', 'Choquet S', 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Fornecker L', 'Morel V', 'Tempescul A']","['Unite Fonctionnelle Hemopathies Lymphoides, CHU Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.

However, their overall activity has been steadily declining over the past 35-50 million years, so that <0.05 % of TEs are presumably still ""alive"" (potentially transposable) in human populations. All the active elements are retrotransposons, either autonomous (LINE-1 and possibly the endogenous retrovirus ERVK), or non-autonomous (Alu and SVA, whose transposition is dependent on the LINE-1 enzymatic machinery). Here we show that a lineage of the endogenous retrovirus ERVE was recently engaged in ectopic recombination events and may have at least one potentially fully functional representative, initially reported as a novel retrovirus isolated from blood cells of a Chinese patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, which bears signals of positive selection on its envelope region. Altogether, there is strong evidence that ERVE should be included in the short list of potentially active TEs, and we give clues on how to identify human specific insertions of this element that are likely to be segregating in some of our populations.","['Naveira, Horacio', 'Bello, Xabier', 'Abal-Fabeiro, Jose Luis', 'Maside, Xulio']","['Naveira H', 'Bello X', 'Abal-Fabeiro JL', 'Maside X']","['Grupo de Investigacion en Bioloxia Evolutiva, Departamento de Bioloxia Celular e Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Cientificas Avanzadas (CICA), Universidade da Coruna, 15071, A Coruna, Spain, horacio.naveira.fachal@udc.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140906,Netherlands,Genetica,Genetica,0370740,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroelements)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/classification/*genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,,2014/09/07 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/09/07 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10709-014-9789-y [doi]'],ppublish,Genetica. 2014 Oct;142(5):451-60. doi: 10.1007/s10709-014-9789-y.

Although recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled genome-wide detection of various types of genomic mutations, including single nucleotide variants, indels and structural variations, only a few studies have focused on ITDs. We have developed an analytical tool called 'Genomon ITDetector' for genome-wide detection of somatic ITDs. After evaluating the sensitivity and precision of the proposed approach using synthetic data, we have demonstrated that it can successfully detect not only common ITDs involving FLT3, but also a number of ITDs affecting other putative driver genes in acute myeloid leukemia exome sequencing data.

LAP and LIP are active and inactive isoforms of C/EBPbeta, respectively. Inactive LIP dimerized with LAP to eliminate its activity. Following treatment with ATRA, CHOP expression was increased and dimerized with LIP more preferentially than LAP to rescue function of LAP. Oroxylin A has been reported to activate CHOP, a key mediator of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, and resulted in apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that low concentration of oroxylin A (<== 40 muM) showed no apoptosis effect on NB4 and HL-60 cells and decreased the CHOP protein level via promoting its degradation. MG132 was utilized to conform the effect of oroxylin A on degrading CHOP. Our results showed that oroxylin A decreased the level of IL-6 secretion of NB4 cells with or without ATRA treatment while the effect was eliminated by C/EBPbeta siRNA. We conclude that oroxylin A possessed abilities of inhibiting the ATRA-induced IL-6 production via modulation of LAP/LIP/CHOP in leukemia cell lines, which could providing a therapeutic strategy for RAS.","['Hui, Hui', 'Yang, Hao', 'Dai, Qinsheng', 'Wang, Qian', 'Yao, Jing', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Lu, Na']","['Hui H', 'Yang H', 'Dai Q', 'Wang Q', 'Yao J', 'Zhao K', 'Guo Q', 'Lu N']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.

Aberrant activity of TKs has been implicated in several types of cancers. In recent years, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to interfere with the activity of deregulated kinases. These TKIs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human cancers including head and neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and several types of leukemia. However, these TKIs are transported out of the cell by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, resulting in development of a characteristic drug resistance phenotype in cancer patients. Interestingly, some of these TKIs also inhibit the ABC transporter mediated multi drug resistance (MDR) thereby; enhancing the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. This review discusses the clinically relevant TKIs and their interaction with ABC drug transporters in modulating MDR.","['Anreddy, Nagaraju', 'Gupta, Pranav', 'Kathawala, Rishil J', 'Patel, Atish', 'Wurpel, John N D', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng']","['Anreddy N', 'Gupta P', 'Kathawala RJ', 'Patel A', 'Wurpel JN', 'Chen ZS']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA. nagaraju.anreddy08@my.stjohns.edu."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA. pranav.gupta13@my.stjohns.edu."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA. rishil.kathawala10@my.stjohns.edu."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA. atishpatel268@gmail.com."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA.
