Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proved as a useful method for analyzing many genes simultaneously. In this context, we analyzed diagnostic samples from 121 patients affected by MN and ten relapse samples from a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients using two enrichment-capture NGS gene panels. Pathogenicity classification of variants was enhanced by the development and application of a custom onco-hematology score. A total of 278 pathogenic variants were detected in 84% of patients. For structural alterations, 82% of those identified by cytogenetics were detected by NGS, 25 of 31 copy number variants and three out of three translocations. The detection of variants using NGS changed the diagnosis of seven patients and the prognosis of 15 patients and enabled us to identify 44 suitable candidates for clinical trials. Regarding AML, six of the ten relapsed patients lost or gained variants, comparing with diagnostic samples. In conclusion, the use of NGS panels in MN improves genetic characterization of the disease compared with conventional methods, thus demonstrating its potential clinical utility in routine clinical testing. This approach leads to better-adjusted treatments for each patient.","['Carbonell, Diego', 'Suarez-Gonzalez, Julia', 'Chicano, Maria', 'Andres-Zayas, Cristina', 'Trivino, Juan Carlos',

However, SMO-specific antagonists produced mixed results in clinical trials, marked by limited efficacy and high rate of acquired resistance in tumors. Here we discovered that Nilotinib, an approved inhibitor of several kinases, possesses an anti-Hh activity, at clinically achievable concentrations, due to direct binding to SMO and inhibition of SMO signaling. Nilotinib was more efficacious than the SMO-specific antagonist Vismodegib in inhibiting growth of two Hh-dependent MB cell lines. It also reduced tumor growth in subcutaneous MB mouse xenograft model. These results indicate that in addition to its known activity against several tyrosine-kinase-mediated proliferative pathways, Nilotinib is a direct inhibitor of the Hh pathway. The newly discovered extension of Nilotinib's target profile holds promise for the treatment of Hh-dependent cancers.","['Chahal, Kirti Kandhwal', 'Li, Jie', 'Kufareva, Irina', 'Parle, Milind', 'Durden, Donald L', 'Wechsler-Reya, Robert J', 'Chen, Clark C', 'Abagyan, Ruben']","['Chahal KK', 'Li J', 'Kufareva I', 'Parle M', 'Durden DL', 'Wechsler-Reya RJ', 'Chen CC', 'Abagyan R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9309-2976'],"['Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, G.J.

LncRNA LINC00641 (LINC00641), a newly discovered tumor-related lncRNA, has been reported to act as a modulator in several tumors. Hence, our study aimed to examine the expression and function of LINC00641 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression pattern of LINC00641 in AML specimens and cell lines was explored using a gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) tool and RT-PCR assays. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, transwell migration, and invasion assays were used for the functional study of cell viability, cell migration, and invasion. The influence of LINC00641 on cell cycle and apoptosis was determined using Flow cytometry detection. The regulating associations between LINC00641, miR-378a, and ZBTB20 were investigated in AML cells using the Luciferase reporter assays and RT-PCR assays RESULTS: We found that LINC00641 was highly expressed in AML specimens and cell lines. Functionally, the silence of LINC00641 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle arrest in AML cells while inducing their apoptosis. The results using bioinformatics assays predicted the complementary binding sites within LINC00641 and miR-378a, which was demonstrated by the use of the Luciferase reporter assays. In addition, we also demonstrated that ZBTB20 was a direct target of miR-378a. Moreover, the inhibition of miR-378a could rescue the ZBTB20 protein level decrease induced by LINC00641 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: We firstly identified LINC00641 as a novel AML-related lncRNA whose knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted apoptosis by modulating miR-378a/ZBTB20 axis in AML.","['Wang, J', 'Liu, Z-H', 'Yu, L-J']","['Wang J', 'Liu ZH', 'Yu LJ']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, China. xuque88416@sina.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,,,,2019/09/21 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201909_18864 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Sep;23(17):7498-7509. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201909_18864.,20201005,7498-7509,,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN378 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB20 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, this is not the trend in West Africa, including Nigeria. This study was aimed at detecting NRAS G12D and NRAS G13C mutant genes among apparently healthy and haematologic malignant individuals, and to explore their association with some clinical and demographic factors as well as disease status and progression. A total of 200 cfDNAs, 100 each from haematologic malignant patients and blood donors, respectively, were analyzed for the presence of NRAS gene mutations in codons 12 and 13. These mutations were tested using multiplex allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). The mutations were detected by selective amplification using mutation-specific synthetic oligonucleotides. NRAS G12D and NRAS G13C mutations were 20.0% and 10.0%, respectively. In 17.5% of the 100 haemapoietic cancer patients, NRAS G12D mutant genes were seen while 7.5% of NRAS G13C mutation was found. Both mutant genes were observed in five healthy blood donors each. This result confirms the existence of NRAS mutations in Nigerian haemapoietic cancer patients and the preponderance of G-A transitions over G-T transversions. Mutant NRAS genes were associated with the types and stages of cancer, highlighting probable connection between mutation and increased susceptibility as well as quick progression of hematologic malignancies in the population studied. The result also highlighted higher risk of susceptibility/progression associated with leukemia than other hematopoietic cancers. We recommend more studies on NRAS mutation specifically targeted at improved diagnosis and prognostic therapy. The role of RAS mutation should be explored in other aside blood cancers in the Nigerian population.","['Anyanwu, N C J', 'Ella, E E', 'Aminu, M', 'Kazeem, H M']","['Anyanwu NCJ', 'Ella EE', 'Aminu M', 'Kazeem HM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1280-7605', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4168-5694']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.', 'Department of Biosciences, COMSATS University, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190920,England,J Immunoassay Immunochem,Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,100963688,,['NOTNLM'],"['NRAS', 'NRAS G12D', 'NRAS G13C', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma', 'mutation']",2019/09/21 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15321819.2019.1668407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunoassay Immunochem. 2019;40(6):605-616. doi: 10.1080/15321819.2019.1668407.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-146a on childhood AL and its underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from 39 AL children and 10 non-cancer controls. The expressions of miR-146a and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in ALL and AML pediatric patients, as well as ALL (Jurkat) and AML (HL-60) cells. Correlations between miR-146a and clinical indicators were explored. A targeting relationship between miR-146a and CNTFR was detected by dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of Jurkat and HL-60 cells were measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assay, respectively. LIF expression was detected by qRT-PCR in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. The expression of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 in HL-60 cells was measured by Western blot. RESULTS: miR-146a was increased in ALL and AML pediatric patients, while CNTFR was decreased. miR-146a expression was associated with immunophenotype, karyotype, fusion gene, and SIL-TAL1. CNTFR was a target gene of miR-146a. miR-146a could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as inhibit cell apoptosis in Jurkat and HL-60 cells by downregulating CNTFR. Meanwhile, miR-146a inhibited the expression of LIF and activated JAK2/STAT3 pathway by downregulating CNTFR. CONCLUSION: miR-146a could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibit the apoptosis of AL Jurkat and HL-60 cells by downregulating CNTFR and activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.","['Wang, Lei', 'Zhang, Hongyan', 'Lei, Donghong']","['Wang L', 'Zhang H', 'Lei D']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2146-4483', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8998-308X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3060-3737']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jinan Second Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Jinan First People's Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics II, Yulin First Hospital, Suide, Shaanxi, China. leidonghong21@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,PMC6753346,['NOTNLM'],"['CNTFR', 'JAK/STAT pathway', 'acute leukemia', 'miR-146a']",2019/09/21 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2019/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['60.924 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2019.60.10.924 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2019 Oct;60(10):924-934. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2019.60.10.924.,20191115,924-934,['(c) Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.'],"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Over last few decades, advances in molecular biology have provided evidence supporting that C. burnetii induces hairiness and inhibits the apoptosis of host cells. The present review summarizes new information in support of cbHC. C. burnetii was shown to induce reorganization of the cytoskeleton and to inhibit apoptosis in host cells. Peritoneal B1a cells were found to be permissive for virulent C. burnetii Nine Mile phase I (NMI) strains in mice. C. burnetii severely impaired E-cad expression in circulating cells of Q fever patients. B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was linked to C. burnetii. Mutation of BRAF V600E was pronounced in HCL, but ""hairiness"" was not linked to the mutation. Risk factors shared among coxiellosis and HCL in humans and animals were reported in patients with Q-fever. Accordingly, I propose that C. burnetii induces reorganization of the cytoskeleton and inhibits apoptosis as cytopathic effects that are not target cell specific. The observed hairiness in cbHC appears to be a fixed image of dynamic nature, and hairy cells in HCL are distinct among lymphoid cells in circulation. As the cytoskeleton plays key roles in maintaining cell structural integrity in health and disease, the pathophysiology of similar cytopathic effects should be addressed in other diseases, such as myopathies, B-cell dyscrasias, and autoimmune syndromes.","['Lee, Won Young']",['Lee WY'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0222-4572'],"['Emeritus Professor, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. wyleegkl@naver.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,PMC6753337,['NOTNLM'],"['C. burnetii-induced hairy cell', 'Coxiella burnetii', 'anti-apoptosis', 'cytoskeleton', 'hairy cell leukemia']",2019/09/21 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2019/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['60.890 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2019.60.10.890 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2019 Oct;60(10):890-897. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2019.60.10.890.,20191115,890-897,['(c) Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.'],,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Coxiella burnetii/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Q Fever/microbiology/pathology']",['The author has no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We integrated multiomics data to construct directed regulatory networks with nodes and edges labeled with chromatin states in human cell lines. We observed extensive association of diverse chromatin states and network motifs. The gene expression analysis showed that diverse chromatin states of coherent type-1 feedforward loop (C1-FFL) and incoherent type-1 feedforward loops (I1-FFL) contributed to the dynamic expression patterns of targets. Notably, diverse chromatin state compositions could help C1- or I1-FFL to control a large number of distinct biological functions in human cell lines, such as four different types of chromatin state compositions cooperating with K562-associated C1-FFLs controlling ""regulation of cytokinesis,"" ""G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle,"" ""DNA recombination,"" and ""telomere maintenance,"" respectively. Remarkably, we identified six chromatin state-marked C1-FFL instances (HCFC1-NFYA-ABL1, THAP1-USF1-BRCA2, ZNF263-USF1-UBA52, MYC-ATF1-UBA52, ELK1-EGR1-CCT4, and YY1-EGR1-INO80C) could act as prognostic biomarkers of acute myelogenous leukemia though influencing cancer-related biological functions, such as cell proliferation, telomere maintenance, and DNA recombination.

In addition, each syndrome shows a predisposition to cancer.

Specialist clinics for each disorder have provided the concentration of expertise needed to tackle their characteristic clinical problems and improve outcomes.

Cell division correlates also with genomic demethylation involving methylation loss in late-replicating partial methylation domains.

Global methylation loss correlated with immune evasion signatures independently of mutation burden and aneuploidy. Methylome data of our cohort (n = 60) and a published cohort (n = 81) in lung cancer and a melanoma cohort (n = 40) consistently demonstrated that genomic methylation alterations counteract the contribution of high mutation burden and increase immunotherapeutic resistance. Higher predictive power was observed for methylation loss than mutation burden. We also found that genomic hypomethylation correlates with the immune escape signatures of aneuploid tumours.

Nonetheless, preclinical studies reported that AML cells frequently exhibit intrinsic resistance to LSD1 inhibition, and the molecular basis for this phenomenon is largely unknown. We explored the potential involvement of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mediating the resistance of leukemic cells to LSD1i. Strikingly, unlike sensitive leukemias, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling was robustly triggered in resistant leukemias following LSD1 inhibition. Transcriptomic, chromatin immunoprecipitation and functional studies revealed that insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS1)/extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) signaling critically controls LSD1i induced mTORC1 activation. Notably, inhibiting mTOR unlocked the resistance of AML cell lines and primary patient-derived blasts to LSD1i both in vitro and in vivo In conclusion, mTOR activation might act as a novel pro-survival mechanism of intrinsic as well as acquired resistance to LSD1i, and combination regimens co-targeting LSD1/mTOR could represent a rational approach in AML therapy.","['Abdel-Aziz, Amal Kamal', 'Pallavicini, Isabella', 'Ceccacci, Elena', 'Meroni, Giuseppe', 'Saadeldin, Mona Kamal', 'Varasi, Mario', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Abdel-Aziz AK', 'Pallavicini I', 'Ceccacci E', 'Meroni G', 'Saadeldin MK', 'Varasi M', 'Minucci S']",,"['Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Experimental Therapeutics IFOM-FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology Foundation, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Biotechnology, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts, 6 October City, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Experimental Therapeutics IFOM-FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology Foundation, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy saverio.minucci@ieo.it.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190919,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7395280,,,2019/09/21 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.224501 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.224501 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Aug;105(8):2105-2117. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.224501.

It can eradicate minimal residual disease or be used to rescue a hematologic relapse, being able to induce durable remissions in a subset of patients. With the increased use of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation, there is renewed interest in the use of donor lymphocytes to either treat or prevent disease relapse post transplant. Published retrospective and small prospective studies have shown encouraging results with therapeutic donor lymphocyte infusion in different haploidentical transplantation platforms. In this consensus paper, finalized on behalf of the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we summarize the available evidence on the use of donor lymphocyte infusion from haploidentical donor, and provide recommendations on its therapeutic, pre-emptive and prophylactic use in clinical practice.","['Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Al Malki, Monzr M', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Fuchs, Ephraim', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Martelli, Massimo', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Ben Soussan, Patrick', 'Arnault, Yolande', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Roy, Denis-Claude', ""O'Donnell, Paul"", 'Bashey, Asad', 'Solomon, Scott', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Lewalle, Philippe', 'Gayoso, Jorge', 'Maschan, Michael', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Ballen, Karen', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dholaria B', 'Savani BN', 'Labopin M', 'Luznik L', 'Ruggeri A', 'Mielke S', 'Al Malki MM', 'Kongtim P', 'Fuchs E', 'Huang XJ', 'Locatelli F', 'Aversa F', 'Castagna L', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Martelli M', 'Blaise D', 'Ben Soussan P', 'Arnault Y', 'Handgretinger R', 'Roy DC', ""O'Donnell P"", 'Bashey A', 'Solomon S', 'Romee R', 'Lewalle P', 'Gayoso J', 'Maschan M', 'Lazarus HM', 'Ballen K', 'Giebel S', 'Baron F', 'Ciceri F', 'Esteve J', 'Gorin NC', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Schmid C', 'Ciurea SO', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']",,"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA bhagirathbhai.r.dholaria@vumc.org.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Haematology and EBMT Paris study office / CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Oncology Hematologic Malignancies, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Cell and Gene Therapy, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, CAST, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing China."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Sapienza, University of Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Instituto Clinico Humanitas, Rozzano Milano, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Gemelli IRCCS, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', ""University of Perugia, Sant'Andrea Delle Fratte, Perugia Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille France.', 'Department of Clinical Psychology, Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Marseille, France.', 'Institut Paoli-Calmette, departement de psychologie clinique, Marseille, France.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen Germany."", 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Northside Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Northside Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'HGU Gregorio Maranon, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Oncology and immunology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center of pediatric hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Adult Hematologic Malignancies & Stem Cell Transplant Section, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Division of hematology/oncology, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Dept. of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Onco-Hematology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute -

Abnormal DNA methylation is a prognostic marker in several malignancies, but its potential prognostic significance in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is poorly defined. Here, we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation to obtain a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of promoter methylation in adult T-ALL (n=24) compared to normal thymi (n=3). We identified a CpG hypermethylator phenotype that distinguishes two T-ALL subgroups and further validated it in an independent series of 17 T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Next, we identified a methylation classifier based on nine promoters which accurately predict the methylation phenotype. This classifier was applied to an independent series of 168 primary adult T-ALL treated accordingly to the GRAALL03/05 trial using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Importantly hypomethylation correlated with specific oncogenic subtypes of T-ALL and identified patients associated with a poor clinical outcome.

Here, we examined their function as determinants of cell resistance to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). To achieve this goal, we compared the expression of microRNAs between complement-resistant and -sensitive K562 leukemia, Raji lymphoma, and HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Global microRNA array analysis identified miR-150, miR-328, and miR-616 as regulators of CDC resistance. Inhibition of miR-150 reduced resistance, whereas inhibition of miR-328 or miR-616 enhanced cell resistance. Treatment of K562 cells with a sublytic dose of complement was shown to rapidly increase miR-150, miR-328, and miR-616 expression. Protein targets of these microRNAs were analyzed in K562 cells by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Expression of the complement membrane regulatory proteins CD46 and CD59 was significantly enhanced after inhibition of miR-328 and miR-616. Enrichment of proteins of mitochondria, known target organelles in CDC, was observed after miR-150, miR-328, and miR-616 inhibition. In conclusion, miR-150, miR-328, and miR-616 regulate cell resistance to CDC by modifying the expression of the membrane complement regulators CD46 and CD59 and the response of the mitochondria to complement lytic attack. These microRNAs may be considered targets for intervention in complement-associated diseases and in anticancer, complement-based therapy.","['Hillman, Yaron', 'Mardamshina, Mariya', 'Pasmanik-Chor, Metsada', 'Ziporen, Lea', 'Geiger, Tamar', 'Shomron, Noam', 'Fishelson, Zvi']","['Hillman Y', 'Mardamshina M', 'Pasmanik-Chor M', 'Ziporen L', 'Geiger T', 'Shomron N', 'Fishelson Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0066-0861'],"['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'The Bioinformatics Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. lifish@tauex.tau.ac.il.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190919,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,,,,2019/09/21 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-18-0818 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0818 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2019 Dec;7(12):1970-1983. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0818.

T cells derived from CLL patients or murine CLL models are skewed to an antigen-experienced T-cell subset, indicating a certain degree of antitumor recognition, but they are also exhausted, preventing an effective antitumor immune response. Here we describe a novel mechanism of CLL tumor immune evasion that is independent of T-cell exhaustion, using B-cell-specific deletion of the transcription factor IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) in Tcl-1 transgenic mice developing a murine CLL highly similar to the human disease. We show enhanced CLL disease progression in IRF4-deficient Tcl-1 tg mice, associated with a severe downregulation of genes involved in T-cell activation, including genes involved in antigen processing/presentation and T-cell costimulation, which massively reduced T-cell subset skewing and exhaustion. We found a strong analogy in the human disease, with inferior prognosis of CLL patients with low IRF4 expression in independent CLL patient cohorts, failed T-cell skewing to antigen-experienced subsets, decreased costimulation capacity, and downregulation of genes involved in T-cell activation. These results have therapeutic relevance because our findings on molecular mechanisms of immune privilege may be responsible for the failure of immune-therapeutic strategies in CLL and may lead to improved targeting in the future.","['Asslaber, Daniela', 'Qi, Yuan', 'Maeding, Nicole', 'Steiner, Markus', 'Denk, Ursula', 'Hopner, Jan Philip', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Zaborsky, Nadja', 'Greil, Richard', 'Egle, Alexander']","['Asslaber D', 'Qi Y', 'Maeding N', 'Steiner M', 'Denk U', 'Hopner JP', 'Hartmann TN', 'Zaborsky N', 'Greil R', 'Egle A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Salzburg, Austria;

Despite reaching U-MRD4, many patients, especially those with unmutated IGHV, subsequently relapse, suggesting residual disease <10-4 threshold and the need for more sensitive MRD evaluation. MRD evaluation by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has a sensitivity of 10-6 (MRD6). To better assess the depth of remission following first-line FCR treatment, we used NGS (Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation) to assess MRD in 62 patients, all of whom had BM U-MRD by multicolor flow cytometry (sensitivity 10-4) at end-of-FCR treatment. Samples from these patients included 57 BM samples, 29 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, and 32 plasma samples. Only 27.4% of the 62 patients had U-MRD by NGS. Rate of U-MRD by NGS was lowest in BM (25%), compared with PBMC (55%) or plasma (75%). No patient with U-MRD by NGS in BM or PBMC was MRD+ in plasma. Patients with mutated IGHV were more likely to have U-MRD by NGS at the end of treatment (EOT; 41% vs 13%, P = .02) than those with unmutated IGHV. Median follow-up was 81.6 months. Patients with U-MRD at EOT had superior PFS vs MRD+ patients, regardless of sample type assessed (BM, P = .02, median not reached [NR] vs 67 months; PBMC, P = .02, median NR vs 74 months).

To explore this further, we extracted clinical trials across all status types registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from 1999 to 2018 studying untreated MDS patients. Using these specific search criteria, we analyzed 317 therapeutic MDS trials based on study status, therapeutic indication, eligibility criteria, and sponsor type to examine if these factors influenced t-MDS patient inclusion. Only 18 studies (5.7%) accrued 231 t-MDS patients in total, representing 3.2% of the total accrued MDS trial patient population. Fewer t-MDS patients were accrued in therapeutic trials sponsored by pharmaceutical sponsors vs nonpharmaceutical sponsors (2.8% vs 4.0%; P = .0073). This pattern of exclusion continues in actively enrolling trials; only 5 (10%) of 49 studies specifically mention the inclusion of t-MDS patients in their eligibility criteria. Our results indicate that therapeutic MDS trials seem to exclude t-MDS patients, rendering study results less applicable to this subset of MDS patients, who often have poor outcomes. Our study emphasizes the importance of the recent focus by National Cancer Institute cooperative groups and societies to broaden eligibility criteria for all patients.","['Borate, Uma', 'Norris, Brianna A', 'Statler, Abby', 'Fu, Rongwei', 'Bucy, Taylor', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Borate U', 'Norris BA', 'Statler A', 'Fu R', 'Bucy T', 'Sekeres MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4958-4962', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2914-1646']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Cancer Biostatistics, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'School of Public Health, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Leukemia Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6759730,,,2019/09/21 06:00,2020/08/15 06:00,['2019/09/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000293 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000293 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Sep 24;3(18):2738-2747. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000293.,20200814,2738-2747,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess risk (AER), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Among patients with DLBCL as a primary malignancy, 3751 patients had second cancer episodes identified, with a SIR of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.16-1.23, P < 0.05). There was a significantly higher risk of tumors/malignancies in the following sites of patients with DLBCL compared with the general population: Oral cavity and pharynx, hepatobiliary system, head and neck, thorax, bone and soft tissue, skin, breasts, urinary tract, and endocrine system. Additionally, leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma occurred more frequently in patients with DLBCL than in the general population. Risk for a subsequent colon/rectum/anus cancer, bone and joint malignancy, and melanoma were significantly elevated in DLBCL patients received beam radiation, while the risk for these malignancies was not significantly increased in those without a radiation record. Notably, for patients under 45 years of age, the risk for SPM was higher than their counterparts in other age groups. CONCLUSION: Our results offer insight into the occurrence of SPM among patients with DLBCL, suggesting awareness of the increased risk of subsequent malignancies is crucial for DLBCL survivors as well as for their physicians.","['Jiang, Shiyu', 'Zhen, Hongnan', 'Jiang, Hongxin']","['Jiang S', 'Zhen H', 'Jiang H']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou, China.

Incidences of infections and mortality were analysed in patients who did not receive prophylactic immunoglobulin therapy. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were normal (7-17.8 g/L) or decreased in 62.37% and 35.48% of patients, respectively. We measured high immunoglobulin levels only in a few cases (2.15%). Immunoglobulin levels became increasingly lower in more advanced disease stages (Rai stages). The number of infections was inversely proportional to that. Hypogammaglobulinaemia proved to be more important than disease progression in terms of the development of infections. The most common infections were upper respiratory tract (33.07%) and sepsis (18.90%). Two months after chemotherapy, initially normal immunoglobulin levels decreased by an average of 21%, and at the same time the incidence of infections increased. The most common cause of death was sepsis: 30% occurred at low immunoglobulin levels, while 20% at normal immunoglobulin levels. According to literature, prophylactic immunoglobulin treatment is indicated in patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemia and immunodeficiency for decreasing both morbidity and mortality. According to recommendations in literature, replacement treatment must be administered in severe or moderately severe recurrent bacterial infections. Immunoglobulin prophylaxis may be provided as low dose (10 g), fix dose (18 g) or individually customized higher dose (300-400 mg/kg body weight) treatment. According to recommendations, higher dose immunoglobulin prophylaxis, administered every three weeks on six occasions, is more efficient when customized. With this dose, infection-free condition may be achieved in 50% of patients.

Presently, scientists are developing other metal drugs as an alternative of cisplatin. In this paper, three new iridium(III) complexes [Ir(ppy)2(adppz)](PF6) (adppz=7-aminodipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine; ppy=2-phenylpyridine 1), [Ir(bzq)2(adppz)](PF6) (bzq=benzo[h]quinolone 2) and [Ir(piq)2(adppz)](PF6) (piq=1-phenylisoquinoline 3) were synthesized and characterized. The complexes can effectively inhibit the cell colonies. The cytotoxicity in vitro of the complexes against A549, HepG2, SGC-7901, BEL-7402 and normal NIH3T3 cells was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole)-2,5-diphenyltetraazolium bromide (MTT) methods. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and Ca(2+) concentrations were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential, a release of cytochrome c and the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family protein have been investigated. The data reveal that the complexes 1-3 can effectively inhibit the cell proliferation in A549 cells with low IC50 value of 3.2+/-0.4muM, 4.8+/-0.5muM and 1.2+/-0.2muM, respectively. The antitumor in vivo shows that complex 3 can inhibit tumor growth with an inhibitory rate of 76.34%. The studies on the mechanism indicate that these complexes cause apoptosis in A549 cell via a ROS-mediated lysosomal-mitochondrial dysfunction pathway. In addition, the interaction of the complexes with BSA was explored.","['Du, Fan', 'Bai, Lan', 'He, Miao', 'Zhang, Wen-Yao', 'Gu, Yi-Ying', 'Yin, Hui', 'Liu, Yun-Jun']","['Du F', 'Bai L', 'He M', 'Zhang WY', 'Gu YY', 'Yin H', 'Liu YJ']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, PR China.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.

So far, many natural and synthetic indole derivatives have been discovered as promising anti-cancer agents used in clinic or clinical evaluations, suggesting its prominent place in anti-cancer drugs development. This review aimed to provide a clear knowledge on the recent development of indoles as anti-cancer agents, such as myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) inhibitors, proviral insertion site in moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog (SIRT) inhibitors and tubulin inhibitors, and made an insight into the corresponding structure-activity relationships (SARs).

Recent data has suggested that i.v. Bu could be the preferred myeloablative regimen in patients with myeloid malignancies. However, Bu-based regimens are associated with higher rates of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Here we report long-term survival outcomes of patients with AML receiving FTBI combined with Cy or etoposide before undergoing alloHCT at City of Hope (COH). We obtained a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained institutional registry of clinical outcomes in 167 patients (median age, 41 years; range, 18 to 57 years) with AML in first or second complete remission who underwent alloHCT at COH between 2005 and 2015. Eligible patients received a MAC regimen with FTBI (1320 cGy) and Cy (120 mg/kg) for unrelated donor transplantation or etoposide (60 mg/kg) for related donor transplantation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was provided with tacrolimus and sirolimus. In this retrospective study, 6-year overall survival was 60% and nonrelapse mortality was 15%. The GRFS rate was 45% at 1 year and 39% at 2 years. We also describe late metabolic effects and report the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies (9.5%). Overall, in this young adult patient population, our results compare favorably to chemotherapy-based (i.v. Bu) conditioning regimens without significant long-term toxicity arising from TBI-based regimens.","['Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Hui, Susanta', 'Yang, Dongyun', 'Mokhtari, Sally', 'Mei, Matthew', 'Al Malki, Monzr M', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Ali, Haris', 'Sandhu, Karamjeet S', 'Aribi, Ahmed', 'Khaled, Samer', 'Dandapani, Savita', 'Peng, Kelly', 'Teh, Jennifer Berano', 'Murata-Collins, Joyce', 'Budde, Elizabeth', 'Dadwal, Sanjeet', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Snyder, David', 'Spielberger, Ricardo', 'Wong, Jeffry', 'Armenian, Saro', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Stein, Anthony']","['Salhotra A', 'Hui S', 'Yang D', 'Mokhtari S', 'Mei M', 'Al Malki MM', 'Aldoss I', 'Ali H', 'Sandhu KS', 'Aribi A', 'Khaled S', 'Dandapani S', 'Peng K', 'Teh JB', 'Murata-Collins J', 'Budde E', 'Dadwal S', 'Pullarkat V', 'Snyder D', 'Spielberger R', 'Wong J', 'Armenian S', 'Marcucci G', 'Forman SJ', 'Nakamura R', 'Stein A']",,"['Department of Hematology and HCT, City of Hope, Duarte, California.

The authors sought to determine the frequency of reduced BMD detected by off-therapy surveillance, factors associated with reduced BMD, and the association of reduced BMD with fractures. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included childhood leukemia/lymphoma survivors attending 2 survivorship clinics who received guideline-recommended BMD surveillance >/=2 years post-therapy with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (from January 1, 2004 to August 31, 2016). Lumbar spine BMD z-scores were height-for-age-adjusted. Low and very low BMD were >1 SD and >2 SDs below norms, respectively. Treatment, chronic conditions, and fractures were abstracted from medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of low BMD with patient/treatment factors and fractures. RESULTS: In total, 542 patients (51.5% female) with a mean age of 15.5 years (range, 4.4-52.2 years) who were 6 years post-therapy (range, 2.0-35.1 years) were evaluated, including 116 who reported post-therapy fractures. Lumbar spine low BMD was identified in 17.2% of survivors, and very low BMD was identified in 3.5% of survivors, but frequencies varied considerably between subgroups; 10.8% of survivors aged 15 to 19 years at diagnosis had very low BMD. In multivariable analyses, older age at diagnosis, white race, and being underweight were significantly associated with low BMD. Survivors with low BMD had greater odds of nondigit fractures (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7) and specifically long-bone fractures (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5-4.7). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of childhood leukemia/lymphoma survivors undergoing guideline-recommended dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry surveillance, patients who were older at diagnosis, white, and underweight were at the highest risk for lumbar spine low BMD. Low BMD was associated with a greater risk of fractures, emphasizing the clinical importance of surveillance.","['Bloomhardt, Hadley M', 'Sint, Kyaw', 'Ross, Wilhelmenia L', 'Rotatori, Jaime', 'Ness, Kathryn', 'Robinson, Cemre', 'Carpenter, Thomas O', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Bloomhardt HM', 'Sint K', 'Ross WL', 'Rotatori J', 'Ness K', 'Robinson C', 'Carpenter TO', 'Chow EJ', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6857-396X'],"['Department of Pediatrics (Hematology-Oncology), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pediatrics (Hematology-Oncology), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pediatrics (Hematology-Oncology), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."", 'Department of Pediatrics (Endocrinology), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pediatrics (Endocrinology), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pediatrics (Hematology-Oncology), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190919,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone mineral density', '*cancer survivors', '*childhood cancer', '*dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan', '*fractures', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/07/03 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32512 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Jan 1;126(1):202-210. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32512.

The NOD-scidIL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice engrafted with human cord blood (hCB)-CD34+ cells have been proposed to be a valuable tool to reproduce human immune system in mouse. However, the lack of solid evidences on the functionality of their human immune components limits their usage in immune-oncology. We report that (hCB)-CD34+ cells lose their ability to propagate and originate bone marrow-derived human immune cells after two serial transplantations in NSG mice. We demonstrate that transplants of bone marrow patient-derived acute myeloid leukemias (hAMLs) grow very similarly in the humanized (hCB)-CD34+ NSG and parental NSG mice. The similar extent of engraftment and development of leukemias in (hCB)-CD34+ NSG and controls suggests a poor human immune response against not compatible hAMLs. Our findings suggest that (hCB)-CD34+ NSG mice are transient and/or incomplete carriers of the human immune system and, therefore, represent a suboptimal tool to study the interaction between tumor and immune cells.","['Tanaskovic, Olga', 'Verga Falzacappa, Maria Vittoria', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Tanaskovic O', 'Verga Falzacappa MV', 'Pelicci PG']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2477-9015'],"['Department of Experimental Oncology at the IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology at the IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology at the IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190919,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6752751,,,2019/09/20 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0217345 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-32291 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Sep 19;14(9):e0217345. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217345. eCollection 2019.,20200311,e0217345,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about underlying mechanisms, but DNA methylation is altered in RA and ALL, and in response to infection. We investigated if aberrant methylation may be in common between these diseases and associated with infection. Materials & methods: RA and ALL disease-associated methylation signatures were compared and related to exposure-to-infection signatures. Results: A significant number of genes overlapped between RA and ALL signatures (p = 0.0019). Significant overlaps were observed between exposure-to-infection signatures and disease-associated signatures. Conclusion: DNA methylation may be a mediating mechanism through which the hygiene hypothesis is associated with RA and ALL risk.","['Langie, Sabine As', 'Timms, Jessica A', 'De Boever, Patrick', 'McKay, Jill A']","['Langie SA', 'Timms JA', 'De Boever P', 'McKay JA']",,"['VITO-Health, 2400 Mol, Belgium.', 'Centre for Environmental Sciences, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, 3590, Belgium.', 'Institute for Health & Society, Human Nutrition Research Centre, Newcastle University, NE2 4HH, UK.', ""Systems Cancer Immunology Lab, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Research Oncology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, SE1 9RT, UK."", 'VITO-Health, 2400 Mol, Belgium.', 'Centre for Environmental Sciences, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, 3590, Belgium.', 'Institute for Health & Society, Human Nutrition Research Centre, Newcastle University, NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Faculty of Health & Life Sciences, Department of Applied Sciences, Northumbria University, NE1 8ST, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190919,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*allergy', '*childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cold symptoms', '*day care', '*epigenetics', '*exposure', '*hygiene hypothesis', '*infection', '*proxy']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/05/26 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/epi-2019-0052 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2019 Oct;11(13):1519-1537. doi: 10.2217/epi-2019-0052.

The aim was to quantify the release of CXCL8, -9, -10, CCL2, -5, and IL-12 in AML/MDS-pts' serum by cytometric bead array and to correlate data with clinical subtypes and courses. Minimal differences in serum-levels subdivided into various groups (e.g. age groups, FAB-types, blast-proportions, cytogenetic-risk-groups) were seen, but higher release of CXCL8, -9, -10 and lower release of CCL2 and -5 tendentially correlated with more favorable subtypes (<50 years of age, <80% blasts in PB). Comparing different stages of the disease higher CCL5-release in persisting disease and a significantly higher CCL2-release at relapse were found compared to first diagnosis - pointing to a change of 'disease activity' on a chemokine level. Correlations with later on achieved response to immunotherapy and occurrence of GVHD were seen: Higher values of CXCL8, -9, -10 and CCL2 and lower CCL5-values correlated with achieved response to immunotherapy. Predictive cut-off-values were evaluated separating the groups in 'responders' and 'non-responders'. Higher levels of CCL2 and -5 but lower levels of CXCL8, -9, -10 correlated with occurrence of GVHD. We conclude, that in AML-pts' serum higher values of CXCL8, -9, -10 and lower values of CCL5 and in part of CCL2 correlate with more favorable subtypes and improved antitumor'-reactive function. This knowledge can contribute to develop immune-modifying strategies that promote antileukemic adaptive immune responses.","['Merle, M', 'Fischbacher, D', 'Liepert, A', 'Grabrucker, C', 'Kroell, T', 'Kremser, A', 'Dreyssig, J', 'Freudenreich, M', 'Schuster, F', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Kraemer, D', 'Koehne, C-H', 'Kolb, H J', 'Schmid, C', 'Schmetzer, H M']","['Merle M', 'Fischbacher D', 'Liepert A', 'Grabrucker C', 'Kroell T', 'Kremser A', 'Dreyssig J', 'Freudenreich M', 'Schuster F', 'Borkhardt A', 'Kraemer D', 'Koehne CH', 'Kolb HJ', 'Schmid C', 'Schmetzer HM']",,"['Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Municipal Hospital Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Municipal Hospital Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Center, Clinical Cooperative Group Human Cell Transplantation (CCG-HCT), Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Transplantations, Med III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Center, Clinical Cooperative Group Human Cell Transplantation (CCG-HCT), Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190919,England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dendritic cells', 'T-cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemokines', 'immunotherapy']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08820139.2019.1661429 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2020 May;49(4):365-385. doi: 10.1080/08820139.2019.1661429.

METHODS: The RNA sequencing and DNA methylation of 23 patients with -5/del(5q) or -7/del(7q) and 128 patients with other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The regulatory mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and DNA methylation on gene expression were explored. To find robust and specific risk stratification for this AML subtype, a prognostic model was established and evaluated through four independent data sets. RESULTS: We identified 966 differentially expressed long noncoding RNA, 2274 differentially expressed genes, and 47 differentially expressed microRNAs, and constructed a ceRNA network. After the integrated analysis of differentially methylated and expressed genes, 19 genes showed the opposite trend between the methylation variation and gene expression. An six-methylated-gene prognostic signature which highly correlated with overall survival was established, and the performance was validated by leave-one-out cross validation method and permutation test. Furthermore, the excellent prognostic value of this model was supported by an independent cohort, while specificity of this model was validated by three independent data sets, suggesting it as a predictive classifier with high efficiency for distinguishing those with -5/del(5q) or -7/del(7q) from other AML subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The ceRNA network may provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment for patients with -5/del(5q) or -7/del(7q).The six-methylated-gene prognostic signature was a robust, specific, and clinically practical risk stratification for the outcome of patients with AML having -5/del(5q) or -7/del(7q).","['Yin, Xuejiao', 'Huang, Sui', 'Xu, Aoshuang', 'Fan, Fengjuan', 'Chen, Lei', 'Sun, Chunyan', 'Hu, Yu']","['Yin X', 'Huang S', 'Xu A', 'Fan F', 'Chen L', 'Sun C', 'Hu Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2815-4568'],"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190918,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CpG island', '*ceRNA network', '*methylation', '*prognosis', '*-5/del(5q)', '*-7/del(7q)']",2019/09/20 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29391 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Feb;121(2):1563-1574. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29391.

Here, we report that knockout of Slc1a5 (ASCT2), a transporter of neutral AAs, especially glutamine, results in mild to moderate defects in bone marrow and mature blood cell development under steady state conditions. In contrast, constitutive or induced deletion of Slc1a5 decreases leukemia initiation and maintenance driven by the oncogene MLL-AF9 or Pten deficiency. Survival of leukemic mice is prolonged following Slc1a5 deletion, and pharmacological inhibition of ASCT2 also decreases leukemia development and progression in xenograft models of human acute myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, loss of ASCT2 generates a global effect on cellular metabolism, disrupts leucine influx and mTOR signaling, and induces apoptosis in leukemic cells. Given the substantial difference in reliance on ASCT2-mediated AA metabolism between normal and malignant blood cells, this in vivo study suggests ASCT2 as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia.","['Ni, Fang', 'Yu, Wen-Mei', 'Li, Zhiguo', 'Graham, Douglas K', 'Jin, Lingtao', 'Kang, Sumin', 'Rossi, Michael R', 'Li, Shiyong', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Ni F', 'Yu WM', 'Li Z', 'Graham DK', 'Jin L', 'Kang S', 'Rossi MR', 'Li S', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Qu CK']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.', 'Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology.', 'Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK092722/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL130995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190311,Germany,Nat Metab,Nature metabolism,101736592,PMC6750232,,,2019/09/20 06:00,2019/09/20 06:01,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/s42255-019-0039-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Metab. 2019 Mar;1(3):390-403. doi: 10.1038/s42255-019-0039-6.

This study aimed to determine the occurrence of one or both viruses, the risk factors associated with infection, and to develop further recommendations. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Veterinary Faculty of Eduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique, between March and December 2017, in 145 cats. From each of 145 cats, we took 1.5 ml of blood by jugular puncture for detection of antibodies to FIV and FeLV antigens in whole blood using a commercial test kit, DFV Test FeLV/FIV. Results: We found an overall prevalence of 11.0% and 14.5% for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens, respectively, with four (2.8%) cats coinfected by both pathogens. Male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-4.0) compared with female cats. Clinically ill cats were more likely to have a positive result for FeLV antigen infection (OR 18.8, 95% CI 5.2-68.3). Moreover, cats living in suburban areas have a greater chance of a positive result for FeLV infection (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4-9.6) compared with cats living in urban areas. Conclusions and relevance: FIV and FeLV occur in cats from Maputo and possibly all over the country. Further studies should be conducted in Mozambique and other African countries to define the burden of both pathogens in cats, coinfection with other zoonotic pathogens and the possible role played by the cats on the transmission of zoonotic and opportunistic diseases to humans.","['Tchamo, Cesaltina Clm', 'De Rugeriis, Monica', 'Noormahomed, Emilia V']","['Tchamo CC', 'De Rugeriis M', 'Noormahomed EV']",,"['Department of Clinics, Veterinary Faculty, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.', 'Department of Clinics, Veterinary Faculty, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Disease Division, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Mozambique Institute for Health Education and Research (MIHER), Maputo, Mozambique.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190910,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,PMC6737869,['NOTNLM'],"['Feline immunodeficiency virus', 'Maputo city', 'Maputo province', 'Mozambique', 'feline leukaemia virus', 'retrovirus']",2019/09/20 06:00,2019/09/20 06:01,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116919870877 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116919870877 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2019 Sep 10;5(2):2055116919870877. doi: 10.1177/2055116919870877. eCollection 2019 Jul-Dec.,,2055116919870877,,,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,

It functions in many cellular processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis, intracellular trafficking, cell proliferation, signaling, immortalization and tumorigenesis. Thus, inhibition of mortalin is a promising avenue for cancer therapy. Previous studies in our lab have suggested that mortalin contributes to breast cancer development and progression. We showed that tumor extracellular vesicle secretion was decreased by knockdown of mortalin expression using HIV-1 Nef SMR peptides. Specifically, these peptides can block extracellular vesicle secretion and mediate cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Aims: This study aims to investigate further the function and mechanism of interaction of PEG-SMR-CLU and SMR-CPP peptides with the chaperone protein mortalin and to explore the effect of SMR-derived peptides and mortalin expression on extracellular vesicle release and complement dependent cell toxicity in human breast cancer and leukemia cell lines. Results: Our results demonstrated additional effects reversing the tumorigenicity of these cells. First, the modified SMRwt peptides reduced the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM). Second, exposure to the SMRwt peptide inhibited mortalin and complement C9 expression in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 breast cancer cells and K562 leukemia cells as measured by the Western blot analysis. Third, the SMRwt peptides blocked the cancer cells' ability to release extracellular vesicles, which we observed blocked extracellular vesicle-mediated release of complement, re-establishing complements mediated cell death in those peptide-treated cells. Methods: We developed a series of peptides derived from the Secretion Modification Region (SMR) of HIV-1 Nef protein, modified by the addition of either a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), a positively charged arginine-rich peptide derived from HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat, or a Clusterin-binding peptide (CLU), a molecular chaperone involved in protein secretion. Both CPP and CLU peptide sequences were added at the C-terminus of the Nef SMR peptide. The CLU-containing peptides were also modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance solubility. After treatment of cells with the peptides, we used the MTT cell viability and complement-mediated cytotoxicity assays to confirm the inhibitory role of modified SMRwt peptides on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells and K562 leukemia cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine complement mediated cell apoptosis and death. Western blot analysis was used to track SMR peptides impact on expression of mortalin, vimentin and complement C9 and to measure the expression of extracellular vesicle proteins. NanoSight analysis and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assay were used for measuring extracellular vesicles particle size and concentration and acetylcholinesterase. Conclusions: Mortalin promotes cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, downregulate apoptotic signaling. Thus, mortalin is a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. The novel SMRwt peptides antagonize the functions of mortalin, blocking tumor extracellular vesicle release and extracellular vesicle-mediated release of complement. This leads to decreases in breast cancer cell metastasis and allows standard treatment of these late stage tumor cells, thus having important clinical implications for late stage breast cancer chemotherapy. These findings support further investigation into the therapeutic value of the SMR peptide in cancer metastasis.","['Huang, Ming-Bo', 'Wu, Jennifer Y', 'Lillard, James', 'Bond, Vincent C']","['Huang MB', 'Wu JY', 'Lillard J', 'Bond VC']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA.', 'Columbia College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA.']",['eng'],"['U54 MD007588/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002378/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20190910,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6739210,['NOTNLM'],"['SMR peptides', 'breast cancer', 'complement', 'extracellular vesicles', 'mortalin']",2019/09/20 06:00,2019/09/20 06:01,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27138 [doi]', '27138 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Sep 10;10(52):5419-5438. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27138. eCollection 2019 Sep 10.,,5419-5438,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that there are no potential conflicts', 'of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Exosomes have emerged as an essential mediator of cell-cell communication. Whether leukemic exosomes involved in bone marrow niche remodeling remains unknown. Methods: We investigated the role of leukemic exosomes in molecular and functional changes of BMMSC in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics were employed to screen for miRNAs that are selectively sorted into leukemic exosomes and the corresponding RNA binding proteins. Results: We demonstrated that leukemia cells significantly inhibited osteogenesis by BMMSC both in vivo and in vitro. Some tumor suppressive miRNAs, especially miR-320, were enriched in exosomes and thus secreted by leukemic cells, resulting in increased proliferation of the donor cells. In turn, the secreted exosomes were significantly endocytosed by adjacent BMMSC and thus inhibited osteogenesis at least partially via beta-catenin inhibition. Mechanistically, miR-320 and some other miRNAs were sorted out into the exosomes by RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), as these miRNAs harbor the recognition site for HNRNPA1. Conclusion: HNRNPA1-mediated exosomal transfer of miR-320 from leukemia cells to BMMSC is an important mediator of leukemia progression and is a potential therapeutic target for CML.","['Gao, Xiaotong', 'Wan, Zhuo', 'Wei, Mengying', 'Dong, Yan', 'Zhao, Yingxin', 'Chen, Xutao', 'Li, Zhelong', 'Qin, Weiwei', 'Yang, Guodong', 'Liu, Li']","['Gao X', 'Wan Z', 'Wei M', 'Dong Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Chen X', 'Li Z', 'Qin W', 'Yang G', 'Liu L']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Implantation, School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Ultrasound Diagnostics, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710038, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190728,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,PMC6735391,['NOTNLM'],"['*HNRNPA1', '*bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells', '*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*exosomes', '*miR-320']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.34813 [doi]', 'thnov09p5642 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2019 Jul 28;9(19):5642-5656. doi: 10.7150/thno.34813. eCollection 2019.,20200909,5642-5656,,"['0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Hnrnpa1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn320 microRNA, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exosomes/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a regional retrospective study in the ATL endemic area of Okinawa, Japan. Of 62 ATL patients, 21 received allo-HSCT in CR and 41 in non-CR. The 3-year overall survival (3yOS) rate and median survival time for the whole cohort was 25.6% and 7.7 months, respectively. The 3yOS of Pt-non-CR was significantly lower than that of patients in CR (Pt-CR) (16.8% vs. 43.6%, P = 0.005). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher in Pt-non-CR than in Pt-CR (46.3% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.025), while there was no significant difference in disease-associated mortality (DAM) between Pt-non-CR and Pt-CR. Multivariable analysis for Pt-non-CR revealed that poor performance status (poor-PS) and higher sIL-2R level (high sIL-2R) adversely affected OS. Poor-PS was associated with higher TRM, but not with higher DAM in Pt-non-CR. High sIL-2R did not affect TRM or DAM in Pt-non-CR. Overall, high TRM rates rather than DAM contribute to the poor outcomes of Pt-non-CR, suggesting that not only disease control but also management of transplant-related complications is required for allo-HSCT in ATL patients.","['Tomori, Shouhei', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Nishi, Yukiko', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Tamaki, Keita', 'Morichika, Kazuho', 'Tedokon, Iori', 'Shimabukuro, Natsuki', 'Hanashiro, Taeko', 'Kitamura, Sakiko', 'Uchibori, Sachie', 'Miyagi, Riko', 'Miyagi, Takashi', 'Karimata, Kaori', 'Ohama, Masayo', 'Yamanoha, Atsushi', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Masuzaki, Hiroaki']","['Tomori S', 'Morishima S', 'Nishi Y', 'Nakachi S', 'Tamaki K', 'Morichika K', 'Tedokon I', 'Shimabukuro N', 'Hanashiro T', 'Kitamura S', 'Uchibori S', 'Miyagi R', 'Miyagi T', 'Karimata K', 'Ohama M', 'Yamanoha A', 'Tomoyose T', 'Karube K', 'Fukushima T', 'Masuzaki H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-4271'],"['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan. smorishi@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heartlife Hospital, Nakagusuku, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heartlife Hospital, Nakagusuku, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heartlife Hospital, Nakagusuku, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heartlife Hospital, Nakagusuku, Okinawa, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Okinawa Prefectual Nambu Medical Center and Children's Medical Center, Haebaru, Okinawa, Japan."", 'Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190918,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,PMC7091703,,,2019/09/20 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0669-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0669-z [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jan;55(1):233-241. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0669-z.

Recipients of alloHCT are at high risk for CD infection but large studies in this population are rare and conflicting results have been reported. We analyzed 727 patients with AML or MDS undergoing alloHCT in our center from 2004 to 2015. Ninety-six patients (13%) had CD infection and 103 patients (14%) were identified as asymptomatic carriers by screening at admission and once a week during aplasia. Patients with CD infection had a shorter median overall survival of 8 months (95% CI, 6-36 months) compared with 25 months (95% CI, 17-35 months) for patients without CD infection, (HR 1.4, p = 0.04). CD positive patients were less likely to develop acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD; HR 0.6, p = 0.004) compared with CD-negative patients, but did not show differences in gastrointestinal aGvHD (HR 0.9, p = 0.5).

Flow cytometric analysis of CSF improves detection of CNS leukemia, distinguishes patients with high and low risk of relapse, and may improve future risk stratification and CNS-directed therapy.","['Thastrup, Maria', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke', 'Levinsen, Mette', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Albertsen, Birgitte Klug', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi Maria', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Pronk, Cornelis Jan', 'Ulvmoen, Aina', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Thastrup M', 'Marquart HV', 'Levinsen M', 'Grell K', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Albertsen BK', 'Frandsen TL', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Niinimaki R', 'Pronk CJ', 'Ulvmoen A', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Taskinen M', 'Schmiegelow K']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0073-9660', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0829-4993']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Children and Adolescent Health, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and Turku University, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital and PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos and Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. kjeld.schmiegelow@regionh.dk.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. kjeld.schmiegelow@regionh.dk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190918,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/09/20 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0570-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0570-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Feb;34(2):336-346. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0570-1.

We previously found that PAX7 recruits the H3K4 methyltransferases MLL1/2 to epigenetically activate target genes. Here we report that in the absence of Mll1, myoblasts exhibit reduced H3K4me3 at both Pax7 and Myf5 promoters and reduced Pax7 and Myf5 expression. Mll1-deficient myoblasts fail to proliferate but retain their differentiation potential, while deletion of Mll2 had no discernable effect. Re-expression of PAX7 in committed Mll1 cKO myoblasts restored H3K4me3 enrichment at the Myf5 promoter and Myf5 expression. Deletion of Mll1 in satellite cells reduced satellite cell proliferation and self-renewal, and significantly impaired skeletal muscle regeneration. Pax7 expression was unaffected in quiescent satellite cells but was markedly downregulated following satellite cell activation. Therefore, MLL1 is required for PAX7 expression and satellite cell function in vivo. Furthermore, PAX7, but not MLL1, is required for Myf5 transcriptional activation in committed myoblasts.","['Addicks, Gregory C', 'Brun, Caroline E', 'Sincennes, Marie-Claude', 'Saber, John', 'Porter, Christopher J', 'Francis Stewart, A', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Rudnicki, Michael A']","['Addicks GC', 'Brun CE', 'Sincennes MC', 'Saber J', 'Porter CJ', 'Francis Stewart A', 'Ernst P', 'Rudnicki MA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2047-1964', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3866-5249']","['Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Ottawa Bioinformatics Core Facility, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Genomics, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Tatzberg 47, Dresden, 01307, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, University of Colorado/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada. mrudnicki@ohri.ca.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada. mrudnicki@ohri.ca.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR044031/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'FDN-148387/CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190918,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC6751293,,,2019/09/20 06:00,2020/01/04 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-12086-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-12086-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Sep 18;10(1):4256. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12086-9.,20200103,4256,,"['0 (Myf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5)', '0 (PAX7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Pax7 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Myoblasts/*metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5/genetics/*metabolism', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated ERV-DC in European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) and detected four loci: ERV-DC6, ERV-DC7, ERV-DC14, and ERV-DC16. ERV-DC14 was detected at a high frequency in European wildcats; however, it was replication defective due to a single G --> A nucleotide substitution, resulting in an E148K substitution in the ERV-DC14 envelope (Env). This mutation results in a cleavage-defective Env that is not incorporated into viral particles. Introduction of the same mutation into feline and murine infectious gammaretroviruses resulted in a similar Env dysfunction. Interestingly, the same mutation was found in an FeLV isolate from naturally occurring thymic lymphoma and a mouse ERV, suggesting a common mechanism of virus inactivation. Refrex-1 was present in European wildcats; however, ERV-DC16, but not ERV-DC7, was unfixed in European wildcats. Thus, Refrex-1 has had an antiviral role throughout the evolution of the genus Felis, predating cat exposure to feline retroviruses. ERV-DC sequence diversity was present across wild and domestic cats but was locus dependent. In conclusion, ERVs have evolved species-specific phenotypes through the interplay between ERVs and their hosts. The mechanism of viral inactivation may be similar irrespective of the evolutionary history of retroviruses. The tracking of ancestral retroviruses can shed light on their roles in pathogenesis and host-virus evolution.IMPORTANCE Domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) were domesticated from wildcats approximately 9,000 years ago via close interaction between humans and cats. During cat evolution, various exogenous retroviruses infected different cat lineages and generated numerous ERVs in the host genome, some of which remain replication competent. Here, we detected several ERV-DC loci in Felis silvestris silvestris Notably, a species-specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the ERV-DC14 env gene, which results in a replication-defective product, is highly prevalent in European wildcats, unlike the replication-competent ERV-DC14 that is commonly present in domestic cats. The presence of the same lethal mutation in the env genes of both FeLV and murine ERV provides a common mechanism shared by endogenous and exogenous retroviruses by which ERVs can be inactivated after endogenization. The antiviral role of Refrex-1 predates cat exposure to feline retroviruses. The existence of two ERV-DC14 phenotypes provides a unique model for understanding both ERV fate and cat domestication.","['Ngo, Minh Ha', 'Arnal, MariaCruz', 'Sumi, Ryosuke', 'Kawasaki, Junna', 'Miyake, Ariko', 'Grant, Chris K', 'Otoi, Takeshige', 'Fernandez de Luco, Daniel', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Ngo MH', 'Arnal M', 'Sumi R', 'Kawasaki J', 'Miyake A', 'Grant CK', 'Otoi T', 'Fernandez de Luco D', 'Nishigaki K']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Departamento de Patologia Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Custom Monoclonals International, West Sacramento, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Animal Reproduction, Faculty of Bioscience and Bioindustry, Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Departamento de Patologia Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan kaz@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191126,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC6880155,['NOTNLM'],"['*ERV-DC', '*FeLV', '*Felis', '*Fv-4', '*MuLV', '*domestic cat', '*domestication', '*endogenous retrovirus', '*evolution', '*wildcat']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01324-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01324-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Nov 26;93(24). pii: JVI.01324-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01324-19.

Circ-Foxo3 is a circular structure which connects the 3'end to the 5'end. Scholars detected that circ-Foxo3 could compete with Foxo3 for binding to some miRNAs. METHODS: In this study, we will test the expression of Foxo3 and circ-Foxo3 in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to explore the relationship between Foxo3 gene and circ-Foxo3. All the de novo AML samples and normal control samples was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. A receiver operating characteristic curve was conducted to differentiate AML patients from control people. Association of Foxo3 expression and overall survival was conducted by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: We found that the expression of Foxo3 gene in de novo patients was significantly lower than control samples (P = 0.009). Meanwhile, circ-Foxo3 also expressed lower in de novo AML patients than in control samples (P = 0.040). In different classifications, this trend could be observed more remarkably. In non-M3 patients, the Foxo3 high patients' survival time was longer than Foxo3 low patients (P = 0.002). Besides, in non-favorable risk groups, patients with low expression of Foxo3 had longer survival time than Foxo3 high patients (P = 0.004). Furthermore, in normal Karyotypic patients, the overall survival time of patients with high-expressed Foxo3 was significantly longer than those with low expression (P = 0.034). Besides, Pearson analysis was also conducted between these two genes in AML patients. Results revealed that they were positively correlated (R = 0.63, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that low expression of circ-Foxo3 and Foxo3 were frequent in AML patients, and patients with high expression of Foxo3 often had a trend of better prognosis.","['Zhou, Jiao', 'Zhou, Ling-Yu', 'Tang, Xi', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Zhai, Ling-Ling', 'Yi, Yun Yun', 'Yi, Jing', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun']","['Zhou J', 'Zhou LY', 'Tang X', 'Zhang J', 'Zhai LL', 'Yi YY', 'Yi J', 'Lin J', 'Qian J', 'Deng ZQ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0037-4697'],"[""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. zqdeng2002@163.com."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. zqdeng2002@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['81172592/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81270630/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20190918,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6751826,['NOTNLM'],"['Better prognosis', 'Circular RNA, acute myeloid leukemia', 'Foxo3']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5967-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5967-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Sep 18;19(1):930. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5967-8.,20200213,930,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (RNA, Circular)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Circular/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We review FLT3 glycosylation in endoplasmic reticulum. The abnormal signal of mutant FLT3 with different glycosylation status is discussed. We also address potential FLT3 glycosylation-targeting strategies for the treatment. Results: Inhibition of FLT3 mutant cells by drugs reported in recent literatures involves the influence of glycosylation of FLT3: 2-deoxy-D-glucose, Tunicamycin and Fluvastatin are reported to inhibit N-glycosylation of FLT3; Pim-1 inhibitors are proved to block the inhibition of Pim-1 on FLT3 Oglycosylation; HSP90 inhibitors and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors are shown to increase fully glycosylated form of FLT3. Discussion: The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene expressed only in CD34+ progenitor cells in bone marrow is located on chromosome 13q12 encoding FLT3 protein. FLT3 is initially synthesized as a 110 KD protein, which glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum to a 130 KD immature protein rich in mannose, and further processed into a mature 160 KD protein in the Golgi apparatus, which could be transferred to the cell surface. Therapy targeting on FLT3 glycosylation is a promising direction for AML treatment. Conclusions: The abnormal location of FLT3 caused by different glycosylation status leads to the distinguishing signaling pathways. Targeting on FLT3 glycosylation may provide a new perspective for therapeutic strategies.

However, despite its general efficacy across the spectrum of B-LPDs, certain subtypes are characterized by significantly higher response rates (RRs) to venetoclax (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukemia) than others (e.g. diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). This variation in RR is the result of an underlying spectrum of primary (intrinsic) resistance to venetoclax mediated by numerous intracellular and microenvironmental mechanisms. Moreover, despite an initial response, most patients will experience disease progression on venetoclax therapy thus manifesting secondary (acquired) resistance. This review describes the molecular mechanisms in B-LPDs that drive both of these types of clinical resistance, the understanding of which is central to optimizing outcomes using this therapy.","['Blombery, Piers']",['Blombery P'],,"['Department of Clinical Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190918,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Drug resistance', '*cell cycle and apoptosis changes', '*lymphoma and Hodgkin disease']",2019/09/20 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1660974 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Feb;61(2):257-262. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1660974.

There have been significant advances in developing statistical methods to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with binary disease status. Most of these methods are being developed for detecting differential methylation rates between cases and controls. We consider multiple severity levels of disease, and develop a Bayesian statistical method to detect the region with increasing (or decreasing) methylation rates as the disease severity increases. Patients are classified into more than two groups, based on the disease severity (e.g., stages of cancer), and DMRs are detected by using moving windows along the genome. Within each window, the Bayes factor is calculated to test the hypothesis of monotonic increase in methylation rates corresponding to severity of the disease versus no difference. A mixed-effect model is used to incorporate the correlation of methylation rates of nearby CpG sites in the region. Results from extensive simulation indicate that our proposed method is statistically valid and reasonably powerful. We demonstrate our approach on a bisulfite sequencing dataset from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) study.","['Dunbar, Fengjiao', 'Xu, Hongyan', 'Ryu, Duchwan', 'Ghosh, Santu', 'Shi, Huidong', 'George, Varghese']","['Dunbar F', 'Xu H', 'Ryu D', 'Ghosh S', 'Shi H', 'George V']",,"['Genomics Research Center, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA. fengjiao.dunbar@abbvie.com.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. hxu@augusta.edu.', 'Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 60178, USA. dryu@niu.edu.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. sghosh@augusta.edu.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. hshi@augusta.edu.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. vgeorge@augusta.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190917,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC6770971,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bayes factor', '*Bayesian mixed-effect model', '*CpG sites', '*DNA methylation', '*Ordinal responses']",2019/09/20 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['genes10090721 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10090721 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Sep 17;10(9). pii: genes10090721. doi: 10.3390/genes10090721.,20200210,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

As a potential treatment tool for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, we developed and analyzed two new PGE1-containing protocols (Pici-PGE1, Kit M) to generate DC/DCleu ex vivo from leukemic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or directly from leukemic whole blood (WB) to simulate physiological conditions. Pici-PGE1 generated significantly higher amounts of DCs from leukemic and healthy PBMCs when compared to control and comparable amounts as the already established protocol Pici-PGE2. The proportions of sufficient DC-generation were even higher after DC/DCleu-generation with Pici-PGE1. With Kits, it was possible to generate DCs and DCleu directly from leukemic and healthy WB without induction of blast proliferation. The average amounts of generated DCs and DCleu-subgroups were comparable with all Kits.

Software solutions and extensive compound libraries facilitate the efficient analysis of MS(1) data, regardless of the analytical platform. However, the development of comparable tools for DIA data analysis has significantly lagged. This research introduces an update to the former MetaboList R package and a workflow for full-scan MS(1) and MS/MS DIA processing of metabolomic data from multiplexed liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) experiments. When compared to the former version, new functions have been added to address isolated MS(1) and MS/MS workflows, processing of MS/MS data from stepped collision energies, performance scoring of metabolite annotations, and batch job analysis were incorporated into the update. The flexibility and efficiency of this strategy were assessed through the study of the metabolite profiles of human urine, leukemia cell culture, and medium samples analyzed by either liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (q-TOF) or quadrupole orbital (q-Orbitrap) instruments. This open-source alternative was designed to promote global metabolomic strategies based on recursive retrospective research of multiplexed DIA analysis.","['Peris-Diaz, Manuel D', 'Sweeney, Shannon R', 'Rodak, Olga', 'Sentandreu, Enrique', 'Tiziani, Stefano']","['Peris-Diaz MD', 'Sweeney SR', 'Rodak O', 'Sentandreu E', 'Tiziani S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4157-580X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7230-0307']","['Department of Chemical Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, J.Curie 14a, 50-383 Wroclaw, Poland. manuel.perisdiaz@uwr.edu.pl.', 'Unidad Analitica, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe (IIS La Fe), 46026 Valencia, Spain. manuel.perisdiaz@uwr.edu.pl.', 'Dell Pediatric Research Institute (DPRI), University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78723, USA. ssweeney@utexas.edu.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78723, USA. ssweeney@utexas.edu.', 'Department of Reproduction and Clinic of Farm Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, 50-366 Wroclaw, Poland. olga.rodak@upwr.edu.pl.', 'Unidad Analitica, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe (IIS La Fe), 46026 Valencia, Spain. infusoriosentandreu@gmail.com.', 'Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de Alimentos (IATA-CSIC), Paterna, 46980 Valencia, Spain. infusoriosentandreu@gmail.com.', 'Dell Pediatric Research Institute (DPRI), University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78723, USA. tiziani@austin.utexas.edu.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78723, USA. tiziani@austin.utexas.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA189623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CPRIT RP180309/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas', '2018/31/N/ST4/01909/National Science Center of Poland', 'CA206210-R01, CA189623/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20190917,Switzerland,Metabolites,Metabolites,101578790,PMC6780920,['NOTNLM'],"['R programming', 'R-MetaboList 2', 'all ion fragmentation', 'data-independent acquisition', 'full-scan MS/MS processing', 'liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'targeted analysis', 'untargeted analysis']",2019/09/20 06:00,2019/09/20 06:01,['2019/09/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:01 [medline]']","['metabo9090187 [pii]', '10.3390/metabo9090187 [doi]']",epublish,Metabolites. 2019 Sep 17;9(9). pii: metabo9090187. doi: 10.3390/metabo9090187.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation generates the RUNX1-ETO fusion protein, which interferes with the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1. We previously showed that the maintenance of t(8;21) AML is dependent on RUNX1-ETO expression. Its depletion causes extensive changes in transcription factor binding, as well as gene expression, and initiates myeloid differentiation. However, how these processes are connected within a gene regulatory network is unclear. To address this question, we performed Promoter-Capture Hi-C assays, with or without RUNX1-ETO depletion and assigned interacting cis-regulatory elements to their respective genes. To construct a RUNX1-ETO-dependent gene regulatory network maintaining AML, we integrated cis-regulatory element interactions with gene expression and transcription factor binding data. This analysis shows that RUNX1-ETO participates in cis-regulatory element interactions. However, differential interactions following RUNX1-ETO depletion are driven by alterations in the binding of RUNX1-ETO-regulated transcription factors.","['Ptasinska, Anetta', 'Pickin, Anna', 'Assi, Salam A', 'Chin, Paulynn Suyin', 'Ames, Luke', 'Avellino, Roberto', 'Groschel, Stefan', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Cockerill, Peter N', 'Osborne, Cameron S', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Ptasinska A', 'Pickin A', 'Assi SA', 'Chin PS', 'Ames L', 'Avellino R', 'Groschel S', 'Delwel R', 'Cockerill PN', 'Osborne CS', 'Bonifer C']",,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Oncode Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', ""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.

High levels of body fat (adiposity) and obesity are associated with endocrine and hormonal dysregulation, cardiovascular compromise, hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis, changes in drug metabolism and clearance, inflammation, and metabolic stress. It is thus unsurprising that obesity can affect the development of and survival from a wide variety of malignancies.

Few parent-specific psychosocial interventions have been evaluated in randomized trials. Objective: To determine if individual- or group-based delivery of a novel intervention called Promoting Resilience in Stress Management for Parents (PRISM-P) improves parent-reported resilience compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel, phase 2 randomized clinical trial with enrollment from December 2016 through December 2018 and 3-month follow-up was conducted at Seattle Children's Hospital. English-speaking parents or guardians of children who were 2 to 24 years old, who had received a diagnosis of a new malignant neoplasm 1 to 10 weeks prior to enrollment, and who were receiving cancer-directed therapy at Seattle Children's Hospital were included. Parents were randomized 1:1:1 to the one-on-one or group PRISM-P intervention or to usual care. Data were analyzed in 2019 (primary analyses from January to March 2019; final analyses in July 2019). Interventions: The PRISM-P is a manualized, brief intervention targeting 4 skills: stress management, goal setting, cognitive reframing, and meaning making. For one-on-one delivery, skills were taught privately and in person for 30 to 60 minutes approximately every other week. For group delivery, the same skills were taught in a single session with at least 2 parents present. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants completed patient-reported outcome surveys at enrollment and at 3 months. Linear regression modeling evaluated associations in the intention-to-treat population between each delivery format and the primary outcome (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale scores, ranging from 0 to 40, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience) and secondary outcomes (benefit finding, social support, health-related quality of life, stress, and distress) at 3 months. Results: In total, 94 parents enrolled, were randomized to 1 of the 3 groups, and completed baseline surveys (32 parents in one-on-one sessions, 32 in group sessions, and 30 in usual care). Their median (interquartile range) ages were 35 to 38 (31-44) years across the 3 groups, and they were predominantly white, college-educated mothers. Their children had median (interquartile range) ages of 5 to 8 (3-14) years; slightly more than half of the children were boys, and the most common cancer type was leukemia or lymphoma. One-on-one PRISM-P delivery was significantly associated with improvement compared with usual care in parent-reported outcomes for resilience (beta, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.1-4.6; P = .04) and for benefit finding (beta, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; P = .001). No significant associations were detected between either platform and other parent-reported outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: When delivered individually, PRISM-P was associated with improved parent-reported resilience and benefit finding. This scalable psychosocial intervention may help parents cope and find meaning after their child receives a diagnosis of a serious illness.

The use of quantitative chimerism methods aims to assess the kinetics of engraftment to determine graft rejection and failure or relapse of the underlying disease after AHSCT. An accurate and sensitive determination of chimerism status is mandatory after AHSCT. This study aimed to compare two chimerism methods: Multiplex Short Tandem Repeat-Polymerase Chain Reaction (STR-PCR) and quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR). METHODS: Thirty-nine blood samples at +28 day were used to extract DNA. Most patients had been diagnosed with acute leukemia (74.3 %) and other hematological diseases. For Multiplex STR-PCR method, PCR products were separated on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, USA) and for qRT-PCR, an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystem, USA) Plate System Real Time Analyzer was used to determine the quantification of chimerism per-centage. RESULTS: Of the 39 analyzed samples, 82% concordant chimerism results were detected for both STR-PCR and qRT-PCR methods. Ten mixed chimerisms (MC) were found by qRT-PCR whereas of only 3 MC cases were detected by STR-PCR. In the discordant group of 7 by qRT-PCR, we observed Acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD). Three MC cases that were detected by both STR- and qRT-PCR methods died because of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative chimerism method along with multiplex STR-PCR method is important for early detection of MC. qRT-PCR methods can be valuable options in the prevention of graft failure and assisting with fast and early treatment strategies for patients undergoing AHSCT.","['Abatay-Sel, Figen', 'Savran-Oguz, Fatma', 'Kalayoglu-Besisik, Sevgi', 'Mastanzade, Metban', 'Duvarci-Ogret, Yeliz', 'Yonal-Hindilerden, Ipek', 'Aydin, Filiz']","['Abatay-Sel F', 'Savran-Oguz F', 'Kalayoglu-Besisik S', 'Mastanzade M', 'Duvarci-Ogret Y', 'Yonal-Hindilerden I', 'Aydin F']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190221 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2019 Sep 1;65(9). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190221.,20200210,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chimerism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transplantation Chimera/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated associations between pretherapeutic BMI, cytogenetic abnormalities, and outcome in a large multinational cohort of children with AML. METHODS: We included patients, age 2-17 years, diagnosed with de novo AML from the five Nordic countries (2004-2016), Hong Kong (2007-2016), the Netherlands and Belgium (2010-2016), and Canada and USA (1995-2012). BMI standard deviations score for age and sex was calculated and categorized according to the World Health Organization. Cumulative incidence functions, Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used to investigate associations. RESULTS: In total, 867 patients were included. The median age was 10 years (range 2-17 years). At diagnosis, 32 (4%) were underweight, 632 (73%) were healthy weight, 127 (15%) were overweight, and 76 (9%) were obese. There was no difference in relapse risk, treatment-related mortality or overall mortality across BMI groups. The frequency of t(8;21) and inv(16) increased with increasing BMI. For obese patients, the sex, age, and country adjusted odds ratio of having t(8;21) or inv(16) were 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-3.4) and 2.8 (95% CI 1.3-5.8), respectively, compared to healthy weight patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm previous reports of associations between overweight and increased treatment-related or overall mortality in children. Obesity was associated with a higher frequency of t(8;21) and inv(16). AML cytogenetics appear to differ by BMI status.","['Lohmann, Ditte J A', 'Asdahl, Peter H', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Koskenvuo, Minna', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Lohmann DJA', 'Asdahl PH', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Ha SY', 'Jonsson OG', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Koskenvuo M', 'Lausen B', 'De Moerloose B', 'Palle J', 'Zeller B', 'Sung L', 'Hasle H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9935-9157', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0951-3091']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N, Denmark.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Queen Mary Hospital and Hong Kong Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Study Group (HKPHOSG), Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', ""Department of Woman's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Danish Childhood Cancer Foundation/International', 'Danish Cancer Society/International', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation/International', 'CIHR/Canada', 'Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute/International', 'CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190918,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6825997,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*body mass index', '*cytogenetic aberrations', '*mortality', '*pediatrics', '*recurrence']",2019/09/19 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2554 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Nov;8(15):6634-6643. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2554.

The effects of all-oral direct-acting antiviral therapy (DAA) on both the HCV infection as well as the state of cancer remission have not been well investigated in this population. AIM: To test the effects of dual sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) therapy in the treatment of chronic HCV in survivors of hematologic malignancy in pediatric age group. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label multicenter study. A total of 20 eligible, chronic HCV, genotype-4, infected children who had been in continuous complete remission from hematologic cancer (leukemia/lymphoma) for at least one year were included in the study. All patients were treated with combined SOF/DCV for 12 wk. Patients were monitored throughout the study till 12 wk after end of treatment for safety and efficacy outcomes including the sustained virologic response 12 (SVR12) rate, hematological indices, liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat SVR12 rate was 20 of 20 (100%; 95%CI: 84%-100%). All patients showed normalized liver enzymes from week-4. All hematological indices, liver and kidney functions were kept normal throughout the study. No fatalities or treatment-emergent serious or severe adverse events were reported throughout the study. CONCLUSION: SOF/DCV combined therapy could be used safely and effectively in the treatment of chronic HCV genotype-4 infection in leukemia/lymphoma treated children. No relapses were detected during treatment and throughout the follow up period for either the original malignant disease or the HCV infection.","['El-Shabrawi, Mortada Hf', 'Sherief, Laila M', 'Yakoot, Mostafa', 'Kamal, Naglaa M', 'Almalky, Mohamed A', 'AbdElgawad, Manal M', 'Mahfouz, Aml A', 'Helmy, Sherine', 'Kamal, Enas M', 'Attia, Dina', 'El-Khayat, Hisham R']","['El-Shabrawi MH', 'Sherief LM', 'Yakoot M', 'Kamal NM', 'Almalky MA', 'AbdElgawad MM', 'Mahfouz AA', 'Helmy S', 'Kamal EM', 'Attia D', 'El-Khayat HR']",,"['Paediatric Hepatology Department, Cairo Faculty of Medicine, Cairo 11559, Egypt.', 'Paediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Zagazig Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig 21121, Egypt.', 'Internal medicine, Pediatrics and Hepatology, Green Clinic and Research Center, Alexandria University, Alexandria 21121, Egypt. yakoot@yahoo.com.', 'Paediatric Hepatology Department, Cairo Faculty of Medicine, Cairo 11559, Egypt.', 'Paediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Zagazig Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig 21121, Egypt.', 'Paediatric Hepatology Department, Alexandria Faculty of medicine, Alexandria 21121, Egypt.', 'Paediatric Hepatology Department, Alexandria Faculty of medicine, Alexandria 21121, Egypt.', 'Innovations & Research, Pharco Corporation, Alexandria 21121, Egypt.', 'Endemic medicine and Hepatology Department, Minia University, Minia 22233, Egypt.', 'Endemic medicine and Hepatology Department, Beni-suef University, Beni-suef 62511, Egypt.', 'Gastroenterology and Endemic Medicine Department, Theodore Research Institute, Cairo 23323, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,PMC6718790,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic hepatitis C', 'Daclatasvir', 'Efficacy', 'Sofosbuvir', 'Survivors of childhood cancer']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v7.i16.2247 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2019 Aug 26;7(16):2247-2255. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v7.i16.2247.,,2247-2255,,,,,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: Mostafa Yakoot had conducted clinical trials on', 'Pharco products.

Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of which thrombocytopenia is a recurrent presenting feature. A case of pancytopenia presenting in pregnancy is described in which the thrombocytopenia persisted postpartum coincidental with a vesicular, pustular rash characterised as Sweet's syndrome. Hematological, histological, immunophenotypic, and molecular investigations confirmed the presence of HCL. The patient was treated with cladribine resulting in resolution of Sweet's syndrome, hematological remission from HCL, and achievement of a normal platelet count. This case highlights the need to maintain a wide differential diagnosis for presentations of pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia in pregnancy and the requirement for follow-up investigation of unusual cases with a lack of response to steroids or immunoglobulin.","['Shackleton, Louisa', 'Langabeer, Stephen E', ""O'Brien, David"", 'McCarron, Sarah L', 'Byrne, Bridgette', 'Barry, Rupert', 'Flavin, Richard', 'Bacon, C Larry', 'Flynn, Catherine M']","['Shackleton L', 'Langabeer SE', ""O'Brien D"", 'McCarron SL', 'Byrne B', 'Barry R', 'Flavin R', 'Bacon CL', 'Flynn CM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6119-158X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0588-7427']","[""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", 'Maternal Medicine Service, Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland.', ""Department of Dermatology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Histopathology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20190821,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,PMC6721453,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3238168 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Aug 21;2019:3238168. doi: 10.1155/2019/3238168. eCollection 2019.,,3238168,,,,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, expression levels of ATG7 and LC3 as two key genes in AML patients are targeted in this study. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was performed on 55 de novo AML patients against 17 healthy volunteers, acquired samples from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) sources in different ages and gender. The evaluation was executed by mRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR and data was analyzed by SPSS. RESULTS: Analyzed data indicate a significant decrease between expression of ATG7 and LC3 in AML patients against control (Pv < 0.05). Decrease in both genes expression was detected in most of the patients, 81.81% and 75.55%, respectively. Also LC3 overexpression was detected in 11.33% of AML patients. Moreover, a positive significant correlation between ATG7 and LC3 genes was detected (r = 0.481; Pv = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that significant reduction of autophagy genes in de novo AML patients is important to overcome this system and initiate leukomogenesis. It seems a new insight is required for new achievements in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and monitoring AML patients.","['Mohamadimaram, Mohamadreza', 'Allahbakhshian Farsani, Mehdi', 'Mirzaeian, Amin', 'Shahsavan, Shaghayegh', 'Hajifathali, Abbass', 'Parkhihdeh, Sayeh', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Hossein']","['Mohamadimaram M', 'Allahbakhshian Farsani M', 'Mirzaeian A', 'Shahsavan S', 'Hajifathali A', 'Parkhihdeh S', 'Mohammadi MH']",,"['Laboratory Hematology and blood Banking Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Laboratory Hematology and blood Banking Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Laboratory Hematology and blood Banking Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Pharm Res,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,101208407,PMC6706741,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'ATG7', 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Autophagy', 'LC3']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22037/ijpr.2019.1100682 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Pharm Res. 2019 Spring;18(2):1060-1066. doi: 10.22037/ijpr.2019.1100682.,,1060-1066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The additive hazards model estimates the difference in hazards and has an intuitive biological interpretation. The proposed weighted estimators for the additive hazards model use incomplete data nonparametrically and have close-form expressions. We show that they are consistent and asymptotically normal, and are more efficient than the simple weighted estimator which only uses the complete data. We illustrate their finite-sample performance through simulation studies and an application to study the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative as well as an application to the mouse leukemia study.","['Qi, Lihong', 'Zhang, Xu', 'Sun, Yanqing', 'Wang, Lu', 'Zhao, Yichuan']","['Qi L', 'Zhang X', 'Sun Y', 'Wang L', 'Zhao Y']",,"['Division of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of California Davis.

Stromal signatures have been correlated to survival in DLBCL. Their use, however, is hampered by the lack of assays for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material (FFPE). We constructed a lymphoma-associated macrophage interaction signature (LAMIS) interrogating features of the microenvironment using a NanoString assay applicable to FFPE. The clinical impact of the signature could be validated in a cohort of 466 patients enrolled in prospective clinical trials of the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (DSHNHL). Patients with high expression of the signature (LAMIS(high)) had shorter EFS, PFS, and OS. Multivariate analyses revealed independence from IPI factors in EFS (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4, p-value = 0.001), PFS (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.5, p-value = 0.001) and OS (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.7, p-value = 0.001). Multivariate analyses adjusted for the IPI factors showed the signature to be independent from COO, MYC rearrangements and double expresser status (DE). LAMIS(high) and simultaneous DE status characterized a patient subgroup with dismal prognosis and early relapse. Our data underline the importance of the microenvironment in prognosis. Combined analysis of stromal features, the IPI and DE may provide a new rationale for targeted therapy.","['Staiger, Annette M', 'Altenbuchinger, Michael', 'Ziepert, Marita', 'Kohler, Christian', 'Horn, Heike', 'Huttner, Michael', 'Huttl, Katrin S', 'Glehr, Gunther', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Szczepanowski, Monika', 'Richter, Julia', 'Stein, Harald', 'Feller, Alfred C', 'Moller, Peter', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Poeschel, Viola', 'Held, Gerhard', 'Loeffler, Markus', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Trumper, Lorenz', 'Pukrop, Tobias', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Ott, German', 'Spang, Rainer']","['Staiger AM', 'Altenbuchinger M', 'Ziepert M', 'Kohler C', 'Horn H', 'Huttner M', 'Huttl KS', 'Glehr G', 'Klapper W', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Richter J', 'Stein H', 'Feller AC', 'Moller P', 'Hansmann ML', 'Poeschel V', 'Held G', 'Loeffler M', 'Schmitz N', 'Trumper L', 'Pukrop T', 'Rosenwald A', 'Ott G', 'Spang R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5896-3200', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7208-4117', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9543-4084']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Statistical Bioinformatics, Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Statistical Bioinformatics, Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Statistical Bioinformatics, Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Statistical Bioinformatics, Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Hematology Laboratory, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Pathodiagnostik Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Haematopathologie Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'DSHNHL Studiensekretariat, Universitatsklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany.', 'DSHNHL Studiensekretariat, Universitatsklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August Universitat, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Universitatsklinikum Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitat Wurzburg and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCCMF), Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.

Aurora A depletion primarily leads to mitotic spindle formation defects and consequently prometaphase arrest, whereas Aurora B/C inactivation primarily induces polyploidy from cytokinesis failure. Aurora B/C inactivation phenotypes are also epistatic to those of Aurora A, such that the concomitant inactivation of Aurora A and B, or all Aurora isoforms by nonisoform-selective Aurora inhibitors, demonstrates the Aurora B/C-dominant cytokinesis failure and polyploidy phenotypes. Several Aurora inhibitors are in clinical trials for T/B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, lung, and breast cancers. Here, we describe an Aurora A-selective inhibitor, LY3295668, which potently inhibits Aurora autophosphorylation and its kinase activity in vitro and in vivo, persistently arrests cancer cells in mitosis, and induces more profound apoptosis than Aurora B or Aurora A/B dual inhibitors without Aurora B inhibition-associated cytokinesis failure and aneuploidy. LY3295668 inhibits the growth of a broad panel of cancer cell lines, including small-cell lung and breast cancer cells. It demonstrates significant efficacy in small-cell lung cancer xenograft and patient-derived tumor preclinical models as a single agent and in combination with standard-of-care agents. LY3295668, as a highly Aurora A-selective inhibitor, may represent a preferred approach to the current pan-Aurora inhibitors as a cancer therapeutic agent.","['Du, Jian', 'Yan, Lei', 'Torres, Raquel',

We aimed to examine incidentally diagnosed cancer among a cohort of cancer patients diagnosed in England. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of national primary care audit data on an incident cancer patient population. SETTING: We analysed free-text information on the presenting features of cancer patients aged 15 or older included in the English National Audit of Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care (2009-2010). Patients with screen-detected cancers or prostate cancer were excluded. We examined the odds of incidental cancer diagnosis by patient characteristics and cancer site using logistic regression, and described clinical scenarios leading to incidental diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the studied cancer patient population (n=13 810), 520 (4%) patients were diagnosed incidentally. The odds of incidental cancer diagnosis increased with age (p<0.001), with no difference between men and women after adjustment. Incidental diagnosis was most common among patients with leukaemia (23%), renal (13%) and thyroid cancer (12%), and least common among patients with brain (0.9%), oesophageal (0.5%) and cervical cancer (no cases diagnosed incidentally). Variation in odds of incidental diagnosis by cancer site remained after adjusting for age group and sex.There was a range of clinical scenarios preceding incidental diagnoses in primary or secondary care. These included the monitoring or management of pre-existing conditions, routine testing before or after elective surgery, and the investigation of unrelated acute or new conditions. CONCLUSIONS: One in 25 patients with cancer in our population-based cohort were diagnosed incidentally, through different mechanisms across primary and secondary care settings. The epidemiological, clinical, psychological and economic implications of this phenomenon merit further investigation.","['Koo, Minjoung Monica', 'Rubin, Greg', 'McPhail, Sean', 'Lyratzopoulos, Georgios']","['Koo MM', 'Rubin G', 'McPhail S', 'Lyratzopoulos G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9832-9872', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2873-7421']","['Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare & Outcomes (ECHO) Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College of London, London, UK monica.koo@ucl.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare & Outcomes (ECHO) Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College of London, London, UK.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England, London, UK.', 'Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare & Outcomes (ECHO) Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College of London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['C18081/A18180/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C8640/A23385/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190917,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,PMC6756358,['NOTNLM'],"['*health services administration & management', '*oncology', '*pathology', '*primary care', '*public health', '*radiology & imaging']",2019/09/19 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2018-028362 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028362 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2019 Sep 17;9(9):e028362. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028362.,20200930,e028362,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Relapse rates are still significant, and prognosis is particularly bleak for relapsed patients. Therefore, development of novel therapies specifically targeting pathways controlling leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) activity is mandatory for fighting refractory T-ALL. The interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) is a crucial T-cell developmental pathway that is commonly expressed in T-ALL and has been implicated in leukemia progression; however, the significance of IL-7R/IL-7 signaling in T-ALL pathogenesis and its contribution to disease relapse remain unknown. To directly explore whether IL-7R targeting may be therapeutically efficient against T-ALL relapse, we focused on a known Notch1-induced T-ALL model, because a majority of T-ALL patients harbor activating mutations in NOTCH1, which is a transcriptional regulator of IL-7R expression. Using loss-of-function approaches, we show that Il7r-deficient, but not wild-type, mouse hematopoietic progenitors transduced with constitutively active Notch1 failed to generate leukemia upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, thus providing formal evidence that IL-7R function is essential for Notch1-induced T-cell leukemogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that IL-7R expression is an early functional biomarker of T-ALL cells with LIC potential and report that impaired IL-7R signaling hampers engraftment and progression of patient-derived T-ALL xenografts. Notably, we show that IL-7R-dependent LIC activity and leukemia progression can be extended to human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). These results have important therapeutic implications, highlighting the relevance that targeting normal IL-7R signaling may have in future therapeutic interventions, particularly for preventing T-ALL (and B-ALL) relapse.","['Gonzalez-Garcia, Sara', 'Mosquera, Marta', 'Fuentes, Patricia', 'Palumbo, Tiziana', 'Escudero, Adela', 'Perez-Martinez, Antonio', 'Ramirez, Manuel', 'Corcoran, Anne E', 'Toribio, Maria L']","['Gonzalez-Garcia S', 'Mosquera M', 'Fuentes P', 'Palumbo T', 'Escudero A', 'Perez-Martinez A', 'Ramirez M', 'Corcoran AE', 'Toribio ML']",,"['Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Pediatric Oncology, Hematopoietic Transplantation and Cell Therapy, Instituto de Genetica Medica y Molecular del Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Hospital Universitario La Paz (INGEMM-IdiPAZ), Madrid, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Pediatric Oncology, Hematopoietic Transplantation and Cell Therapy, Instituto de Genetica Medica y Molecular del Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Hospital Universitario La Paz (INGEMM-IdiPAZ), Madrid, Spain.', 'Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Service, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UAM, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus, UAM, Spain and.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme and Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6933515,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)73148-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000982 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Dec 12;134(24):2171-2182. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000982.,20200330,2171-2182,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although therapeutic agents have improved treatment options for CLL, many patients still fail to respond. Some patients also show immunosuppression. We have investigated trabectedin, a marine-derived compound with cytotoxic activity on macrophages in solid tumors. Here, we demonstrate that trabectedin induces apoptosis of human primary leukemic cells and also selected myeloid and lymphoid immunosuppressive cells, mainly through the TRAIL/TNF pathway. Trabectedin modulates transcription and translation of IL6, CCL2, and IFNalpha in myeloid cells and FOXP3 in regulatory T cells. Human memory CD8(+) T cells downregulate PD-1 and, along with monocytes, exert in vivo antitumor function. In xenograft and immunocompetent CLL mouse models, trabectedin has antileukemic effects and antitumor impact on the myeloid and lymphoid cells compartment. It depletes myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages and increases memory T cells. Trabectedin also blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 axis by targeting PD-L1(+) CLL cells, PD-L1(+) monocytes/macrophages, and PD-1(+) T cells. Thus, trabectedin behaves as an immunomodulatory drug with potentially attractive therapeutic value in the subversion of the protumor microenvironment and in overcoming chemoimmune resistance.","['Banerjee, Priyanka', 'Zhang, Ronghua', 'Ivan, Cristina', 'Galletti, Giovanni', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Barbaglio, Federica', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Aracil, Miguel', 'Klein, Christian', 'Wierda, William', 'Plunkett, William', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa S']","['Banerjee P', 'Zhang R', 'Ivan C', 'Galletti G', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Barbaglio F', 'Scarfo L', 'Aracil M', 'Klein C', 'Wierda W', 'Plunkett W', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Gandhi V', 'Keating MJ', 'Bertilaccio MTS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4848-0168', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6613-2354', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7594-7280', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9311-2164']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'B-cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'B-cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'R&D, PharmaMar, Madrid, Spain.', 'Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Oncology Discovery, Roche Innovation Center Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

However, approximately 60% of patients relapse after the discontinuation of TKIs. Relapse after discontinuation is likely due the inability of TKIs to eradicate CML stem cells (CML-LSCs). In our previous study, 12 out of 22 patients maintained a stable DMR after TKI withdrawal, and we found that fewer patients who were treated with second-generation TKI relapsed compared with those receiving imatinib. Therefore, we hypothesized that second-generation TKIs and imatinib may have different effects on CML-LSCs, which may affect the clinical outcome after TKI discontinuation. To investigate this, we established a TKI discontinuation model in vitro by treating CML CD34(+) cells with imatinib and dasatinib continuously for 72 h and then removing the TKI for 24 h. Colony-forming cell (CFC) assays, apoptosis assessment, and proteomic analysis were then performed. We found that TKI discontinuation resulted in less proliferation and CFC output in dasatinib-treated cells compared with imatinib. However, the dasatinib-treated group exhibited increased apoptosis. In the proteomics analysis, we identified 160 upregulated and 151 downregulated proteins when the two TKI discontinuation groups were compared. Importantly, proteins involved in NAD(+) nucleosidase activity, mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton transport, and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly expressed, which were mainly involved in metabolic processes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that imatinib and dasatinib have clear differential effects on CML-LSCs through the regulation of mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation, which may provide a new target for eliminating CML-LSCs in the context of TKI discontinuation.","['Jiang, Lin', 'Wang, Hongxiang', 'Zhu, Xiaoying', 'Liu, Wen', 'Zhou, Shu', 'Geng, Zhe', 'Xiao, Yi', 'Zou, Ping', 'You, Yong', 'Li, Qing', 'Zhu, Xiaojian']","['Jiang L', 'Wang H', 'Zhu X', 'Liu W', 'Zhou S', 'Geng Z', 'Xiao Y', 'Zou P', 'You Y', 'Li Q', 'Zhu X']",,"['Department of Hematology, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No.1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191022,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*discontinuation', '*leukemia stem cell', '*mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2019/09/19 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2019.0117 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2019 Nov 15;28(22):1480-1485. doi: 10.1089/scd.2019.0117.

These studies demonstrated that TLR9 agonists induce an immediate NK response followed by adaptive T and B cells responses resulting in long term anti-leukemia immunity. Methods: The Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma Phase I consortium performed a pilot study on 3 patients with MRD positive acute leukemia after an initial remission on conventional chemotherapy (TACL T2009-008) with the TLR 9 agonist (GNKG168). To guide future trial development, we evaluated the impact of GNKG168 by Nanostring on the expression 608 genes before and 8 days after initiation of GNKG168 therapy. Results: Twenty-three out of 578 markers on the nanostring panel showed significant difference (p </= 0.05). We focused on 8 markers that had the greatest differences with p < 0.01. Two genes were increased, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and H-RAS, and 6 were decreased, Single Ig and TIR Domain containing (SIGIRR, IL1R8), interleukin 1 receptor 1 (IL1RL1, ST2), C-C Motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8), interleukin 7 R (IL7R), cluster of differentiation 8B (CD8B), and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3D). Tumor inhibitory pathways were downregulated including the SIGIRR (IL1R8), important in IL-37 signaling and NK cell inhibition. TLR9 can induce IL-33, which is known to downregulate ST2 (IL1RL1) a receptor for IL-33. Conclusion: GNKG168 therapy is associated with immunologic changes in pediatric leukemia patients. Further work with a larger sample size is required to assess the impact of these changes on disease treatment and persistence of leukemia remission.","['Ronsley, Rebecca', 'Kariminia, Amina', 'Ng, Bernard', 'Mostafavi, Sara', 'Reid, Gregor', 'Subrt, Peter', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Schultz, Kirk R']","['Ronsley R', 'Kariminia A', 'Ng B', 'Mostafavi S', 'Reid G', 'Subrt P', 'Hijiya N', 'Schultz KR']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, USA.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Statistics and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Statistics and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, USA.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, USA.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada."", ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IIllinois, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, USA.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20190918,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'bone marrow transplant GNKG168', 'children']",2019/09/19 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1667461 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Nov;36(8):468-481. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1667461.

The clinical data of 77 patients enrolled from January 2005 to June 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. The hematologic complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were evaluated between standard-risk (SR) and high-risk (HR) groups. Prognostic factors and complications were investigated in these two groups. CR in the SR and HR groups was 96.4% (54/56) and 85.7% (18/21), respectively, while the 10-year OS was 94.6% (53/56) and 76.2% (16/21), respectively. The cumulative incidence of early death was 6.5% (5/77), and the SR and HR groups were 1.8% (1/56) and 19.0% (4/21), respectively. Only two patients relapsed, and the relapse rate was 2.6% (2/77). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the SR group had a significantly better long-term survival than HR counterparts (p= .016). Initial leukocyte count was the only prognostic factor (p= .016) by univariate analysis, while other factors, such as FLT3-ITD and platelet count, had no correlation with prognosis. In addition, early deaths were mainly due to intracranial hemorrhage. Although the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy can improve the outcome of APL patients, the early deaths and anthracycline-related cardiac toxicity were relatively higher in our study. Current efforts focus on reducing or even avoiding chemotherapy in APL children and rest on the frontline regimen of intravenous arsenic trioxide or oral realgar-indigo naturalis formula plus ATRA,

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total sample size of 220 children with 110 children with Leukemia of subtype acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing treatment and 110 healthy children in the age group of 3-14 years was selected. Evaluation of caries status using dmft/DMFT indices, oral hygiene status using OHI-S and plaque index by Sillness and Loe, gingival health status using modified gingival index, oral mucositis as per WHO oral toxicity scale, xerostomia as per common terminology criteria for adverse events for dry mouth, and salivary pH using pH paper strips was done. Results revealed a lower prevalence of dental caries, good oral hygiene and mild gingivitis in children with ALL when compared to healthy children. Oral mucositis was found to occur only in children with ALL and a reduced salivary flow rate and reduced salivary pH were seen in these children when compared to healthy children. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that children with ALL undergoing treatment and following an oral care protocol presented with a good Oral Health Status when compared with healthy children.","['Kapoor, Gauri', 'Goswami, Mridula', 'Sharma, Sadhna', 'Mehta, Anurag', 'Dhillon, Jatinder Kaur']","['Kapoor G', 'Goswami M', 'Sharma S', 'Mehta A', 'Dhillon JK']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7729-9819'],"['Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory & Transfusion Services, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory & Transfusion Services, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190917,United States,Spec Care Dentist,"Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",8103755,,['NOTNLM'],"['leukemia', 'oral care protocol', 'oral health status']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/11/27 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/scd.12419 [doi]'],ppublish,Spec Care Dentist. 2019 Nov;39(6):564-571. doi: 10.1111/scd.12419.

The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of AML defined two AEL subtypes: erythroleukaemia (EL), in which erythroid precursors account for 50% or more of all nucleated bone marrow cells and myeloblasts account for 20% or more of the nonerythroid cell population; and pure erythroid leukemia (PEL), in which erythroid precursors account for 80% or more of all nucleated bone marrow cells. We report the case of an elderly female patient with wasting syndrome and pancytopenia without evidence of blasts in peripheral blood. A diagnosis of PEL was established on the basis of bone marrow biopsy findings. The patient died on postadmission day 20, and an autopsy was performed. We reclassified the disease as EL on the basis of the autopsy findings, which included myeloblasts accounting for more than 20% of the nonerythroid cells in the bone marrow, as well as leukemic infiltration and myeloid metaplasia in solid organs, such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and abdominal lymph nodes. A rare disease, AEL accounts for less than 5% of all AMLs and is practically a diagnosis of exclusion. Autopsy reports of AEL are extremely rare in the literature. We demonstrate that in the case reported here, leukemia cells tended to infiltrate solid organs with myeloid metaplasia.

The FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutations are biomarkers for high risk AML and are associated with drug resistance and high risk of relapse. Multiple FLT3 inhibitors are in clinical development, including lestaurtinib, tandutinib, quizartinib, midostaurin, gilteritinib, and crenolanib. Midostaurin and gilteritinib have been approved by FDA for Flt3 mutated AML. Gilteritinib (ASP2215, Xospata) is a small molecule dual inhibitor of FLT3/AXL. The ADMIRAL study showed that longer overall survival and higher response rate are associated with gilteritinib in comparison with salvage chemotherapy for relapse /refractory (R/R) AML. These data from the ADMIRAL study may lead to the therapy paradigm shift and establish gilteritinib as the new standard therapy for R/R FLT3-mutated AML. Currently, multiple clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the combination of gilteritinib with other agents and regimens. This study summarized clinical trials of gilteritinib for AML.","['Zhao, Juanjuan', 'Song, Yongping', 'Liu, Delong']","['Zhao J', 'Song Y', 'Liu D']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4502-4949'],"['1Department of Oncology, The first Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', '1Department of Oncology, The first Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', '1Department of Oncology, The first Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', '2Division of Hematology & Oncology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.0000 0001 0728 151Xgrid.260917.b']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190911,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,PMC6737601,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'Gilteritinib', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-019-0170-2 [doi]', '170 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2019 Sep 11;7:19. doi: 10.1186/s40364-019-0170-2. eCollection 2019.,,19,,,,,"['DL serves on the Xospata speaker bureau of Astellas.

We investigated HBV immunity before and after chemotherapy and assessed immune response to re-vaccination after chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of children and adolescents aged <19 years requested for vaccination after chemotherapy for acute leukemia to evaluate hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) status before and after chemotherapy and to identify factors related to HBsAb positivity after chemotherapy. Results: Of 89 enrolled patients, 61 (68.5%) with acute leukemia were HBsAb positive before chemotherapy. Of these 61 patients, 48 (78.7%) seroconverted to HBsAb negative status after chemotherapy; there were 76 (85.4%) HBsAb negative patients after chemotherapy. HBsAb positive patients when compared to HBsAb negative patients after chemotherapy had a significantly higher HBsAb positive rate (100.0% vs. 63.2%, p=0.008) before chemotherapy. Following HBsAb testing after one dose of the HBV vaccination, 33 (43.4%) of the 76 HBsAb negative patients seroconverted to an HBsAb positive status. HBsAb positive patients after a single dose of HBV vaccination had a significantly higher HBsAb positive rate at the time of diagnosis compared to HBsAb negative patients (84.8% vs. 48.8%, p=0.001). Conclusions: Based on these results, HBV re-vaccination after chemotherapy is recommended for all children and adolescents with acute leukemia.

The RPKM values of the RNAseq data were subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in modularization. Results: We identified survival specific lncRNAs and mRNAs, which were divided into modules by coexpression analysis. The lncRNAs were mainly annotated into ""Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis"". The hub lncRNA and co-expressed mRNAs were further selected for analysis of risk stratification. LncRNA-LOC646762 may contribute to AML through the ""endocytosis"" signaling pathway. Finally, the expression levels of LOC646762 and co-expressed CCND3, CBR1, C10orf54, CD97 and BLOC1S1 in the adult AML patients and healthy volunteers were validated by qRT-PCR, and then their roles in prognosis and risk stratification were identified. Conclusions: Prognostic lncRNA-LOC646762, which may contribute to AML through the ""endocytosis"" signaling pathway, may act as a biomarker for predicting the survival of adult AML patients, as well as for risk stratification.","['Chen, Cun-Te', 'Wang, Pei-Pei', 'Mo, Wen-Jian', 'Zhang, Yu-Ping', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Deng, Ting-Fen', 'Zhou, Ming', 'Chen, Xiao-Wei', 'Wang, Shun-Qing', 'Wang, Cai-Xia']","['Chen CT', 'Wang PP', 'Mo WJ', 'Zhang YP', 'Zhou W', 'Deng TF', 'Zhou M', 'Chen XW', 'Wang SQ', 'Wang CX']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190819,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,PMC6746144,['NOTNLM'],"['WGCNA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'lncRNA', 'prognosis', 'risk stratification']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.31234 [doi]', 'jcav10p4707 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2019 Aug 19;10(19):4707-4718. doi: 10.7150/jca.31234. eCollection 2019.,,4707-4718,,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The disease causes a decrease in hematopoiesis, so children often present with symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Symptoms for this malignancy may have significant overlap with other conditions such as osteomyelitis. Case Report: A 2-year-old male with no significant medical history presented with lower extremity pain and fever. Initial investigations, including imaging and complete blood count, led physicians to diagnose bilateral osteomyelitis. The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics; however, his symptoms returned. Eventually, a bone marrow aspiration showed CD99 membrane-positive small round blue cell tumors. The patient was diagnosed with ALL. He was successfully treated with chemotherapy and is now in remission. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of a broad differential diagnosis for a child presenting with leg pain and fever.","['Desmond, Lesley N', 'Fletcher, Matthew B', 'Warrier, Rajasekharan P']","['Desmond LN', 'Fletcher MB', 'Warrier RP']",,"['The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA.', 'The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,United States,Ochsner J,The Ochsner journal,101125795,PMC6735594,['NOTNLM'],"['Anemia', 'bone marrow', 'chemotherapy', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'fever', 'leukocyte counts', 'leukopenia', 'osteomyelitis', 'precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma', 'thrombocytopenia']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.31486/toj.18.0122 [doi]', 'toj.18.0122 [pii]']",ppublish,Ochsner J. 2019 Fall;19(3):260-263. doi: 10.31486/toj.18.0122.,,260-263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Folinic acid rescue therapy (Leucovorin) is administered after MTX to reduce toxicity. Previous studies hypothesized that Leucovorin could 'rescue' both normal healthy cells and leukemic blasts from cell death. We assessed whether Leucovorin is able to restore red blood cell folate levels after MTX. METHODS: We prospectively determined erythrocyte folate levels (5-methyltetrahydrofolate (THF) and non-methyl THF) and serum folate levels in 67 children with ALL before start (T0) and after stop (T1) of HD-MTX and Leucovorin courses. RESULTS: Erythrocyte folate levels increased between T0 and T1 (mean +/- SD: 416.7 +/- 145.5 nmol/L and 641.2 +/- 196.3 nmol/L respectively, p<0.001). This was due to an increase in 5-methyl THF levels (mean increase: 217.7 +/- 209.5 nmol/L, p<0.001), whereas non-methyl THF levels did not change (median increase: 0.6 nmol/L [-9.9-11.1], p = 0.676). Serum folate levels increased between T0 and T1 (median increase: 29.2 nmol/L [32.9-74.0], p<0.001). Results were not significantly affected by age, sex, ALL immunophenotype and MTHFR c.677C>T genotype. CONCLUSION: Intracellular folate levels accumulate after HD-MTX and Leucovorin therapy in children with ALL, suggesting that Leucovorin restores the intracellular folate pool. Future studies are necessary to assess concomitant lower uptake of MTX.","['Oosterom, Natanja', 'de Jonge, Robert', 'Smith, Desiree E C', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Fiocco, Marta', 'van Zelst, Bertrand D', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Heil, Sandra G']","['Oosterom N', 'de Jonge R', 'Smith DEC', 'Pieters R', 'Tissing WJE', 'Fiocco M', 'van Zelst BD', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Heil SG']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9871-1887'],"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'VU Medical Center, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Academic Medical Center, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'VU Medical Center, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Groningen, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Mathematical Institute, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190917,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6748431,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0221591 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-10004 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Sep 17;14(9):e0221591. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221591. eCollection 2019.,20200316,e0221591,,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antidotes/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*blood', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Homocysteine/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vitamin B 12/blood']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the climate diversity in Tunisia, the traditional pharmacopoeia consists of a wide arsenal of medicinal plant species since long used in folk medicine, in foods as spices, and in aromatherapy. Although many of these species are nearly facing extinction, only a small proportion of them have been scientifically studied. Therefore, this study explores the biochemical properties of seven spontaneous plants, which were harvested in the arid Tunisian desert: Marrubium vulgare (L.), Rhus tripartita (Ucria) D.C., Thymelaea hirsute (L.) Endl., Plantago ovata (Forsk.), Herniaria fontanesii (J. Gay.), Ziziphus lotus (L.) and Hyoscyamus albus (L.). Extracts from these plants were found to contain different types of secondary metabolites (polyphenols, flavonoids, condensed tannins, crude saponins, carotenoids and alkaloids) that are involved in important biological activities. The biological activity of the extracts obtained from each Tunisian plant was assessed: first of all, leukaemia and colon cancer cell lines (K-562 and CaCo-2 respectively) were treated with different concentrations of extracts, and then the anti-proliferative activity was observed. The results showed, in particular, how the plant extract from Rhus tripartita significantly inhibits cell proliferation, especially on the K-562 tumour cell line. Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory activity was also assessed, and the results showed that Herniaria fontanesii and Marrubium vulgare possess the highest activity in the group of analysed plants. Finally, the greatest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect was exhibited by the extract obtained from Rhus tripartita. In conclusion, all the Tunisian plants we analysed were shown to contain a remarkable amount of different bio-active compounds, thus confirming their involvement in several biological activities. Rhus tripartita and Ziziphus lotus were shown to be particularly effective in anti-proliferative activity, while Herniaria fontanesii were shown to have the best anti-inflammatory activity.","['Tlili, Hajer', 'Hanen, Najjaa', 'Ben Arfa, Abdelkerim', 'Neffati, Mohamed', 'Boubakri, Abdelbasset', 'Buonocore, Daniela', 'Dossena, Maurizia', 'Verri, Manuela', 'Doria, Enrico']","['Tlili H', 'Hanen N', 'Ben Arfa A', 'Neffati M', 'Boubakri A', 'Buonocore D', 'Dossena M', 'Verri M', 'Doria E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6805-0202'],"['Laboratory of Pastoral Ecosystems and Valorisation of Spontaneous Plants and Microorganisms, Institute of Arid Regions (IRA), Medenine, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Pastoral Ecosystems and Valorisation of Spontaneous Plants and Microorganisms, Institute of Arid Regions (IRA), Medenine, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Pastoral Ecosystems and Valorisation of Spontaneous Plants and Microorganisms, Institute of Arid Regions (IRA), Medenine, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Pastoral Ecosystems and Valorisation of Spontaneous Plants and Microorganisms, Institute of Arid Regions (IRA), Medenine, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Pastoral Ecosystems and Valorisation of Spontaneous Plants and Microorganisms, Institute of Arid Regions (IRA), Medenine, Tunisia.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190917,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6748424,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/03/05 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0213049 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-04304 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Sep 17;14(9):e0213049. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0213049. eCollection 2019.,20200304,e0213049,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytostatic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Magnoliopsida/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Tunisia']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

This multicenter, retrospective registry study of the ALWP of the EBMT assessed HCT outcomes in this population. In all, 549 patients >/=18 years with sAML following an antecedent lymphoid malignancy treated with first allograft between 2000-2016 were included. Myeloablative (MAC) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was given in 258 (47%) and 291 (53%), respectively. At 2 years, leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 31.7% (95% CI, 27.5-35.9), overall survival (OS) was 37.4% (95% CI, 33-41.8), nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 28.9% (95% CI, 25-33), and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 22.8% (95% CI, 19-26.6). In multivariate analysis, patients receiving RIC regimens had lower risk of NRM (HR: 0.58, CI: 0.40-0.83, p = 0.003), and improved LFS (HR: 0.67, CI: 0.52-0.85, p = 0.001). Patients with prior autologous HCT had inferior LFS (HR: 1.30, CI: 1.01-1.67, p = 0.01). This study demonstrates that sAML patients following prior lymphoid malignancy treated with RIC regimens have a lower risk of NRM and improved LFS, OS, and GFRS. Other variables associated with inferior outcomes include older age, active disease, adverse cytogenetics, and prior auto-HCT.","['Gatwood, Katie S', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Bruno, Lioure', 'Mailhol, Audrey', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Gatwood KS', 'Labopin M', 'Savani BN', 'Finke J', 'Socie G', 'Beelen D', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Chevallier P', 'Ganser A', 'Blaise D', 'Milpied N', 'Bruno L', 'Mailhol A', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7454-7824', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3304-9965', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5684-9447']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. katie.s.gatwood@vumc.org.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'University of Freiburg Department of Medicine-Hematology, Oncology, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology-BMT, Hospital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Hopital HURIEZ, UAM allo-CSH, CHRU, Lille, France.', ""Dept.

Since EED is a Polycomb-Group protein and a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), we tested the involvement of PICOT in the regulation of PRC2-mediated H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), transcription and translation of selected PRC2 target genes. A fraction of the cellular PICOT protein was found in the nuclei of leukemia cell lines, where it was associated with the chromatin. In addition, PICOT coimmunoprecipitated with chromatin-residing EED derived from Jurkat and COS-7 cell nuclei. PICOT knockdown led to a reduced H3K27me3 mark and a decrease in EED and EZH2 at the CCND2 gene promoter. In agreement, PICOT-deficient T cells exhibited a significant increase in CCND2 mRNA and protein expression. Since elevated expression levels of PICOT were reported in several different tumors and correlated in the current studies with decreased transcription and translation of the CCND2 gene, we tested whether this opposite correlation exists in human cancers. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated statistically significant negative correlation between PICOT and CCND2 in eight different human tumors where the highest correlation was in lung (p = 8.67E-10) and pancreatic (p = 1.06E-5) adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, high expression of PICOT and low expression of CCND2 correlated with poor patient survival in five different types of human tumors. The results suggest that PICOT binding to chromatin-associated EED modulates the H3K27me3 level at the CCND2 gene promoter which may be one of the potential mechanisms for regulation of cyclin D2 expression in tumors. These findings also indicate that a low PICOT/CCND2 expression ratio might serve as a good predictor of patient survival in selected human cancers.","['Pandya, Pinakin', 'Jethva, Minesh', 'Rubin, Eitan', 'Birnbaum, Ramon Y', 'Braiman, Alex', 'Isakov, Noah']","['Pandya P', 'Jethva M', 'Rubin E', 'Birnbaum RY', 'Braiman A', 'Isakov N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1412-0957'],"['The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and the Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 653, 84105, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and the Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 653, 84105, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and the Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 653, 84105, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 84105, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and the Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 653, 84105, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and the Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 653, 84105, Beer Sheva, Israel. noah@bgu.ac.il.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190917,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC6746821,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1935-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1935-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Sep 17;10(10):685. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1935-0.,20200923,685,,"['0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (EED protein, human)', '0 (GLRX3 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin D2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the five-year survival rate is >80%, 30% of patients experience relapse with poor prognosis. Cancer-associated gene expression profiles have been identified in several malignancies, and some transcripts have been used to predict disease prognosis. The human transcriptome is incompletely elucidated; moreover, more than 80% of transcripts can be processed via alternative splicing (AS), which increases transcript and protein diversity. The human transcriptome is divided; coding RNA accounts for 2%, and the remaining 98% is noncoding RNA. Noncoding RNA can undergo AS, promoting the diversity of noncoding transcripts. We designed specific primers to amplify previously reported alternative transcript variants of ZNF695 and showed that six ZNF695 transcript variants are co-expressed in cancer cell lines. The amplicons were sequenced and identified. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of these six transcript variants in bone marrow from B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and observed that ZNF695 transcript variants one and three were the predominant variants expressed in leukemia. Moreover, our results showed the co-expression of coding and long noncoding RNA. Finally, we observed that long noncoding RNA ZNF695 expression predicted survival rates.","['Rosa, Ricardo De la', 'Villegas-Ruiz, Vanessa', 'Caballero-Palacios, Marcela Concepcion', 'Perez-Lopez, Eleazar Israel', 'Murata, Chiharu', 'Zapata-Tarres, Martha', 'Cardenas-Cardos, Rocio', 'Paredes-Aguilera, Rogelio', 'Rivera-Luna, Roberto', 'Juarez-Mendez, Sergio']","['Rosa R', 'Villegas-Ruiz V', 'Caballero-Palacios MC', 'Perez-Lopez EI', 'Murata C', 'Zapata-Tarres M', 'Cardenas-Cardos R', 'Paredes-Aguilera R', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Juarez-Mendez S']",,"['Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Research Methodology Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Division of Pediatric Hem/Oncology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico.', 'Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Research Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City 04530, Mexico. sjuarezm@pediatria.gob.mx.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190916,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC6771147,['NOTNLM'],"['*ZNF695', '*gene expression', '*leukemia', '*lncRNAs']",2019/09/19 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['genes10090716 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10090716 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Sep 16;10(9). pii: genes10090716. doi: 10.3390/genes10090716.,20200211,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (ZNF695 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the first choice for CML therapy, however, BCR-ABL mediated drug resistance limits its clinical application and prognosis. A novel promising therapeutic strategy for CML therapy is to degrade BCR-ABL using small molecules. Antioxidant xanthohumol (XN) is a hop-derived prenylated flavonoid with multiple bioactivities. In this study, we showed XN could inhibit the proliferation, induce S phase cell cycle arrest, and stimulate apoptosis in K562 cells. XN degraded BCR-ABL in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and the involved degradation pathway was caspase activation, while not autophagy induction or ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) activation. Moreover, we revealed for the first time that XN could inhibit the UPS and autophagy in K562 cells, and the inhibitory effect of XN on autophagy could attenuate imatinib-induced autophagy and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of imatinib in K562 cells. Our present findings identified XN act as a degrader of BCR-ABL in K562 cells, and XN had potential to be developed as an alternate agent for CML therapy.","['Lu, Xuxiu', 'Geng, Jiajia', 'Zhang, Jinman', 'Miao, Jinlai', 'Liu, Ming']","['Lu X', 'Geng J', 'Zhang J', 'Miao J', 'Liu M']",,"['Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts of Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, China. miaojinlai@fio.org.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Bioactive Substances, First Institute of Oceanography, MNR, Qingdao 266061, China. miaojinlai@fio.org.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China. lmouc@ouc.edu.cn.', 'Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts of Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, China. lmouc@ouc.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory for Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Medicinal Resources, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin 541001, China. lmouc@ouc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['201762002/Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities', '81872792/Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017YFE9135000/National Key Research and Development Program of China', 'CMEMR2019-B05/State Key Laboratory for Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of', 'Medicinal Resources']",['Journal Article'],20190916,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,PMC6769755,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'K562', 'autophagy', 'caspase', 'degradation', 'xanthohumol']",2019/09/19 06:00,2019/09/19 06:01,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox8090402 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox8090402 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2019 Sep 16;8(9). pii: antiox8090402. doi: 10.3390/antiox8090402.,,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Recent discoveries in cancer epigenetics demonstrated a critical role of epigenetic dysregulation in AML pathogenesis. Unlike genetic alterations, the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications is therapeutically attractive in cancer therapy. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and plays a pivotal role in mammalian development including hematopoiesis. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) dioxygenases are responsible for the dynamics of DNA methylation. Genetic alterations of DNMTs or TETs disrupt normal hematopoiesis and subsequently result in hematological malignancies. Emerging evidence reveals that the dysregulation of DNA methylation is a key event for AML initiation and progression. Importantly, aberrant DNA methylation is regarded as a hallmark of AML, which is heralded as a powerful epigenetic marker in early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and therapeutic decision-making. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of DNA methylation in normal hematopoiesis and AML pathogenesis. We also discuss the clinical implications of DNA methylation and the current therapeutic strategies of targeting DNA methylation in AML therapy.","['Yang, Xianwen', 'Wong, Molly Pui Man', 'Ng, Ray Kit']","['Yang X', 'Wong MPM', 'Ng RK']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8684-6140'],"['School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. raykitng@hku.hk.', 'The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. raykitng@hku.hk.']",['eng'],"['02132436/Health and Medical Research Fund', '201511159059/HKU Seed Funding Programme for Basic Research', '17114117/Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190916,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6770227,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'DNA methylation', 'epigenetic biomarker', 'therapeutics']",2019/09/19 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20184576 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20184576 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Sep 16;20(18). pii: ijms20184576. doi: 10.3390/ijms20184576.,20200211,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the precise interaction sites in DOT1L, detailed interaction modes between AF10 and DOT1L, and the functional configuration of MLL1-AF10 in leukeomogenesis remain unknown. Through a combined approach of structural and functional analyses, we found that the LZ domain of AF10 interacts with the coiled-coil domains of DOT1L through a conserved binding mode and discovered that the C-terminal end of the LZ domain and the OM domain of AF10 mediate the formation of a DOT1L-AF10 octamer via tetramerization of the binary complex.

Our cytogenetic and molecular assessments of 34 patients with B-PLL revealed several disease-specific features and potential therapeutic targets. The karyotype was complex (>/=3 abnormalities) in 73% of the patients and highly complex (>/=5 abnormalities) in 45%. The most frequent chromosomal aberrations were translocations involving MYC [t(MYC)] (62%), deletion (del)17p (38%), trisomy (tri)18 (30%), del13q (29%), tri3 (24%), tri12 (24%), and del8p (23%). Twenty-six (76%) of the 34 patients exhibited an MYC aberration, resulting from mutually exclusive translocations or gains. Whole-exome sequencing revealed frequent mutations in TP53, MYD88, BCOR, MYC, SF3B1, SETD2, CHD2, CXCR4, and BCLAF1. The majority of B-PLL used the IGHV3 or IGHV4 subgroups (89%) and displayed significantly mutated IGHV genes (79%). We identified 3 distinct cytogenetic risk groups: low risk (no MYC aberration), intermediate risk (MYC aberration but no del17p), and high risk (MYC aberration and del17p) (P = .0006). In vitro drug response profiling revealed that the combination of a B-cell receptor or BCL2 inhibitor with OTX015 (a bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor targeting MYC) was associated with significantly lower viability of B-PLL cells harboring a t(MYC). We concluded that cytogenetic analysis is a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool in B-PLL. Targeting MYC may be a useful treatment option in this disease.","['Chapiro, Elise', 'Pramil, Elodie', ""Diop, M'boyba"", 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Dillard, Clementine', 'Gabillaud, Clementine', 'Maloum,

While higher viral RNA and proviral DNA loads have been correlated with progressive infections and disease, a similar correlation has been suggested for p27 antigen concentrations. This analytical study compared the results of a quantitative ELISA for p27 antigen with quantitative real-time PCR results for FeLV proviral DNA in patient samples. A significant positive correlation between copies of proviral DNA and the concentration of p27 antigen was identified (r=0.761, P<0.0001). Samples with high proviral DNA loads, at least 1x10(6) copies/mL of whole blood, typically had p27 antigen concentrations greater than 30ng/mL in plasma. Samples with proviral DNA loads below this level all had concentrations of p27 antigen in plasma that were less than 10ng/mL. Given this correlation, it is hypothesized that the concentration of p27 antigen at a given point in time may help to indicate the likelihood of a progressive or regressive infection similar to what has been demonstrated for proviral DNA loads.","['Beall, Melissa J', 'Buch, Jesse', 'Cahill, Roberta J', 'Clark, Genevieve', 'Hanscom, Jancy', 'Estrada, Marko', 'Leutenegger, Christian M', 'Chandrashekar, Ramaswamy']","['Beall MJ', 'Buch J', 'Cahill RJ', 'Clark G', 'Hanscom J', 'Estrada M', 'Leutenegger CM', 'Chandrashekar R']",,"['IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., 1 IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, ME 04092, USA.

For these reasons, MC is considered an attractive therapeutic target for allergic disease treatment. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of WZ3146, N-[3-[5-chloro-2-[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)anilino]pyrimidin-4-yl]oxyphenyl]prop -2-enamide, and the mechanisms of its actions on the MC activation and IgE-mediated allergic response by using three types of MCs such as rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells, mouse bone marrow mast cells (BMMCs), and human Laboratory of Allergic Diseases 2 (LAD2) cells. WZ3146 inhibited antigen-stimulated degranulation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, ~ 0.35muM for RBL-2H3 cells; ~ 0.39muM for BMMCs; ~ 0.41 for LAD2 cells). WZ3146 also suppressed the production of histamine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, which mediate various allergic responses, in a dose-dependent manner. As the mechanism of WZ3146 to inhibit MCs, it inhibited the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and the downstream signaling proteins of Syk such as linker for activation of T cell (LAT) and phospholipase (PL) Cgamma1 in the signaling pathway of FcepsilonRI. In addition, WZ3146 inhibited the activation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). However, WZ3146 did not inhibit degranulation of MCs by thapsigargin or ionomycin, which increase calcium concentration in cytosol. Notably, WZ3146 inhibited the activity of Lyn and Fyn, but not Syk. In an following animal experiment, WZ3146 inhibited IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in a dose-dependent manner (ED50, ~ 20mg/kg). Taken together, in this study we show that the pyrimidine derivative, WZ3146, inhibits the IgE-mediated allergic response by inhibiting Lyn and Fyn Src-family kinases, which are initially activated by antigen stimulation in MCs. Therefore, we propose that WZ3146 could be used as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic diseases.","['Park, Young Hwan', 'Kim, Do Kyun', 'Kim, Hyuk Soon', 'Lee, Dajeong', 'Lee, Min Bum', 'Min, Keun Young', 'Jo, Min Geun', 'Lee, Ji Eon', 'Kim, Young Mi', 'Choi, Wahn Soo']","['Park YH', 'Kim DK', 'Kim HS', 'Lee D', 'Lee MB', 'Min KY', 'Jo MG', 'Lee JE', 'Kim YM', 'Choi WS']",,"['Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.', ""College of Pharmacy, Duksung Women's University, Seoul 01369, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Republic of Korea.

DESIGN: Longitudinal, repeated measures, single case-study. METHODS: The player was followed prior to (control), and during (study), an in-season block of altitude training. During the control period two venesections were performed for a total of 750mL of blood removal. Internal and external training load, match statistics, blood volume, plasma volume, haemoglobin mass, serum ferritin and reticulocyte count were monitored throughout. RESULTS: During the control period serum ferritin declined following the two venesections ( approximately 51%) as did haemoglobin mass ( approximately 2%), reticulocyte count remained stable. During the study period serum ferritin further declined ( approximately 30%), however haemoglobin mass and reticulocyte count increased ( approximately 4% and approximately 14% respectively). Internal training load for the control and study period was similar, however external training load was lower in the study period. Match statistics were not favourable for the player during the control period, however they improved during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This case supports the theory that individuals with elevated iron availability are well placed to achieve increases in haemoglobin mass. Furthermore, although therapeutic venesections may still be required to manage iron overload, the addition of altitude exposure may be a method to assist in reducing total body iron by means of mobilising available (excessive) iron to incorporate into haemoglobin. Altitude exposure did not hinder the players' performance. Further research is encouraged.","['Serpell, Benjamin G', 'Freeman, Stephen', 'Ritchie, David', 'Choi, Philip', 'Periard, Julien D', 'Sharma, Avish P']","['Serpell BG', 'Freeman S', 'Ritchie D', 'Choi P', 'Periard JD', 'Sharma AP']",,"['University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise (UCRISE), Australia; Brumbies Rugby, Australia.

The expression of HEIH in breast tumor tissues and breast cancer cells was determined, followed by investigating the effects and regulatory mechanism of HEIH dysregulation on breast cancer cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The expression of HEIH was upregulated in breast cancer tissue samples and cell lines. Suppression of HEIH inhibited cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis, and decreased migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, a negative relationship existed between HEIH and miR-200b, and HEIH regulated breast cancer development via regulating miR-200b. Pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) was verified as a functional target of miR-200b, and miR-200b regulated the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells through targeting PBX3. Furthermore, suppression of HEIH inhibited the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which was remarkably reversed after suppression of HEIH and inhibition of miR-200b synchronously. Our results reveal that HEIH may contribute to breast cancer development via modulation of microRNA-200b/axis and inducing the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Further studies are still required to confirm our findings.","['Zhao, Jie', 'Meng, Ran', 'Yao, Qiang', 'Wang, Hui', 'Niu, Jingxiu', 'Cui, Y U', 'Chen, Songlin', 'Bai, Yinshuang']","['Zhao J', 'Meng R', 'Yao Q', 'Wang H', 'Niu J', 'Cui YU', 'Chen S', 'Bai Y']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1691/ph.2019.9428 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmazie. 2019 Aug 1;74(8):471-476. doi: 10.1691/ph.2019.9428.,20200611,471-476,,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN200 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study in patients who developed FN while undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia. PCT and CRP were obtained in patients who presented with FN. Blood cultures also were obtained. The primary goals were to evaluate the ability of PCT and CRP to predict bacteremia in patients with FN. The secondary goals were to assess the prognostic role of PCT and CRP and to assess the microbiologic profile and culture sensitivity patterns in the study population. RESULTS: A total of 124 episodes of FN that involved 67 patients with acute leukemia occurred in the study. PCT was superior to CRP in the prediction of bacteremia. The median PCT level in the bacteremia group was 3.25 ng/mL compared with 0.51 ng/mL in the group without bacteremia (P < .01). The median values of CRP in the bacteremia and without-bacteremia groups were 119.3 mg/L and 94.5 mg/L, respectively (P = .07). There were no differences in median PCT and CRP in patients who died and those who improved. Of the 42 positive cultures, Gram-negative bacteremia was common (86%), and Escherichia coli was the most frequent organism isolated. Carbapenem resistance was seen in 39% of positive cultures. CONCLUSION: PCT is an effective biomarker to predict bacteremia in patients with FN undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia.","['Shilpakar, Ramila', 'Paudel, Bishnu Dutta', 'Neupane, Prakash', 'Shah, Aarati', 'Acharya, Bibek', 'Dulal, Soniya', 'Wood, Lori Anne', 'Shahi, Rukmani', 'Khanal, Usha', 'Poudyal, Bishesh Sharma']","['Shilpakar R', 'Paudel BD', 'Neupane P', 'Shah A', 'Acharya B', 'Dulal S', 'Wood LA', 'Shahi R', 'Khanal U', 'Poudyal BS']",,"['National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS.', 'National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Civil Service Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'Civil Service Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'Civil Service Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Glob Oncol,Journal of global oncology,101674751,PMC6872183,,,2019/09/19 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JGO.19.00147 [doi]'],ppublish,J Glob Oncol. 2019 Sep;5:1-6. doi: 10.1200/JGO.19.00147.,20200407,1-6,,"['0 (Procalcitonin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacteremia/*diagnostic imaging', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nepal', 'Procalcitonin/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent case reports describe the incorporation of levocarnitine (LC) supplementation into PEG-ASNase-containing induction regimens to prevent or treat hepatotoxicity. Because LC facilitates the metabolism of free fatty acids (FFA), a primary fuel source for ALL cells, LC could potentially interfere with ALL chemotherapy efficacy. To test this, we employed in vitro and in vivo models of ALL. We show in vitro that LC supplementation does not impact cytotoxicity from vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, or ASNase on human ALL cells nor lead to an increase in ALL cell metabolic rate. In vivo, we demonstrate LC does not impair PEG-ASNase monotherapy in mice with syngeneic ALL. Together, our findings show that LC supplementation is a safe strategy to prevent/reverse ASNase-induced toxicities in preclinical models.","['Sea, Jessica L', 'Orgel, Etan', 'Chen, Ting', 'Paszkiewicz, Rebecca L', 'Krall, Abigail S', 'Oberley, Matthew J', 'Stiles, Linsey', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Sea JL', 'Orgel E', 'Chen T', 'Paszkiewicz RL', 'Krall AS', 'Oberley MJ', 'Stiles L', 'Mittelman SD']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3812-9032', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2867-1298']","[""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, UCLA Children's Discovery and Innovation Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190916,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,PMC7305023,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*PEG-asparaginase', '*hepatotoxicity', '*levocarnitine (L-carnitine)']",2019/09/19 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1666379 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Feb;61(2):420-428. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1666379.

The BCR-FGFR1 variant is unique in that the BCR component contributes a serine-threonine kinase (STK) to the N-terminal end of the chimeric FGFR1 kinase. We have deleted the STK domain and mutated the critical Y177 residue and demonstrate that the transforming activity of these mutated genes is reduced compared to the BCR-FGFR1 parental kinase. In addition, we demonstrate that deletion of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain abrogates transforming ability, which is not compensated for by BCR STK activity. Unbiased screening for proteins that are inactivated as a result of loss of the BCR STK identified activated S6 kinase and SHP2 kinase. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 function in SCLL cells expressing BCR-FGFR1 in vitro leads to reduced viability and increased apoptosis. In vivo treatment of SCLL in mice with SHP099 leads to suppression of leukemogenesis, supporting an important role for SHP2 in FGFR1-driven leukemogenesis. In combination with the BGJ398 FGFR1 inhibitor, cell viability in vitro is further suppressed and acts synergistically with SHP099 in vivo suggesting a potential combined targeted therapy option in this subtype of SCLL disease.","['Chong, Yating', 'Liu, Yun', 'Lu, Sumin', 'Cai, Baohuan', 'Qin, Haiyan', 'Chang, Chang-Sheng', 'Ren, Mingqiang', 'Cowell, John K', 'Hu, Tianxiang']","['Chong Y', 'Liu Y', 'Lu S', 'Cai B', 'Qin H', 'Chang CS', 'Ren M', 'Cowell JK', 'Hu T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2079-5950', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5127-9211']","['Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.']",['eng'],"['CA16672/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA076167/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191010,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,['NOTNLM'],"['*FGFR1', '*SHP2', '*leukemia', '*serine-threonine kinase', '*tyrosine kinase']",2019/09/17 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32665 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Apr 15;146(8):2243-2254. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32665.

These interactions are often dynamic, sometimes transient, typically occur over large topographically shallow protein surfaces, and can exhibit a broad range of affinities. Considerable progress has been made in determining PPI structures. However, given the above properties, understanding the key determinants of their thermodynamic stability remains a challenge in chemical biology. An improved ability to identify and engineer PPIs would advance understanding of biological mechanisms and mutant phenotypes and also provide a firmer foundation for inhibitor design. In silico prediction of PPI hot-spot amino acids using computational alanine scanning (CAS) offers a rapid approach for predicting key residues that drive protein-protein association. This can be applied to all known PPI structures; however there is a trade-off between throughput and accuracy. Here we describe a comparative analysis of multiple CAS methods, which highlights effective approaches to improve the accuracy of predicting hot-spot residues. Alongside this, we introduce a new method, BUDE Alanine Scanning, which can be applied to single structures from crystallography and to structural ensembles from NMR or molecular dynamics data. The comparative analyses facilitate accurate prediction of hot-spots that we validate experimentally with three diverse targets: NOXA-B/MCL-1 (an alpha-helix-mediated PPI), SIMS/SUMO, and GKAP/SHANK-PDZ (both beta-strand-mediated interactions). Finally, the approach is applied to the accurate prediction of hot-spot residues at a topographically novel Affimer/BCL-xL protein-protein interface.","['Ibarra, Amaurys A', 'Bartlett, Gail J', 'Hegedus, Zsofia', 'Dutt, Som', 'Hobor, Fruzsina', 'Horner, Katherine A', 'Hetherington, Kristina', 'Spence, Kirstin', 'Nelson, Adam', 'Edwards, Thomas A', 'Woolfson, Derek N', 'Sessions, Richard B', 'Wilson, Andrew J']","['Ibarra AA', 'Bartlett GJ', 'Hegedus Z', 'Dutt S', 'Hobor F', 'Horner KA', 'Hetherington K', 'Spence K', 'Nelson A', 'Edwards TA', 'Woolfson DN', 'Sessions RB', 'Wilson AJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0394-3202', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0320-0895', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9852-6366']","['School of Biochemistry , University of Bristol , Medical Sciences Building, University Walk , Bristol BS8 1TD , U.K.', ""School of Chemistry , University of Bristol , Cantock's Close , Bristol BS8 1TS , U.K."", 'School of Chemistry , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Chemistry , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Chemistry , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Chemistry , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Chemistry , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'School of Biochemistry , University of Bristol , Medical Sciences Building, University Walk , Bristol BS8 1TD , U.K.', ""School of Chemistry , University of Bristol , Cantock's Close , Bristol BS8 1TS , U.K."", 'BrisSynBio , University of Bristol , Life Sciences Building, Tyndall Avenue , Bristol BS8 1TQ , U.K.', 'School of Biochemistry , University of Bristol , Medical Sciences Building, University Walk , Bristol BS8 1TD , U.K.', 'BrisSynBio , University of Bristol , Life Sciences Building, Tyndall Avenue , Bristol BS8 1TQ , U.K.', 'School of Chemistry , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.', 'Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , Woodhouse Lane , Leeds LS2 9JT , U.K.']",['eng'],"['BB/L01386X/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', '097827/Z/11/A/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT094232M/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '094232/Z/10/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190927,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,PMC6804253,,,2019/09/17 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.9b00560 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2019 Oct 18;14(10):2252-2263. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.9b00560.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are non-coding DNA sequences that contain binding sites for transcriptional regulators to modulate gene expression. Alterations of CREs have been implicated in various diseases including cancer. While promoters and enhancers have been the primary CREs for studying gene regulation, very little is known about the role of silencer, which is another type of CRE that mediates gene repression. Originally identified as an adaptive immunity system in prokaryotes, CRISPR/Cas9 has been exploited to be a powerful tool for eukaryotic genome editing. Here, we present the use of this technique to delete an intronic silencer in the human RUNX1 gene and investigate the impacts on gene expression in OCI-AML3 leukemic cells. Our approach relies on electroporation-mediated delivery of two preassembled Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to create two double-strand breaks (DSBs) that flank the silencer. Deletions can be readily screened by fragment analysis. Expression analyses of different mRNAs transcribed from alternative promoters help evaluate promoter-dependent effects. This strategy can be used to study other CREs and is particularly suitable for hematopoietic cells, which are often difficult to transfect with plasmid-based methods. The use of a plasmid- and virus-free strategy allows simple and fast assessments of gene regulatory functions.","['Cheng, Chi-Keung', 'Wong, Terry H Y', 'Yung, Yuk-Lin', 'Chan, Nelson C N', 'Ng, Margaret H L']","['Cheng CK', 'Wong THY', 'Yung YL', 'Chan NCN', 'Ng MHL']",,"['Blood Cancer Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.', 'Blood Cancer Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.', 'Blood Cancer Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.', 'Blood Cancer Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.', 'Blood Cancer Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong; State Key Laboratory in Oncology in South China, The Chinese University of Hong Kong; margaretng@cuhk.edu.hk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20190901,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,,,2019/09/17 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/60130 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Sep 1;(151). doi: 10.3791/60130.,20200625,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Guide)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Editing/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Guide/genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the largest cross-indication review comparing RWE to CT results, aspiring to inform clinical practice and decision-making when funding hemato-oncology pharmaceuticals.Areas covered: The review methodology focused on identifying all novel agents that entered EU landscape between 2012 and 2016 by using European Medicines Agency (EMA) database, while conducting a systematic PubMed literature review of RWE in the specific hematological malignancies, in order to compare RWE versus CT efficacy endpoints.Expert opinion: In total, 18 international nonproprietary names (INNs) that received EMA approval for any indication were included and the registrational efficacy results are presented. Eight (44%) INNs proved to have relevant RWE generated in at least one approved indication. The analysis of findings revealed high variability in terms of RWE availability and transferability of CT results to relevant real-life experience among the disease areas investigated.","['Petrakis, Ioannis', 'Kontogiorgis, Christos', 'Nena, Evangelia', 'Athanasakis, Kostas', 'Gougoula, Vasiliki', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Constantinidis, Theodoros C']","['Petrakis I', 'Kontogiorgis C', 'Nena E', 'Athanasakis K', 'Gougoula V', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Constantinidis TC']",,"['Laboratory of Hygiene and Environmental Protection, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Hygiene and Environmental Protection, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Hygiene and Environmental Protection, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Health Economics, National School of Public Health, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Hygiene and Environmental Protection, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Hygiene and Environmental Protection, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20190924,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematological malignancies', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*myeloma', '*real-world evidence']",2019/09/17 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1668763 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Dec;12(12):1063-1075. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1668763.

We analyzed the hormonal markers of gonadal function in adolescent leukemia survivors, treated in childhood with different levels of aggressiveness. We analyzed hormone levels in 69 adolescents and young adults, leukemia survivors stratified into standard (SR), intermediate (IR), and high (HR) risk groups, and in 80 healthy controls (38 men) at a similar age. We assessed follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and inhibin B in the whole group, testosterone in males, and E2 and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in females. Males classified into HR group presented, in comparison to control, higher levels of FSH, LH, lower inhibin B, and normal testosterone, whereas in SR and IR group, the hormonal values were comparable to the control. In females, in all risk groups, the levels of FSH, LH, E2, and inhibin B were comparable with the control, but the mean AMH levels were slightly lowered. We did not observe the effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation (12 or 18 Gy) or the time of treatment (before vs. during puberty) on hormone levels. In females, a positive correlation was found between the time interval after the end of treatment and AMH levels. Male leukemia survivors having undergone more intensive chemotherapy show the symptoms of disturbed spermatogenesis and need to be followed-up in the future. Women, irrespective of the risk group, can develop the signs of preterm ovarian insufficiency. They should be informed about the impact of the treatment on gonadal function.","['Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Plonowski, Marcin', 'Leszczynska, Elzbieta', 'Latoch, Eryk', 'Sawicka-Zukowska, Malgorzata', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Skalska-Sadowska, Jolanta', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Sga-Pondel, Dorota', 'Kazanowska, Bernarda', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Stachowicz-Stencel, Teresa', 'Stefanowicz, Joanna', 'Malinowska, Iwona', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Kotan, Andrzej', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Pobudejska-Pieniazek, Aneta', 'Szczepanski, Teresa', 'Przybyszewski, Borys', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Szymanska-Miller, Dorota', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R', 'Kamienska, Elzbieta', 'Urasinski, Tomasz', 'Wawrzenczyk, Anna', 'Zelazowska-Rutkowska, Beata', 'Cylwik, Bogdan']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Plonowski M', 'Leszczynska E', 'Latoch E', 'Sawicka-Zukowska M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Skalska-Sadowska J', 'Wachowiak J', 'Sga-Pondel D', 'Kazanowska B', 'Chybicka A', 'Stachowicz-Stencel T', 'Stefanowicz J', 'Malinowska I', 'Matysiak M', 'Kotan A', 'Wysocki M', 'Pobudejska-Pieniazek A', 'Szczepanski T', 'Przybyszewski B', 'Badowska W', 'Szymanska-Miller D', 'Kowalczyk JR', 'Kamienska E', 'Urasinski T', 'Wawrzenczyk A', 'Zelazowska-Rutkowska B', 'Cylwik B']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8137-0948'],"['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Institute of Pediatrics, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Institute of Pediatrics, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children State Hospital, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children State Hospital, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, W.

However, many clinical trials indicated severe ASNase toxicity in patients with solid tumors, with resistant mechanisms not well understood. Here, we took a functional genetic approach and identified SLC1A3 as a novel contributor to ASNase resistance in cancer cells. In combination with ASNase, SLC1A3 inhibition caused cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and myriads of metabolic vulnerabilities in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, nucleotides biosynthesis, energy production, redox homeostasis, and lipid biosynthesis. SLC1A3 is an aspartate and glutamate transporter, mainly expressed in brain tissues, but high expression levels were also observed in some tumor types. Here, we demonstrate that ASNase stimulates aspartate and glutamate consumptions, and their refilling through SLC1A3 promotes cancer cell proliferation. Lastly, in vivo experiments indicated that SLC1A3 expression promoted tumor development and metastasis while negating the suppressive effects of ASNase by fueling aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine metabolisms despite of asparagine shortage. Altogether, our findings identify a novel role for SLC1A3 in ASNase resistance and suggest that restrictive aspartate and glutamate uptake might improve ASNase efficacy with solid tumors.","['Sun, Jianhui', 'Nagel, Remco', 'Zaal, Esther A', 'Ugalde, Alejandro Pineiro', 'Han, Ruiqi', 'Proost, Natalie', 'Song, Ji-Ying', 'Pataskar, Abhijeet', 'Burylo, Artur', 'Fu, Haigen', 'Poelarends, Gerrit J', 'van de Ven, Marieke', 'van Tellingen, Olaf', 'Berkers, Celia R', 'Agami, Reuven']","['Sun J', 'Nagel R', 'Zaal EA', 'Ugalde AP', 'Han R', 'Proost N', 'Song JY', 'Pataskar A', 'Burylo A', 'Fu H', 'Poelarends GJ', 'van de Ven M', 'van Tellingen O', 'Berkers CR', 'Agami R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2848-2473'],"['Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Preclinical Intervention Unit and Pharmacology Unit of the Mouse Clinic for Cancer and Ageing (MCCA), The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Experimental Animal Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Pharmacology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Preclinical Intervention Unit and Pharmacology Unit of the Mouse Clinic for Cancer and Ageing (MCCA), The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Pharmacology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['201503250056/China Scholarship Council/International', 'KWF 0315/2016/Dutch Cancer Society/International', 'ERC-PoC 665317/ERC_/European Research Council/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190916,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,PMC6826201,['NOTNLM'],"['*L-asparaginase', '*SLC1A3', '*aspartate/glutamate', '*genome-wide CRISPR screen', '*solid tumors']",2019/09/17 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.15252/embj.2019102147 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2019 Oct 4;38(21):e102147. doi: 10.15252/embj.2019102147.

However, the use of a single sample per participant in these studies has limited etiologic inferences. We report findings, overall and by NHL subtype, from a case-control analysis (422 cases, 434 controls) within the Janus Serum Bank with two samples per subject collected on average 5 years apart. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) was associated with elevated sCD27 in the later, but not earlier, prediagnostic sample (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-11.6 and 1.7, 0.7-4.7 per log increase, respectively) in analyses adjusting for both analytes, while follicular lymphoma (FL) was associated with elevated sCD30 in both the later and earlier samples (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-4.4 and 2.3, 1.2-4.4, respectively). CLL/SLL cases were significantly more likely than controls to have higher sCD27 in the later vs. earlier sample (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9 per standard deviation increase); no such difference in sCD30 was apparent for FL. In a joint analysis, NHL cases were more likely than controls to have below-median sCD27 in the earlier sample and above-median sCD27 in the later sample (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3). For sCD30, the association between sCD30 and FL was confined to subjects with above-median analyte levels in both samples (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.9). Our findings are compatible with elevated sCD27 representing a disease-induced effect and sCD30 representing a marker of increased FL susceptibility.","['Purdue, Mark P', 'Lan, Qing', 'Langseth, Hilde', 'Grimsrud, Tom K', 'Hildesheim, Allan', 'Rothman, Nathaniel']","['Purdue MP', 'Lan Q', 'Langseth H', 'Grimsrud TK', 'Hildesheim A', 'Rothman N']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1177-3108', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0257-2363']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', 'Department of Research, Institute of Population-based Cancer Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Research, Institute of Population-based Cancer Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20191011,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cohort studies', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*sCD27', '*sCD30', '*serum']",2019/09/17 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32684 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Jun 15;146(12):3312-3319. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32684.

It is a manifestation of various diseases, and its etiology can be explained on the basis of bone marrow examination. The study aims to determine the etiological factors leading to pancytopenia via bone marrow examination in pediatric patients presenting in our hospital. Materials and methods This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Pathology at a public sector tertiary care hospital. Data were recorded by convenience sampling from the patients' database from January 2015 to April 2018. Patients aged 2 months to 15 years who had pancytopenia on peripheral blood smear and were admitted for bone marrow examination were included in the study. Patients who were beyond these age limits, diagnosed cases of aplastic anemia and leukemia, and those with a recent history of blood transfusion were excluded from the study. The analysis was done via the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v.23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA), and descriptive statistics were applied. Results Of 115 cases, 58 (50.4%) were males and 57 (49.6%) were females. Megaloblastic anemia was present in 32 (27.8%) patients, and it was the most common cause of pancytopenia. Non-malignant disorders were seen in 95 cases (82.6%) and malignant disorders were seen in 20 (17.4%) cases. Conclusion Megaloblastic anemia is the most common cause, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common malignant cause of pancytopenia in children. There was no significant gender predilection among causes of pancytopenia.","['Zeeshan, Raana', 'Irshad, Bilal', 'Aslam, Muhammad A', 'Khan, Muhammad T', 'Bhatti, Hamza Waqar', 'Chaudhary, Noman A']","['Zeeshan R', 'Irshad B', 'Aslam MA', 'Khan MT', 'Bhatti HW', 'Chaudhary NA']",,"['Pathology, Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi, PAK.', 'Pathology, Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, PAK.', 'Pathology, Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, PAK.', 'Internal Medicine, Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, PAK.', 'Surgery, Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, PAK.', 'Surgery, Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, PAK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190711,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC6741365,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow examination', 'hematological disorders', 'pancytopenia']",2019/09/17 06:00,2019/09/17 06:01,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.5124 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2019 Jul 11;11(7):e5124. doi: 10.7759/cureus.5124.,,e5124,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

To detect key genes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MLL-R infant ALL, microarray expression data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MLL-R and non-MLL-R infant ALL were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were carried out. Then, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identified the hub genes. Finally, drug-gene interactions were mined. A total of 139 cases of MLL-R infant ALL including 77 (55.4%) fusions with AF4, 38 (27.3%) with ENL, 14 (10.1%) with AF9, and 10 (7.2%) other gene fusions were characterized. A total of 236 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated DEGs were identified. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in homophilic cell adhesion, negative regulation of apoptotic process and cellular response to drug GO terms, while down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix organization, protein kinase C signaling and neuron projection extension GO terms. The up-regulated DEGs were enriched in seven KEGG pathways, mainly involving transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways, and down-regulated DEGs were involved in three main KEGG pathways including Alzheimer's disease, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and hematopoietic cell lineage.

Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by accumulation of malignantly transformed immature myeloid precursors, and differentiation therapy, used to overcome this differentiation blockage, has become a successful therapeutic option. The human HL-60 acute leukemia cell line serves as a cell culture model for granulocytic maturation, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) incubation leads to its differentiation towards neutrophil-like cells, as assessed by biochemical, functional and morphological parameters. DMSO-induced HL-60 cell differentiation constitutes an excellent model to examine molecular processes that turn a proliferating immortal leukemic cell line into mature non-proliferating and apoptosis-prone neutrophil-like end cells. By performing genome-wide miRNA profiling and functional assays, we have identified a signature of 86 differentially expressed canonical miRNAs (51 upregulated; 35 downregulated) during DMSO-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate miRNA expression. Among these differentially expressed canonical miRNAs, we found miR-125a-5p upregulation and miR-17-92 cluster downregulation acted as major regulators of granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells. Enforced expression of miR-125a-5p promoted granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells, whereas miR-17-92 ectopic expression inhibited DMSO-induced HL-60 granulocytic differentiation. Ectopic expression of miR-125a-5p also promoted granulocytic differentiation in human acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells, as well as in naive human primary CD34(+)-hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. These findings provide novel molecular insights into the identification of miRNAs regulating granulocytic differentiation of human leukemia cells and normal CD34(+)-hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells, and may assist in the development of novel miRNA-targeted therapies for leukemia.","['Dakir, El-Habib', 'Mollinedo, Faustino']","['Dakir el-H', 'Mollinedo F']",,"['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Faculty of Biology, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Cell Death and Cancer Therapy, Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190903,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6731105,['NOTNLM'],"['*human', '*miR-125a-5p', '*miR-17-92', '*miRNA', '*neutrophil differentiation']",2019/09/17 06:00,2019/09/17 06:01,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27123 [doi]', '27123 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Sep 3;10(51):5313-5331. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27123. eCollection 2019 Sep 3.,,5313-5331,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

An untapped alternative is to enhance the efficacy and safety of existing cancer drugs. We hypothesized that the response to topoisomerase II poisons, a very successful group of cancer drugs, can be improved by considering treatment-associated transcript levels. To this end, we analyzed transcriptomes from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell lines treated with the topoisomerase II poison etoposide. Using complementary criteria of co-regulation within networks and of essentiality for cell survival, we identified and functionally confirmed 11 druggable drivers of etoposide cytotoxicity. Drivers with pre-treatment expression predicting etoposide response (e.g., PARP9) generally synergized with etoposide. Drivers repressed by etoposide (e.g., PLK1) displayed standalone cytotoxicity. Drivers, whose modulation evoked etoposide-like gene expression changes (e.g., mTOR), were cytotoxic both alone and in combination with etoposide. In summary, both pre-treatment gene expression and treatment-driven changes contribute to the cell killing effect of etoposide. Such targets can be tweaked to enhance the efficacy of etoposide. This strategy can be used to identify combination partners or even replacements for other classical anticancer drugs, especially those interfering with DNA integrity and transcription.","['More, Piyush', 'Goedtel-Armbrust, Ute', 'Shah, Viral', 'Mathaes, Marianne', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A', 'Wojnowski, Leszek']","['More P', 'Goedtel-Armbrust U', 'Shah V', 'Mathaes M', 'Kindler T', 'Andrade-Navarro MA', 'Wojnowski L']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Computational Biology and Data Mining, Faculty of Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190903,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6731103,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'cancer essentiality', 'combination therapy', 'gene expression', 'topoisomerase II poisons']",2019/09/17 06:00,2019/09/17 06:01,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27112 [doi]', '27112 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Sep 3;10(51):5298-5312. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27112. eCollection 2019 Sep 3.,,5298-5312,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, it may open up an opportunity to target LSCs by breaking the close connection between LSCs and the BMM. The elimination of LSCs is of high importance, since they follow cancer stem cell theory as a part of this population. Based on cancer stem cell theory, a cell with stem cell-like features stands at the apex of the hierarchy and produces a heterogeneous population and governs the disease. Secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles, whether through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms by activation of downstream signaling pathways in LSCs, favors their persistence and makes the BMM less hospitable for normal stem cells. While all details about the interactions of the BMM and LSCs remain to be elucidated, some clinical trials have been designed to limit these reciprocal interactions to cure leukemia more effectively. In this review, we focus on chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia LSCs and their milieu in the bone marrow, how to segregate them from the normal compartment, and finally the possible ways to eliminate these cells.","['Houshmand, Mohammad', 'Blanco, Teresa Mortera', 'Circosta, Paola', 'Yazdi, Narjes', 'Kazemi, Alireza', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Zarif, Mahin Nikougoftar']","['Houshmand M', 'Blanco TM', 'Circosta P', 'Yazdi N', 'Kazemi A', 'Saglio G', 'Zarif MN']",,"['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin 10126, Italy.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm 14183, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin 10126, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Tehran Medical Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran 1916893813, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1985717443, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin 10126, Italy.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran 146651157, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,World J Stem Cells,World journal of stem cells,101535826,PMC6716085,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bone marrow microenvironment', 'Bone marrow niche', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemic stem cell', 'Target therapy']",2019/09/17 06:00,2019/09/17 06:01,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4252/wjsc.v11.i8.476 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Stem Cells. 2019 Aug 26;11(8):476-490. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v11.i8.476.,,476-490,,,,,['Conflict-of-interest statement: There is no conflict of interest for any author.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of ecthyma gangrenosum can be associated with severe systemic infection often with a fatal prognosis. Most cases of ecthyma gangrenosum occur around the axilla, buttocks, and limbs; the scrotum is rarely affected. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old male with previously diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia, presented with left scrotal pain, fever, and rigors. Physical examination showed 2 ulcerating lesions with central black eschars surrounded by erythematous halos on the superior aspect of the left scrotum. Diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum was confirmed as both blood and lesion cultures showed growth of P. aeruginosa. After early empiric antibiotic treatment, the lesions significantly improved, and no sign of recurrence or new lesions was noticed. CONCLUSIONS Ecthyma gangrenosum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ulcerating lesions of the scrotum. An early diagnosis and aggressive antibiotic treatment are imperative for resolution of this infection.","['Rodriguez, Jose A', 'Eckardt, Paula A', 'Lemos-Ramirez, Juan C', 'Niu, Jianli']","['Rodriguez JA', 'Eckardt PA', 'Lemos-Ramirez JC', 'Niu J']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Memorial Hospital West, Memorial Healthcare System, Pembroke Pines, FL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Memorial Regional Hospital, Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Memorial Regional Hospital, Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL, USA.', 'Office of Human Research, Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190916,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,PMC6767951,,,2019/09/17 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['917443 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.917443 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Sep 16;20:1369-1372. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.917443.,20200203,1369-1372,,,IM,"['Aged', 'Ecthyma/*microbiology', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*diagnosis', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation & purification', 'Scrotum/*microbiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Further treatment intensification to improve the cure rate is not feasible as it will increase the number of toxic deaths. Hence, about 20% of pediatric patients relapse and often die due to acquired therapy resistance. Personalized medicine is of utmost importance to further increase cure rates and is achieved by targeting specific initiation, maintenance or resistance mechanisms of the disease. Genomic sequencing has revealed mutations that characterize genetic subtypes of many cancers including T-ALL. However, leukemia may have various activated pathways that are not accompanied by the presence of mutations. Therefore, screening for mutations alone is not sufficient to identify all molecular targets and leukemic dependencies for therapeutic inhibition.

METHODS: The messenger RNA expression of the MAP4K family members in 151 patients with acute myeloid leukemia was extracted from the OncoLnc database. Data for gender, age, cytogenetic, leukocyte count, CD34, FAB classification, RUNX1, and TP53 were provided by the University of California-Santa Cruz Xena platform. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model provided an estimate of the hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals for overall survival. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated favorable overall survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia attributing to high expression of MAP4K3, MAP4K4, and MAP4K5 and low expression of MAP4K1 (adjusted P = .005, P = .022, P = .002, and P = .024; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.490, 95% confidence interval = 0.297-0.809, hazard ratio = 0.598, 95% confidence interval = 0.385-0.928, hazard ratio = 0.490, 95% confidence interval = 0.310-0.776, and hazard ratio = 0.615, 95% confidence interval = 0.403-0.938, respectively). Combining the high-expressing MAP4K3, MAP4K4, and MAP4K5 with the low-expressing MAP4K1 in a joint effect analysis predicted a favorable prognosis of overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: High expression of MAP4K3, MAP4K4, and MAP4K5 combined with low expression of MAP4K1 can serve as a sensitive tool to predict favorable overall survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Bai, Zhenjie', 'Yao, Qingmei', 'Sun, Zhongyi', 'Xu, Fang', 'Zhou, Jicheng']","['Bai Z', 'Yao Q', 'Sun Z', 'Xu F', 'Zhou J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6844-7085'],"['Department of Medical Hematopathy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, P.R.

Although ligand binding assays in microwells provide a promising approach for measuring single-cell secretions, their throughput is limited. Recently, droplet assays have been developed for high-throughput single-cell screening. However, because washing steps are difficult to perform with droplets, there are still challenges in measuring secretions using droplet assays. In this study, a plasmonic droplet screen approach is developed for one-step washing-free multiplex detection of single-cell secretions. Individual cells are encapsulated with antibody-conjugated gold nanorods (AuNRs) in droplets to evaluate their secretion levels. The shift in the plasmon resonance peak reflects the amount of secreted protein without needing additional indicator and washing steps. The plasmonic signals from a continuous flow of single-cell droplets are collected by dark-field spectroscopy ( approximately 100-150cells min(-1)). This platform is tested by screening interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted from suspended leukemia cells and adherent breast cancer cells. Overall, this novel strategy shows the potential and flexibility of high-efficiency multiplex single-cell secretion analysis.","['Wei, Shih-Chung', 'Hsu, Myat Noe', 'Chen, Chia-Hung']","['Wei SC', 'Hsu MN', 'Chen CH']",,"['Institute for Health Innovation & Technology, National University of Singapore, 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, 117574, Singapore.', 'Institute for Health Innovation & Technology, National University of Singapore, 117599, Singapore; Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, 117574, Singapore.

MDM2 antagonists have shown efficacy in treating malignancies with MDM2 overexpression and can overcome chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia. We systematically evaluated the safety profile of MDM2 inhibitors in the treatment of solid organ and hematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Medline and EMBASE from January 1947 to November 2018 for prospective clinical studies, in English or French, investigating any MDM2 inhibitor in pediatric or adult cancers, and reporting dose and toxicity outcomes. Primary outcome was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and secondary outcome was death. RESULTS: The search yielded 493 non-duplicate citations. Eighteen studies of 10 inhibitors met inclusion criteria (total N = 1005 patients). Two-thirds of included studies did not define DLTs and the reporting of toxicities was highly variable. The most commonly reported DLTs were cytopenias, gastrointestinal toxicity, metabolic disturbances, fatigue and cardiovascular toxicity; there was one death attributed to treatment toxicity. CONCLUSION: MDM2 antagonists have been studied in a variety of malignancies with toxicities similar to other commonly used chemotherapy agents and may represent a safe adjuvant treatment for further study in in acute leukemia.","['Pi, L', 'Rooprai, J', 'Allan, D S', 'Atkins, H', 'Bredeson, C', 'Fulcher, A J', 'Ito, C', 'Ramsay, T', 'Shorr', 'Stanford, W L', 'Sabloff, M', 'Christou, G']","['Pi L', 'Rooprai J', 'Allan DS', 'Atkins H', 'Bredeson C', 'Fulcher AJ', 'Ito C', 'Ramsay T', 'Shorr', 'Stanford WL', 'Sabloff M', 'Christou G']",,"['Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #3206, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Learning Services, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #3206, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Rd #2044, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.

We found that HSP70 expression in leukomonocytes from ALL patients was increased compared with the control group. HSP70 expression in NALM-6 and BE-13 was also up-regulated contrast with AHH-1. Inhibition of HSP70 significantly promoted cell apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation in ALL cell lines. Suppression of HSP70 decreased TAK1 and increased Egr-1 protein expression. Further experiments indicated that overexpression of TAK1 ameliorated the effect of HSP70 inhibition on Egr-1 protein expression, cell apoptosis and proliferation. In order to determine whether the effect of HSP70 inhibition on apoptosis and proliferation of ALL cell lines could be achieved via regulation of Egr-1, we performed a loss-of-function experiment for Egr-1. Egr-1 suppression was found to reverse the effect of HSP70 inhibition on cell apoptosis and proliferation in ALL. Taken together, our results suggest that HSP70 inhibition upregulates Egr-1 via TAK1, inducing apoptosis and restricting proliferation in ALL cells.","['Guo, Dongfang', 'Zhang, Airong', 'Huang, Jing', 'Suo, Meifang', 'Zhong, Yaping', 'Liang, Yile']","['Guo D', 'Zhang A', 'Huang J', 'Suo M', 'Zhong Y', 'Liang Y']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhumadian Central Hospital, Zhumadian, 463100, China.

OBJECTIVES: Following the initial report of aspergillosis diagnosed shortly after beginning ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a survey was developed to seek additional cases of IFD during ibrutinib treatment. METHODS: Local and international physicians and groups were approached for relevant cases. Patients were included if they met the following criteria: diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma; proven or probable IFD; and ibrutinib treatment on the date IFD were diagnosed. Clinical and laboratory data were captured using REDCap software. RESULT: Thirty-five patients with IFD were reported from 22 centres in eight countries: 26 (74%) had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median duration of ibrutinib treatment before the onset of IFD was 45 days (range 1-540). Aspergillus species were identified in 22 (63%) of the patients and Cryptococcus species in 9 (26%). Pulmonary involvement occurred in 69% of patients, cranial in 60% and disseminated disease in 60%. A definite diagnosis was made in 21 patients (69%), and the mortality rate was 69%. Data from Israel regarding ibrutinib treated patients were used to evaluate a prevalence of 2.4% IFD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IFD among chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with ibrutinib appears to be higher than expected. These patients often present with unusual clinical features. Mortality from IFD in this study was high, indicating that additional studies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk for ibrutinib-associated IFD.","['Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Ben-Ami, Ronen', 'Bar-Meir, Maskit', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Malphettes, Marion', 'Mous, Rogier', 'Tonino, Sanne H', 'Soussain, Carole', 'Barzic, Noelie', 'Messina, Julia A', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Cohen, Regev', 'Hill, Brian', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Nijland, Marcel', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Benjamini, Ohad', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Okamoto, Koh', 'Arthurs, Benjamin', 'Gottesman, Batsheva', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Talha, Munir', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Korem, Maya', 'Bogot, Naama', 'De Boer, Fransien', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Lachish, Tamar']","['Ruchlemer R', 'Ben-Ami R', 'Bar-Meir M', 'Brown JR', 'Malphettes M', 'Mous R', 'Tonino SH', 'Soussain C', 'Barzic N', 'Messina JA', 'Jain P', 'Cohen R', 'Hill B', 'Mulligan SP', 'Nijland M', 'Herishanu Y', 'Benjamini O', 'Tadmor T', 'Okamoto K', 'Arthurs B', 'Gottesman B', 'Kater AP', 'Talha M', 'Eichhorst B', 'Korem M', 'Bogot N', 'De Boer F', 'Rowe JM', 'Lachish T']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6717-1697'],"['Department of Hematology, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, affiliated with the Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, affiliated with the Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'UMC Cancer Center, Hematologie, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Institut Curie-Site de Saint-Cloud, Hematologie, Saint-Cloud, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Laniado Hospital, Netanya, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Royal North Shore Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Rush University Medical Center, affiliated with the University of Tokyo Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA, Japan.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Leeds Teaching Hospitals, NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'The Infectious Diseases Unit, Hadassah Medical Center, affiliated with Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'CT Institute, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, affiliated with Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Ikazia Hospital Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, affiliated with Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20191022,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus species', 'CLL', 'CNS', 'Cryptococcus species', 'Ibrutinib', 'NHL', 'immune-compromised host', 'invasive fungal diseases']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.13001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2019 Dec;62(12):1140-1147. doi: 10.1111/myc.13001.

Activating missense mutations in the Negative Regulatory Region (NRR) of the ectodomain of LIN-12/Notch were first described in C. elegans, and similar mutations in human Notch were later found to cause T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The ubiquitin ligase sel-10 /Fbw7 is the prototype of a conserved negative regulator of lin-12 /Notch that was first defined by loss-of-function mutations that enhance lin-12 NRR-missense activity in C. elegans, and then demonstrated to regulate Notch activity in mammalian cells and to be a bona fide tumor suppressor in T-ALL. Here, we report the results of an RNAi screen of 248 C. elegans protein kinase-encoding genes with human orthologs for enhancement of a weakly activating NRR-missense mutation of lin-12 in the Vulval Precursor Cells. We identified, and validated, thirteen kinase genes whose loss led to increase lin-12 activity; eleven of these genes have never been implicated previously in regulating Notch activity in any system. Depleting the activity of five kinase genes (cdk-8, wnk-1, kin-3, hpo-11, and mig-15) also significantly enhanced the activity of a transgene in which heterologous sequences drive expression of the untethered intracellular domain of LIN-12, suggesting that they increase the activity or stability of the signal-transducing form of LIN-12/Notch. Precedents set by other regulators of lin-12 /Notch defined through genetic interactions in C. elegans suggest that this new set of genes may include negative regulators that are functionally relevant to mammalian development and cancer.","['Deng, Yuting', 'Luo, Katherine Leisan', 'Shaye, Daniel D', 'Greenwald, Iva']","['Deng Y', 'Luo KL', 'Shaye DD', 'Greenwald I']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3962-6903'],"['Dept. of Biological Sciences and.', 'Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biophysical Studies, Columbia University, NY 10027.', 'Dept. of Biological Sciences and.', 'Dept. of Biological Sciences and isg4@columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM114140/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM131746/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA236516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P40 OD010440/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191105,England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,PMC6829150,['NOTNLM'],"['*C. elegans', '*LIN-12', '*Notch', '*hpo-11', '*kin-3', '*kinase', '*mig-15', '*negative regulator', '*wnk-1']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['g3.119.400471 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.119.400471 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2019 Nov 5;9(11):3567-3574. doi: 10.1534/g3.119.400471.,20200406,3567-3574,['Copyright (c) 2019 Deng et al.'],"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Lin-12 protein, C elegans)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (SEL-10 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (lin-15B protein, C elegans)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/*metabolism', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Vulva/cytology/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate a role for aberrant chromatin accessibility in the regulation of MYC expression in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Central to this process, the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer (N-Me), a long-range T cell-specific MYC enhancer, shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during T-cell specification and maturation and an aberrant high degree of chromatin accessibility in mouse and human T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that GATA3-driven nucleosome eviction dynamically modulates N-Me enhancer activity and is strictly required for NOTCH1-induced T-ALL initiation and maintenance. These results directly implicate aberrant regulation of chromatin accessibility at oncogenic enhancers as a mechanism of leukemic transformation. SIGNIFICANCE: MYC is a major effector of NOTCH1 oncogenic programs in T-ALL. Here, we show a major role for GATA3-mediated enhancer nucleosome eviction as a driver of MYC expression and leukemic transformation. These results support the role of aberrant chromatin accessibility and consequent oncogenic MYC enhancer activation in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1631.","['Belver, Laura', 'Yang, Alexander Y', 'Albero, Robert', 'Herranz, Daniel', 'Brundu, Francesco G', 'Quinn, S Aidan', 'Perez-Duran, Pablo', 'Alvarez, Silvia', 'Gianni, Francesca', 'Rashkovan, Marissa', 'Gurung, Devya', 'Rocha, Pedro P', 'Raviram, Ramya', 'Reglero, Clara', 'Cortes, Jose R', 'Cooke, Anisha J', 'Wendorff, Agnieszka A', 'Cordo, Valentina', 'Meijerink, Jules P', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Belver L', 'Yang AY', 'Albero R', 'Herranz D', 'Brundu FG', 'Quinn SA', 'Perez-Duran P', 'Alvarez S', 'Gianni F', 'Rashkovan M', 'Gurung D', 'Rocha PP', 'Raviram R', 'Reglero C', 'Cortes JR', 'Cooke AJ', 'Wendorff AA', 'Cordo V', 'Meijerink JP', 'Rabadan R', 'Ferrando AA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7493-7072', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1768-5969', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2133-1426', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1373-513X']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Division of Developmental Biology, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, California.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York. af2196@columbia.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['R35 CA210065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA197869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM117591/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA193313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA185486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA209997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA197869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20190913,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,PMC6891196,,,2019/09/15 06:00,2020/08/08 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-19-0471 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0471 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2019 Dec;9(12):1774-1791. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0471.

While repression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling has been shown to promote short-term maintenance of primitive AML cells in culture, no work to date has examined whether altered AHR signaling plays a pathologic role in human AML or whether it contributes at all to endogenous LSC function. Here, we show AHR signaling is repressed in human AML blasts and preferentially downregulated in LSC-enriched populations within leukemias. A core set of AHR targets are uniquely repressed in LSCs across diverse genetic AML subtypes. In vitro and in vivo administration of the specific AHR agonist FICZ significantly impaired leukemic growth, promoted differentiation, and repressed self-renewal. Furthermore, LSCs suppressed a set of FICZ-responsive AHR target genes that function as tumor suppressors and promoters of differentiation. FICZ stimulation did not impair normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) function, and failed to upregulate a prominent LSC-specific AHR target in HSPCs, suggesting that differential mechanisms govern FICZ-induced AHR signaling manifestations in HSCs versus LSCs. Altogether, this work highlights AHR signaling suppression as a key LSC-regulating control mechanism and provides proof of concept in a preclinical model that FICZ-mediated AHR pathway activation enacts unique transcriptional programs in AML that identify it as a novel chemotherapeutic approach to selectively target human LSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: The AHR pathway is suppressed in leukemic stem cells (LSC), therefore activating AHR signaling is a potential therapeutic option to target LSCs and to treat acute myeloid leukemia.","['Ly, Michelle', 'Rentas, Stefan', 'Vujovic, Ana', 'Wong, Nicholas', 'Moreira, Steven', 'Xu, Joshua', 'Holzapfel, Nicholas', 'Bhatia, Sonam', 'Tran, Damian', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Draper, Jonathan S', 'Hope, Kristin J']","['Ly M', 'Rentas S', 'Vujovic A', 'Wong N', 'Moreira S', 'Xu J', 'Holzapfel N', 'Bhatia S', 'Tran D', 'Minden MD', 'Draper JS', 'Hope KJ']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3189-7899', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3350-2093']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. kristin@mcmaster.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190913,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,,,2019/09/15 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-19-0274 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0274 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Nov 15;79(22):5799-5811. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0274.

In addition, overrepresentation of a high hyperdiploid subtype and older age at diagnosis have been reported among sporadic BCP-ALL cases with germline variants in ETV6 We studied a family with 2 second-degree relatives who developed childhood high hyperdiploid BCP-ALL at ages 8 and 12 years, respectively. A constitutional balanced reciprocal translocation t(12;14)(p13.2;q23.1) was discovered in both patients by routine karyotyping at diagnosis and, subsequently, in 7 healthy family members who had not experienced hematological malignancies. No carriers had thrombocytopenia. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the translocation, resulting in 2 actively transcribed but nonfunctional fusion genes, causing heterozygous loss and consequently monoallelic expression of ETV6 Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the affected female subjects' leukemia excluded additional somatic aberrations in ETV6 and RTN1 as well as shared somatic variants in other genes. Expression studies, performed to confirm decreased expression of ETV6, were not conclusive.

We hypothesized that improvement has been obtained with the time-dependent therapeutic era and rise in the gross domestic product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 710 children who were treated for ALL between 1958 and 2018 at a single pediatric center were analyzed for probability of 5-year overall survival (pOS), event-free survival (pEFS) and relapse risk (pRR). Time periods were defined by the treatment protocols used in seven consecutive therapeutic eras. RESULTS: Over the 60-year period analyzed, pOS increased from 1.2% to 90.7%, pEFS from 1.2% to 86.6%, and pRR decreased from 98.8% to 9.9% for patients treated in the past decade. Risk of mortality for patients who received chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant was reduced to 9.9% in the recent era, however, no statistically significant survival difference was found between patients treated with stem cell transplant and those not. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic era, related to improved GDP and HDI, was a statistically significant predictor of increased OS from ALL.","['Demidowicz, Ewa', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Lecka, Monika', 'Zolnowska, Hanna', 'Marjanska, Agata', 'Kubicka, Malgorzata', 'Kurylo-Rafinska, Beata', 'Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Debski, Robert', 'Koltan, Andrzej', 'Richert-Przygonska, Monika', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Demidowicz E', 'Pogorzala M', 'Lecka M', 'Zolnowska H', 'Marjanska A', 'Kubicka M', 'Kurylo-Rafinska B', 'Czyzewski K', 'Debski R', 'Koltan A', 'Richert-Przygonska M', 'Styczynski J']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland jstyczynski@cm.umk.pl.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Human Development Index', 'children', 'gross domestic product', 'survival', 'therapeutic era']",2019/09/15 06:00,2019/09/27 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['39/9/5203 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13717 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Sep;39(9):5203-5207. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13717.,20190926,5203-5207,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, our aim was to identify an ideal target of leukemic cell growth for developing inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210, human Toledo cells and a DBA/2 mouse graft model were used to analyze the activity of dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014s. Western blotting and flow cytometry were performed to determine the mechanism. RESULTS: AZD2014 inhibited L1210 and human Toledo cell proliferation. Treatment with AZD2014 reduced the phosphorylation levels of S6K1 and 4EBP1 and the protein levels of Rictor, a component of the mTORC2 pathway. AZD2014 induced cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase by reducing the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4. Oral administration of AZD2014 significantly inhibited the growth of L1210 cell grafts in DBA/2 mice. CONCLUSION: The mTORC1/2 inhibitor may be a better therapeutic agent compared to PI3K/mTORC1 inhibitors for treating patients with CLL.","['Liao, Hui-Fen', 'Lin, You-Zhu', 'Yu, Chih-Chia', 'Tai, Tzong-Shyuan', 'Hung, Shih-Kai', 'Yang, Ching-Chieh', 'Su, Yu-Chieh']","['Liao HF', 'Lin YZ', 'Yu CC', 'Tai TS', 'Hung SK', 'Yang CC', 'Su YC']",,"['Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Medical Research, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C. hepatoma@gmail.com cleanclear0905@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C. hepatoma@gmail.com cleanclear0905@gmail.com.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,['NOTNLM'],"['AZD2014', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'mTORC1/2', 'mammalian target of rapamycin']",2019/09/15 06:00,2019/09/27 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['39/9/4829 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13668 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Sep;39(9):4829-4835. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13668.,20190926,4829-4835,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0BSC3P4H5X (vistusertib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell-surface markers, cytokine production, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were examined in cells from spleen and peritoneal lavage fluid. RESULTS: Metformin-treated mice exhibited suppressed intraperitoneal tumor growth and extended survival, and these effects were lost in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. MDSCs induction was inhibited in metformin-treated mice. Although MDSC mobilization into the peritoneal cavity was correlated with suppression of interferon-gamma production by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the T-helper 1 ability of these lymphocytes was preserved in metformin-treated mice.

Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., a replacement of the cellular components of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g., at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly. RESULTS: In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) high concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and B cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state. CONCLUSIONS: We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution, and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.","['Ingham, Anna Cacilia', 'Kielsen, Katrine', 'Cilieborg, Malene Skovsted', 'Lund, Ole', 'Holmes, Susan', 'Aarestrup, Frank M', 'Muller, Klaus Gottlob', 'Pamp, Sunje Johanna']","['Ingham AC', 'Kielsen K', 'Cilieborg MS', 'Lund O', 'Holmes S', 'Aarestrup FM', 'Muller KG', 'Pamp SJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6236-1763'],"['Research Group for Genomic Epidemiology, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute for Inflammation Research, Department of Rheumatology and Spine Disease, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Comparative Pediatrics and Nutrition, Department of Clinical Veterinary and Animal Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.', 'Department of Bio and Health Informatics, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, USA.', 'Research Group for Genomic Epidemiology, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Institute for Inflammation Research, Department of Rheumatology and Spine Disease, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Research Group for Genomic Epidemiology, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark. sjpa@food.dtu.dk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190913,England,Microbiome,Microbiome,101615147,PMC6744702,['NOTNLM'],"['*16S rRNA gene profiling', '*B cells and NK cells', '*Data integration', '*Gut microbiota', '*HSCT', '*Human beta-defensin 2', '*Immune reconstitution', '*Pediatric cancer', '*Ruminococcaceae', '*acute GvHD']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40168-019-0745-z [doi]', '10.1186/s40168-019-0745-z [pii]']",epublish,Microbiome. 2019 Sep 13;7(1):131. doi: 10.1186/s40168-019-0745-z.,20200526,131,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lactobacillaceae/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the potential mechanism for the regulation of trophoblast behaviors and the pathogenesis of PE remain largely elusive. Recently, accumulating evidence emphasized that aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) functions as imperative regulators in human diseases, including PE. Thus, identifying PE-related specific lncRNAs to uncover the underlying molecular mechanism is of much significance. However, the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs in PE progression remain unclear. METHOD: Placenta tissues obtained from patients with PE and healthy pregnant women were performed to measure TUG1 expression by qRT-PCR analysis. Transient transfections were conducted to alter TUG1 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays were carried out to assess cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Transwell and tube formation assays were performed to measure the capacity of cell invasion and angiogenesis. Moreover, the luciferase reporter assay was subjected to verify the binding relationship between TUG1 and miR-29b. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of key proteins in the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathway. RESULTS: Here, we identified a lncRNA, TUG1, which was notably decreased in placental samples of PE patients. Functional experiments of loss- or gain-of-function assays also verified that ectopic expression of TUG1 promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis, but negatively regulated cell apoptosis, whereas TUG1 inhibition presented the opposite effects. Furthermore, mechanistic researches revealed that TUG1 could act as a molecular sponge for miR-29b, thus regulating MCL1, VEGFA, and MMP2 to modulate PE development. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings demonstrated that TUG1 exerts as a critical role in PE progression, which might furnish a novel therapeutic marker for PE treatment.","['Li, Qian', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Su, Dong-Mei', 'Guan, Li-Na', 'Mu, Wei-Hong', 'Yu, Mei', 'Ma, Xu', 'Yang, Rong-Juan']","['Li Q', 'Zhang J', 'Su DM', 'Guan LN', 'Mu WH', 'Yu M', 'Ma X', 'Yang RJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4860-3084'],"[""National Human Genetic Resources Center, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, 100081, People's Republic of China."", ""Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050011, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Genetic Center, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, 100081, People's Republic of China."", ""Genetic Center, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, 100081, People's Republic of China."", ""Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050011, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050011, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Genetic Center, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, 100081, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, No. 206, East Zhongshan Road, Shijiazhuang, 050011, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China. chgr2013@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['No. C201606055/Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province/International', 'No. 31871391/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190913,England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,PMC6743181,['NOTNLM'],"['*MCL1', '*MMP2', '*Pre-eclampsia', '*VEGFA', '*lncRNA TUG1', '*miR-29b']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40246-019-0237-z [doi]', '10.1186/s40246-019-0237-z [pii]']",epublish,Hum Genomics. 2019 Sep 13;13(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s40246-019-0237-z.,20200317,50,,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/pathology', 'Placenta/metabolism/pathology', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*genetics/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Trophoblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Iron promotes cell growth and proliferation, but it also causes oxidative stress damage. The body has a strict regulation mechanism of iron metabolism due to its potential toxicity. As a cancer of the bone marrow and blood cells, leukemia threatens human health seriously. Current studies suggest that dysregulation of iron metabolism and subsequent accumulation of excess iron are closely associated with the occurrence and progress of leukemia. Specifically, excess iron promotes the development of leukemia due to the pro-oxidative nature of iron and its damaging effects on DNA. On the other hand, leukemia cells acquire large amounts of iron to maintain rapid growth and proliferation. Therefore, targeting iron metabolism may provide new insights for approaches to the treatment of leukemia. This review summarizes physiologic iron metabolism, alternations of iron metabolism in leukemia and therapeutic opportunities of targeting the altered iron metabolism in leukemia, with a focus on acute leukemia.","['Wang, Fang', 'Lv, Huanhuan', 'Zhao, Bin', 'Zhou, Liangfu', 'Wang, Shenghang', 'Luo, Jie', 'Liu, Junyu', 'Shang, Peng']","['Wang F', 'Lv H', 'Zhao B', 'Zhou L', 'Wang S', 'Luo J', 'Liu J', 'Shang P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5418-6240'],"[""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", ""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", 'Research & Development Institute of Northwestern Polytechnical University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518057, China.', ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, Institute of Special Environment Biophysics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", ""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", ""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", ""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", ""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", ""School of Life Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China."", 'Research & Development Institute of Northwestern Polytechnical University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518057, China. shangpeng@nwpu.edu.cn.', ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, Institute of Special Environment Biophysics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China. shangpeng@nwpu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['51777171/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81803032/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '3102017OQD111/the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities', '3102018JGC012/the Northwestern Polytechnical University Foundation for', 'Fundamental Research', 'JCYJ20170412140904406/Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen of', 'China']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190913,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC6743129,['NOTNLM'],"['Ferroptosis', 'Iron', 'Iron-based nanoparticles', 'Leukemia', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-019-1397-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-019-1397-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Sep 13;38(1):406. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1397-3.,20200211,406,,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Iron/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases where a functional RNA structure is within the coding sequence a selective pressure drives a parallel co-evolution of the RNA structure and the encoded peptide domain. The p53-MDM2 axis, describing the interactions between the p53 tumor suppressor and the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, serves as particularly useful model revealing how secondary RNA structures have co-evolved along with corresponding interacting protein motifs, thus having an impact on protein - RNA and protein - protein interactions; and how such structures developed signal-dependent regulation in mammalian systems. The p53(BOX-I) RNA sequence binds the C-terminus of MDM2 and controls p53 synthesis while the encoded peptide domain binds MDM2 and controls p53 degradation. The BOX-I peptide domain is also located within p53 transcription activation domain. The folding of the p53 mRNA structure has evolved from temperature-regulated in pre-vertebrates to an ATM kinase signal-dependent pathway in mammalian cells. The protein - protein interaction evolved in vertebrates and became regulated by the same signaling pathway. At the same time the protein - RNA and protein - protein interactions evolved, the p53 trans-activation domain progressed to become integrated into a range of cellular pathways. We discuss how a single synonymous mutation in the BOX-1, the p53(L22 L), observed in a chronic lymphocyte leukaemia patient, prevents the activation of p53 following DNA damage. The concepts analysed and discussed in this review may serve as a conceptual mechanistic paradigm of the co-evolution and function of molecules having roles in cellular regulation, or the aetiology of genetic diseases and how synonymous mutations can affect the encoded protein.","['Karakostis, Konstantinos', 'Fahraeus, Robin']","['Karakostis K', 'Fahraeus R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1122-7860'],"['Universite Paris 7, INSERM UMR 1131, 27 Rue Juliette Dodu, 75010, Paris, France. chem898@yahoo.gr.', 'Universite Paris 7, INSERM UMR 1131, 27 Rue Juliette Dodu, 75010, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, SE-90185, Umea, Sweden.', 'RECAMO, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Zluty kopec 7, 656 53, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190913,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6743176,['NOTNLM'],"['Ciona intestinalis', 'Intrinsically disordered proteins', 'Molecular basis of disease', 'Protein-RNA interactions', 'RNA world', 'Transcription factor', 'mRNA translation']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6118-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6118-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Sep 13;19(1):915. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6118-y.,20200211,915,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Exhaustion of CD8(+) T-cells is characterized by increased expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1, decreased proliferation, and reduced effector function such as cytokine production, which reduces anti-tumor control. Despite the accumulation of exhausted PD-1(+) CD8(+) T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs of CLL patients, immune checkpoint blockade as a means to reinvigorate anti-tumor T-cell activity has not shown the expected efficacy. This highlights the need for a better understanding of T-cell exhaustion in CLL. Here, we uncover the transcriptional program of T-cell exhaustion in CLL by comparing naive with dysfunctional effector CD8(+) T-cells with high PD-1 expression from mice after adoptive transfer of Emicro-TCL1 leukemic cells. Our data provide clear evidence for activation-induced dysfunction of CD8(+) T-cells in the CLL microenvironment and assess the heterogeneity in the expression of functionally relevant proteins in specific clusters of CD8(+) T-cells at a single-cell level.","['Llao Cid, Laura', 'Hanna, Bola S', 'Iskar, Murat', 'Roessner, Philipp M', 'Ozturk, Selcen', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Zapatka, Marc', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Llao Cid L', 'Hanna BS', 'Iskar M', 'Roessner PM', 'Ozturk S', 'Lichter P', 'Zapatka M', 'Seiffert M']",,"['Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190913,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8+ T-cells', '*CLL', '*T-cell exhaustion', '*single-cell analyses']",2019/09/15 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1660972 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Feb;61(2):351-356. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1660972.

The 3-year probability of relapse was 7.6% and 16.7% for the standard- and high-risk group (p = .274).

Children with hypodiploid ALL have poor outcomes despite current intensive chemotherapy. Little has been investigated with regard to hypodiploid ALL in Japanese children. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data on hypodiploid ALL cases from the registries of prospective multicenter trials conducted by the four independent clinical study groups in Japan between 1997 and 2012. RESULTS: A total of 117 ALL patients with hypodiploidy were analyzed in this study. There were 101, eight, and eight patients with 45, 44, and fewer than 44 chromosomes, respectively. The 5 year overall survival rates differed significantly: 86.0%, 87.5%, and 62.5% for patients with 45, 44, and fewer than 44 chromosomes, respectively (P = 0.037). Of the eight patients with 44 chromosomes, seven were alive, including five patients who maintained complete remission without undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Of the eight patients with fewer than 44 chromosomes, six were good responders to prednisolone and none had induction failure, but the relapse rate was high (5/8). No patients had central nervous system relapse. Four patients underwent HSCT after relapse, but only one survived. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of Japanese ALL patients with fewer than 44 chromosomes were poor, as previously reported in other countries. Although the sample size was small, patients with 44 chromosomes had better prognoses than those previously reported. Further studies including international collaboration are needed to improve outcomes for pediatric ALL patients with fewer than 44 chromosomes.","['Ishimaru, Sae', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Imai, Chihaya', 'Sakaguchi, Hirotoshi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Kakuda, Harumi', 'Sano, Hideki', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Arakawa, Yuki', 'Shimonodan, Hidemi', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Suenobu, Souichi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Watanabe, Arata', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi', 'Kikuta, Atsushi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Ohara, Akira', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi']","['Ishimaru S', 'Okamoto Y', 'Imai C', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Taki T', 'Hasegawa D', 'Cho Y', 'Kakuda H', 'Sano H', 'Manabe A', 'Imamura T', 'Kato M', 'Arakawa Y', 'Shimonodan H', 'Sato A', 'Suenobu S', 'Inukai T', 'Watanabe A', 'Kawano Y', 'Kikuta A', 'Horibe K', 'Ohara A', 'Koh K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5437-8821', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9446-9568', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5145-1774']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross, Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Department of Medical Technology, Kyorin University Faculty of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Departments of Pediatrics, St Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chiba Children's Hospital, Chiba, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', ""Departments of Pediatrics, St Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Sendai, Japan."", 'Division of General Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Oita University, Faculty of Medicine, Yufu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nakadori General Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Toho University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20191121,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'child', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'hypodiploid']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.14006 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2019 Nov;61(11):1103-1108. doi: 10.1111/ped.14006.

However, due to primary resistance or secondary resistance caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain, TKIs cannot completely prevent the progression of CML; thus, the study of BCR-ABL1 gene expression regulation is of great significance. In this study, bioinformatics analysis and our results showed that miR-96 could directly bind to the 3'UTR region of BCR-ABL1 to regulate fusion protein expression, thereby regulating its downstream signaling pathway activity. We also found that miR-96 was downregulated during the progression from the chronic phase (CML-CP) to the blast crisis (CML-BC). Downregulation of miR-96 could promote the proliferation and participate in the cell differentiation of CML-BC cells. Additionally, we found that the novel histone deacetylase drug chidamide and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine could restore the low expression of miR-96 in CML cells, and there were two abnormal hypermethylated sites in the promoter region of miR-96 in CML, suggesting that its low expression might be at least partially regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, re-expression of miR-96 could increase the sensitivity of CML-BC cells to imatinib. Thus, miR-96 functions as a tumor suppressor, and re-expression of this microRNA might have therapeutic benefits in CML blastic transformation.","['Huang, Tao', 'Fu, Yue', 'Wang, Siqi', 'Xu, Man', 'Yin, Xiaolin', 'Zhou, Minran', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Huang T', 'Fu Y', 'Wang S', 'Xu M', 'Yin X', 'Zhou M', 'Wang X', 'Chen C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China; School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Immunohematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', ""Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, PR China."", 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.

Here we developed and validated a novel AML-specific disease risk group (AML-DRG) and revised our previously developed hematopoietic cell transplant-composite risk (HCT-CR) model by incorporating molecular data and MRD status to predict outcomes of patients with AML. The study included 1414 consecutively treated adult AML patients who received a first AHCT. Patients were randomly assigned into training (n=944) and validation (n=470) sets. To develop the AML-DRG model, the coefficient of all significant AML-related variables in multivariable Cox regression analysis in a training dataset was converted into scores, whereas the AML-HCT-CR was the sum of disease-related factors assessed by the AML-DRG model with the addition of weighted scores from patient-related factors. The AML-DRG was developed by assigning the following scores: 1 point to secondary AML, 1 point to the European LeukaemiaNet adverse genetic risk, 2 points to complete remission with MRD positive/unknown, and 4 points to active disease. These scores were used to generate 3 risk groups of the AML-DRG with significantly different overall survivals. By adding the score for significant patient-related factors (HCT-specific comorbidity index/age), we created 4 risk groups of AML-HCT-CR with distinct survival outcomes. Both the AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR provided significantly better discriminative capacity compared with the disease risk index, European LeukaemiaNet genetic risk model, and cytogenetic risk model. Prognostic models incorporating molecular data and MRD status allow better stratification and improved survival estimates of AML patients post-transplant.","['Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Hasan, Omar', 'Perez, Jorge Miguel Ramos', 'Varma, Ankur', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Srour, Samer', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar', 'Mehta, Rohtesh', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Khouri, Issa', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Popat, Uday', 'Champlin, Richard R', 'Ciurea, Stefan O']","['Kongtim P', 'Hasan O', 'Perez JMR', 'Varma A', 'Wang SA', 'Patel KP', 'Chen J', 'Rondon G', 'Srour S', 'Bashir Q', 'Qazilbash M', 'Mehta R', 'Shpall EJ', 'Alousi A', 'Khouri I', 'Kebriaei P', 'Popat U', 'Champlin RR', 'Ciurea SO']",,"['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; Center of Excellence in Applied Epidemiology, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand; Department of Medicine Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as important regulators for the development of PC and participate in the progression of PC. miR-129-5p was reported to regulate the progression of tumors, such as thyroid cancer and gastric cancer. However, the function of miR-129-5p in PC is still unclear. In this study, the down-regulation of miR-129-5p was detected in PC tissues and PC cells. miR-129-5p was overexpressed or knocked down in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The results showed that miR-129-5p overexpression suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis of PC cells, whereas miR-129-5p knockdown showed opposite effects. In addition, we found that pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) overexpression promoted proliferation, migration and invasion, but reduced apoptosis of PC cells. PBX3 was identified as a target of miR-129-5p by informatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay. Finally, our results indicated that miR-129-5p suppressed cell proliferation and migration by targeting PBX3. This study demonstrated that miR-129-5p could function as a tumor suppressor in the progression and development of PC by targeting PBX3, providing a reliable prognostic factor and a new therapeutic strategy for PC.","['Qiu, Zhisheng', 'Wang, Xiaochun', 'Shi, Yuping', 'Da, Mingxu']","['Qiu Z', 'Wang X', 'Shi Y', 'Da M']",,"['Department of Surgical Oncology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou 730000, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,,['NOTNLM'],"['PBX3', 'miR-129-5p', 'migration', 'pancreatic cancer', 'proliferation']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['5568682 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmz096 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2019 Sep 6;51(10):997-1007. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmz096.,20200205,997-1007,"['The Author(s) 2019.

METHODS: The CXCR4 expression by flow cytometry in 122 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients between 2010 and 2014 was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of CXCR4 in AML-M4/M5 was found to be significantly higher than that of other subtypes according to both FAB subtype and WHO classification. The FLT3-ITD mutant was significantly higher in high CXCR4 expression group (P = .0086). Our data also showed that CXCR4 expression was correlated with CD64 expression. Low CXCR4 expression on AML cells was associated with better prognosis, and the median overall survival (OS) for low CXCR4 expression patients was 318 days, compared with 206 days for patients with high CXCR4 expression (P = .045). Multivariate analysis revealed that CXCR4 expression, age, and extramedullary infiltration were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that CXCR4 expression in AML was an independent prognostic predictor for disease survival that could be rapidly and easily determined by flow cytometry at disease presentation.","['Du, Wen', 'Lu, Cong', 'Zhu, Xinyun', 'Hu, Dong', 'Chen, Xiangjun', 'Li, Juan', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'He, Yanli', 'Yao, Junxia']","['Du W', 'Lu C', 'Zhu X', 'Hu D', 'Chen X', 'Li J', 'Liu W', 'Zhu J', 'He Y', 'Yao J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8909-0852'],"['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Neonatal Screening Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['2018CFB485/Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81201552/National Natural Science Foundation, P.R China/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190913,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6825984,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CXCR4', '*FLT3-ITD mutant', '*clinical characteristics']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2535 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Nov;8(15):6595-6603. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2535.

This, coupled with advanced analysis methodologies, supports a developing need for techniques that could identify the presence of cancer cells in cytology and tissue samples in an objective, fast, and automated way. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy can identify cancer cells in such samples objectively. Thus, it has the potential to become another tool to help pathologists in their daily work. However, one of the main drawbacks is the use of glass substrates by pathologists. Glass absorbs IR radiation, removing important mid-IR spectral data in the fingerprint region (1800 cm(-1) to 900 cm(-1)). In this work, we hypothesized that, using glass coverslips of differing compositions, some regions within the fingerprint area could still be analyzed. We studied three different types of cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a leukemia cell line, and a lung cancer cell line) and lymph node tissue placed on four different types of glass coverslips. The data presented here show that depending of the type of glass substrate used, information within the fingerprint region down to 1350 cm(-1) can be obtained. Furthermore, using principal component analysis, separation between the different cell lines was possible using both the lipid region and the fingerprint region between 1800 cm(-1) and 1350 cm(-1). This work represents a further step towards the application of FT-IR microspectroscopy in histopathology departments.","['Rutter, Abigail V', 'Crees, Jamie', 'Wright, Helen', 'Raseta, Marko', 'van Pittius, Daniel G', 'Roach, Paul', 'Sule-Suso, Josep']","['Rutter AV', 'Crees J', 'Wright H', 'Raseta M', 'van Pittius DG', 'Roach P', 'Sule-Suso J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0598-737X'],"['Guy Hilton Research Centre, Keele University, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Histopathology Department, Royal Derby Hospital, Derby, UK.', 'Directorate of Research, Innovation and Engagement, Keele University, Staffordshire, UK.', 'Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences and Research Design Service, Keele University, Staffordshire, UK.', 'Histopathology Department, Royal Stoke University Hospital, University Hospitals of North Midlands (UHNM), Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Department of Chemistry, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK.', 'Guy Hilton Research Centre, Keele University, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Oncology Department, Royal Stoke University Hospital, University Hospitals of North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190913,United States,Appl Spectrosc,Applied spectroscopy,0372406,,['NOTNLM'],"['FT-IR microspectroscopy', 'Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy', 'glass coverslips', 'leukemia', 'lung cancer', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0003702819875828 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Spectrosc. 2020 Feb;74(2):178-186. doi: 10.1177/0003702819875828.

These findings suggest that chromatin accessibility and DNA damage generation at the BCR3 due to treatment with etoposide, is independent of RUNX1 gene expression.","['Schnake, Nicolas', 'Gutierrez, Soraya']","['Schnake N', 'Gutierrez S']",,"['Laboratory of Epigenetics [EpiGene], Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Laboratory of Epigenetics [EpiGene], Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190827,Netherlands,Leuk Res Rep,Leukemia research reports,101608906,PMC6731348,['NOTNLM'],"['Breakpoint cluster region', 'Etoposide', 'RUNX1']",2019/09/14 06:00,2019/09/14 06:01,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.lrr.2019.100182 [doi]', 'S2213-0489(19)30045-7 [pii]', '100182 [pii]']",epublish,Leuk Res Rep. 2019 Aug 27;12:100182. doi: 10.1016/j.lrr.2019.100182. eCollection 2019.,,100182,,,,,['The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Molecularly, PV is more homogenous, being driven by JAK2 mutations in virtually all cases, while ET can be JAK2-, CALR-, or MPL-mutated, as well as 'triple negative'. Recent targeted next-generation sequencing efforts have identified other, nondriver gene mutations, some with prognostic relevance. Prevention of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications continues to be the major focus of management, although symptoms are increasingly being recognized as a relatively unmet need, particularly in ET. Thrombotic risk stratification in PV is still based on age and history of thrombosis, while in ET, the additional contribution of JAK2 V617F to thrombotic risk is now well established. The associations of leukocytosis with clotting risk (in both conditions) and mortality (in PV) have drawn increased attention with the availability of ruxolitinib as a second-line treatment in PV. Similarly, there is a renewed interest in interferons with the emergence of ropeginterferon alfa-2b as a potential new frontline treatment option in PV. Drug development is more difficult in ET, the most indolent of the classic Ph(-) MPNs, but ruxolitinib is being studied. Triggering apoptosis via the p53 pathway through pharmacologic inhibition of human double minute 2 (and synergism with interferon) is a new, promising therapeutic strategy.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4343-5712'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Boulevard, FC4.3062 (Unit 428), Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190830,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC6719465,['NOTNLM'],"['essential thrombocythemia', 'leukocytosis', 'polycythemia vera', 'prognosis', 'risk stratification', 'ropeginterferon alfa-2b', 'ruxolitinib', 'symptoms']",2019/09/14 06:00,2019/09/14 06:01,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719870052 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719870052 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Aug 30;10:2040620719870052. doi: 10.1177/2040620719870052. eCollection 2019.,,2040620719870052,,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: PB reports honoraria from Incyte Corporation,', 'Celgene Corporation and Blueprint Medicines Corporation, and research funding', 'from Incyte Corporation, Celgene Corporation, CTI BioPharma, Kartos Therapeutics,', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Inc., Astellas Pharmaceuticals, NS-Pharma,', 'Promedior and Blueprint Medicines Corporation.']",,,,,,,,,,,

It has been well established that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in defining tumor size, the speed of development and the level of regression following treatment; therefore, CSCs are associated with a poor prognosis. CSCs have been detected in many types of cancer, including leukemia, pancreatic, colon, esophagus, liver, prostate, breast, gastric and lung cancer. In cervical cancer, CSCs have been associated with resistance to normally used drugs such as cisplatin.

L-asparaginase is an important therapeutic enzyme used for treating ALL. Owing to its therapeutic use and demand, microorganisms have been in use for many years to produce L-asparaginase on an industrial scale. Gram-negative bacteria (Serratia, Erwinia and Escherichia coli) species were used in L-asparaginase. However, earlier studies have documented that the long-term use of enzymes produced from these commercial strains induces hypersensitivity in patients. Therefore, there is a need to discover novel microbial strains producing L-asparaginase with anti-cancer properties, which can be employed for the commercial production of the enzyme. In this study, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (accession numbers LC425424 (P31), LC425425 (P32), and LC425426 (P34)) isolated from garden soil were screened for the invention of L-asparaginase. Fermented production media was dialyzed to attain the purified enzyme, thus showed a dose-depended cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells, as determined by MTT assay. The IC50s of the different isolates were 86.73, 57.65, and 40.34microg/mL.

The predominance of this pseudotype choice for clinical gene therapy studies is largely due to a lack of purification schemes for pseudotypes other than VSVg. In this study, we report for the first time the development of a new downstream process protocol allowing high-yield production of stable and infectious gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV)-TR-LV particles. We identified critical conditions in tangential flow filtration (TFF) and chromatographic steps for preserving the infectivity/functionality of LV during purification. This was carried out by identifying for each step, the critical parameters affecting LV infectivity, including pH, salinity, presence of stabilizers, temperature, and by defining the optimal order of these steps. A three-step process was developed for GaLV-TR-LV purification consisting of one TFF and two chromatographic steps (ion-exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography) permitting recoveries of >27% of infectious particles.

The smaller subset without KMT2A-r, which represents 20% of infant ALL cases, is poorly characterized. Here we report two cases of chemotherapy-sensitive non-KMT2A-r infant ALL. Transcriptome analyses revealed identical ACIN1-NUTM1 gene fusions in both cases, derived from cryptic chromosomal rearrangements undetected by standard cytogenetic approaches. Two isoforms of the gene fusion, joining exons 3 or 4 of ACIN1 to exon 3 of NUTM1, were identified. Both fusion transcripts contained the functional DNA-binding SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain of ACIN1 and most of NUTM1. The detection of the ACIN1-NUTM1 fusion by RT-PCR allowed the molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in a clinical setting. Based on publicly available genomic datasets and literature review, we predict that NUTM1 gene fusions are recurrent events in infant ALL. As such, we propose two clinically relevant assays to screen for NUTM1 rearrangements in bone marrow cells, independent of the fusion partner: NUMT1 immunohistochemistry and NUTM1 RNA expression. In sum, our study identifies ACIN1-NUTM1 as a recurrent and possibly cryptic fusion in non-KMT2A-r infant ALL, provides clinical tools to screen for NUTM1-rearranged leukemia and contributes to the refinement of this new subgroup.","['Pincez, Thomas', 'Landry, Josette-Renee', 'Roussy, Mathieu', 'Jouan, Loubna', 'Bilodeau, Melanie', 'Laramee, Louise', 'Couture, Francoise', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Oligny, Luc', 'Rouette, Alexandre', 'Tran, Thai H', 'Wilhelm, Brian T', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Cellot, Sonia']","['Pincez T', 'Landry JR', 'Roussy M', 'Jouan L', 'Bilodeau M', 'Laramee L', 'Couture F', 'Sinnett D', 'Gendron P', 'Hebert J', 'Oligny L', 'Rouette A', 'Tran TH', 'Wilhelm BT', 'Bittencourt H', 'Cellot S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9412-333X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5364-5924']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Streamline Genomics, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Integrated Centre for Pediatric Clinical Genomics, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Integrated Centre for Pediatric Clinical Genomics, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, IRIC, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191004,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NUTM1', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*gene fusion', '*infant leukemia', '*minimal residual disease', '*transcriptomics']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22808 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Feb;59(2):125-130. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22808.

We studied the expression of CADM1 and its splicing variants in Sezary syndrome (SS), MF, other cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and cell lines derived from T- and B-cell lymphomas. Soluble CADM1 was measured in the patients' sera. CADM1+ cells in the blood and skin lesions were examined by flow cytometry and immunostaining, respectively. Soluble CADM1 was measured by ELISA, and the splicing variants of CADM1 transcripts were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, followed by sequencing. As a result, circulating CADM1+ cells were significantly increased in seven out of 10 patients with SS, ranging from 7.9% to 74.5% of the CD3+CD4+ fractions (median 33.7%; cut-off value 6.5%). The percentages of CADM1+ cells were usually less than those of circulating Sezary cells. CADM1 was expressed, to various degrees, in six of nine T-cell lines derived from SS, MF, ATLL, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), but negative in B-cell lymphoma-derived cell lines. CADM1+ cells were present in the skin infiltrates of MF, SS, ATLL and ALCL. Serum levels of soluble CADM1 were not significantly elevated in SS/MF. Three major splicing variants of CADM1 expressed by neoplastic T-cells contained different combinations of the exons 7, 8, 9 and 11, including a putative oncogenic variant composed of exons 7-8-9-11. In conclusion, CADM1 is frequently expressed in Sezary cells and cell lines from CTCL.","['Yamaguchi, Mari', 'Morizane, Shin', 'Hamada, Toshihisa', 'Miyake, Tomoko', 'Sugaya, Makoto', 'Iwata, Hiroaki', 'Fujii, Kazuyasu', 'Haramoto-Shiratsuki, Rie', 'Nakagawa, Yuki', 'Miura, Mayumi', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Takahashi, Takahide', 'Imada, Masahide', 'Okada, Ken', 'Uehara, Jiro', 'Sowa-Osako, Junko', 'Iwatsuki, Keiji']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Morizane S', 'Hamada T', 'Miyake T', 'Sugaya M', 'Iwata H', 'Fujii K', 'Haramoto-Shiratsuki R', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Miura M', 'Ohshima K', 'Morishita K', 'Takahashi T', 'Imada M', 'Okada K', 'Uehara J', 'Sowa-Osako J', 'Iwatsuki K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-065X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4192-5707', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1618-329X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8781-2735', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6482-8953', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6457-0307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-3179']","['Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Central Clinical Laboratory, Kawasaki Medical School Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190912,England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,,['NOTNLM'],"['CADM1', 'Sezary syndrome', 'T-cell lines', 'mycosis fungoides', 'splicing variant']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.15078 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2019 Nov;46(11):967-977. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.15078.

METHODS: Targeted capture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out using a customized 49-gene panel. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), CALR, NPM1 and CEBPA mutations were detected by PCR and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (80.5%) were found to harbor at least one mutation. Each patient has carried 2.21 mutations in average. Coexistence of >/= 3 mutations was common (43.7%). The most commonly mutated genes were RUNX1 (23.4%, 18/77), ASXL1 (18.2%, 14/77), NPM1 (15.6%, 12/77), U2AF1 (15.6%, 12/77), DNMT3A (11.7%, 9/77). Patients with SF3B1 mutations were significantly older than those with ASXL1 mutations (P=0.023). Mutations of the DNMT3A gene were significantly associated with the blood platelet level compared with BCOR mutations (P=0.02). No significant difference was found in the number and rate of mutations between those under or above 60-year-old. Among 67 patients with clinical follow-up, 20 (29.8%) has transformed to acute myeloid leukemia, and the time of transformation has ranged from 1 to 44 months, with a average of 5.3 months. RUNX1, U2AF1 and FLT3 mutations are associated with leukemic transformation. CONCLUSION: Coexistence of >/= 3 mutations are frequent among patients with normal-karyotype MDS.

To date, the capacity of a positive GRR in newly diagnosed NHL patients to predict CNS relapse has not been addressed. We retrospectively studied the prognostic value of GRR in cerebrospinal fluid samples of 148 newly diagnosed patients with high grade NHL. We demonstrate that positive GRR at diagnosis does not affect PFS or OS and did not predict CNS relapse. However, although numbers were small, repeated positive samples (>/= 2) correlated with a higher risk for CNS relapse (p = 0.048), possibly stressing the need for an aggressive preventive approach.","['Nachmias, Boaz', 'Sandler, Veronica', 'Slyusarevsky, Elena', 'Pogrebijski, Galina', 'Kritchevsky, Svetlana', 'Ben-Yehuda, Dina', 'Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Gatt, Moshe E']","['Nachmias B', 'Sandler V', 'Slyusarevsky E', 'Pogrebijski G', 'Kritchevsky S', 'Ben-Yehuda D', 'Goldschmidt N', 'Gatt ME']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-2167'],"['Hematology Department, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, POB 12000, Jerusalem, Israel.

We explored multiple datasets for correlation between leukemia, body mass index (BMI) and molecular features. In a population-based study (n=5.2 million), we correlated BMI with promyelocytic leukemia, and other acute myeloid, lymphoid or other leukemias. In cross-sectional studies, we tested BMI deviation in promyelocytic leukemia trial cohorts from that expected based on national surveys. We explored The Cancer Genome Atlas for transcriptional signatures and mutations enriched in promyelocytic leukemia and/or obesity, and confirmed a correlation between body mass and FLT3 mutations in promyelocytic leukemia cohorts by logistic regression. In the population-based study, hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) increase was: promyelocytic leukemia 1.44 (95%CI: 1.0-2.08), non-promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemias 1.17 (95%CI: 1.10-1.26), lymphoid leukemias 1.04 (95%CI: 1.0-1.09), other 1.10 (95%CI: 1.04-1.15). In cross-sectional studies, body mass deviated significantly from that expected (Italy: P<0.001; Spain: P=0.011; USA: P<0.001). Promyelocytic leukemia showed upregulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism genes. Odds of FLT3 mutations were higher in obese acute myeloid leukemias (odds ratio=2.4, P=0.007), whether promyelocytic or not, a correlation confirmed in the pooled promyelocytic leukemia cohorts (OR=1.22, 1.05-1.43 per 5 kg/m(2)). These results strengthen the evidence for obesity as a bona fide risk factor for myeloid leukemias, and in particular APL. FLT3 mutations and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism may play a previously under-appreciated role in obesity-associated leukemogenesis.","['Mazzarella, Luca', 'Botteri, Edoardo', 'Matthews, Anthony', 'Gatti, Elena', 'Di Salvatore, Davide', 'Bagnardi, Vincenzo', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Bernal, Teresa', 'Gil, Cristina', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Sanz, Miguel', 'Bhaskaran, Krishnan', 'Coco, Francesco Lo', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Mazzarella L', 'Botteri E', 'Matthews A', 'Gatti E', 'Di Salvatore D', 'Bagnardi V', 'Breccia M', 'Montesinos P', 'Bernal T', 'Gil C', 'Ley TJ', 'Sanz M', 'Bhaskaran K', 'Coco FL', 'Pelicci PG']",,"['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy luca.mazzarella@ieo.it.', 'Division of Early Drug Development for Innovative Therapies, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'IFOM-FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Hospital General, Alicante, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, University Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy piergiuseppe.pelicci@ieo.it.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan.']",['eng'],"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056341/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190912,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7271575,,,2019/09/14 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.223925 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.223925 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jun;105(6):1559-1566. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.223925.

Morin, a kind of flavonoid, exhibits a significant anticancer activity by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. However, the effect of morin on CML and its underlying mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we found that morin dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of CML cell lines K562 and KCL22 and induced their apoptosis, with a significant increase in cell apoptosis upon exposure of cells to 50 mumol/L morin. Moreover, morin significantly reduced CML xenograft growth in nude mice. Mechanically, morin attenuated phosphorylated AKT level by upregulating PTEN expression, thus leading to the inhibition of AKT signaling. Knockdown of PTEN by its siRNA completely abrogated morin-induced cell apoptosis, indicating that PTEN mediates the inductive effect of morin on CML cell apoptosis. More importantly, we found that miR-188-5p was significantly upregulated in CML patients and CML cell lines. Treating CML cells with morin markedly downregulated the miR-188-5p expression level. Further, we demonstrated that miR-188-5p repressed PTEN expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR. miR-188-5p downregulation induced by morin enhanced CML cell apoptosis by relieving miR-188-5p repression of PTEN expression. In summary, morin exerts significant anticancer efficacy in CML by regulating the miR-188-5p/PTEN axis and thus repressing the PI3K/AKT signaling.","['Nie, Zi-Yuan', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiao-Jun', 'Yang, Zhan', 'Yang, Gao-Shan', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Qin, Yan', 'Yu, Jing', 'Jiang, Ling-Ling', 'Wen, Jin-Kun', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Nie ZY', 'Yang L', 'Liu XJ', 'Yang Z', 'Yang GS', 'Zhou J', 'Qin Y', 'Yu J', 'Jiang LL', 'Wen JK', 'Luo JM']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China. luojianmin1960@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190912,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,,,2019/09/14 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-19-0051 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0051 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Dec;18(12):2296-2307. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0051.

Circadian oscillations are regulated by interactions of BMAL1's C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) with the KIX domain of CBP/p300 (activating) and with the clock protein CRY1 (repressing) as well as by the BMAL1 G-region preceding the TAD. Circadian acetylation of Lys(537) within the G-region enhances repressive BMAL1-TAD-CRY1 interactions. Here, we characterized the interaction of the CBP-KIX domain with BMAL1 proteins, including the BMAL1-TAD, parts of the G-region, and Lys(537) Tethering the small compound 1-10 in the MLL-binding pocket of the CBP-KIX domain weakened BMAL1 binding, and MLL1-bound KIX did not form a ternary complex with BMAL1, indicating that the MLL-binding pocket is important for KIX-BMAL1 interactions. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) models of BMAL1 and BMAL1:KIX complexes revealed that the N-terminal BMAL1 G-region including Lys(537) forms elongated extensions emerging from the bulkier BMAL1-TAD:KIX core complex. Fitting high-resolution KIX domain structures into the SAXS-derived envelopes suggested that the G-region emerges near the MLL-binding pocket, further supporting a role of this pocket in BMAL1 binding. Additionally, mutations in the second CREB-pKID/c-Myb-binding pocket of the KIX domain moderately impacted BMAL1 binding. The BMAL1(K537Q) mutation mimicking Lys(537) acetylation, however, did not affect the KIX-binding affinity, in contrast to its enhancing effect on CRY1 binding.

Here, we explore cohesin dynamics and regulation of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and differentiation. Cohesin binding increases at active regulatory elements only during erythroid differentiation. Prior binding of the repressive Ets transcription factor Etv6 predicts cohesin binding at these elements and Etv6 interacts with cohesin at chromatin. Depletion of cohesin severely impairs erythroid differentiation, particularly at Etv6-prebound loci, but augments self-renewal programs. Together with corroborative findings in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patient samples, these data suggest cohesin-mediated alleviation of Etv6 repression is required for dynamic expression at critical erythroid genes during differentiation and how this may be perturbed in myeloid malignancies.","['Sasca, Daniel', 'Yun, Haiyang', 'Giotopoulos, George', 'Szybinski, Jakub', 'Evan, Theo', 'Wilson, Nicola K', 'Gerstung, Moritz', 'Gallipoli, Paolo', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Hills, Robert', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Osborne, Cameron S', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Campbell, Peter', 'Huntly, Brian J P']","['Sasca D', 'Yun H', 'Giotopoulos G', 'Szybinski J', 'Evan T', 'Wilson NK', 'Gerstung M', 'Gallipoli P', 'Green AR', 'Hills R', 'Russell N', 'Osborne CS', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Gottgens B', 'Campbell P', 'Huntly BJP']",,"['Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'European Bioinformatic Institute, Genome Campus, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Kings College London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Genome Campus, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['C18680/A25508/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/R009708/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC7484777,,,2019/09/14 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)73150-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001553 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Dec 12;134(24):2195-2208. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001553.,20200330,2195-2208,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (cohesins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism']",,,,['Blood. 2019 Dec 12;134(24):2123-2125.

Here, we report that Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) promotes disease progression in a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative neoplasia by repressing an inhibitory mechanism of preservation in leukemia stem/progenitor cells with leukemia-initiating capacity. Deletion of the Klf4 gene severely abrogated the maintenance of BCR-ABL1(p210)-induced CML by impairing survival and self-renewal in BCR-ABL1+ CD150+ lineage-negative Sca-1+ c-Kit+ leukemic cells. Mechanistically, KLF4 repressed the Dyrk2 gene in leukemic stem/progenitor cells; thus, loss of KLF4 resulted in elevated levels of dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), which were associated with inhibition of survival and self-renewal via depletion of c-Myc protein and p53 activation. In addition to transcriptional regulation, stabilization of DYRK2 protein by inhibiting ubiquitin E3 ligase SIAH2 with vitamin K3 promoted apoptosis and abrogated self-renewal in murine and human CML stem/progenitor cells. Altogether, our results suggest that DYRK2 is a molecular checkpoint controlling p53- and c-Myc-mediated regulation of survival and self-renewal in CML cells with leukemic-initiating capacity that can be targeted with small molecules.","['Park, Chun Shik', 'Lewis, Andrew H', 'Chen, Taylor J', 'Bridges, Cory S', 'Shen, Ye', 'Suppipat, Koramit', 'Puppi, Monica', 'Tomolonis, Julie A', 'Pang, Paul D', 'Mistretta, Toni-Ann', 'Ma, Leyuan', 'Green, Michael R', 'Rau, Rachel', 'Lacorazza, H Daniel']","['Park CS', 'Lewis AH', 'Chen TJ', 'Bridges CS', 'Shen Y', 'Suppipat K', 'Puppi M', 'Tomolonis JA', 'Pang PD', 'Mistretta TA', 'Ma L', 'Green MR', 'Rau R', 'Lacorazza HD']",,"['Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'MD/PhD Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA207086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD020066/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI036211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008231/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024574/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6887114,,,2019/09/14 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2018/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)73186-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2018875922 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Nov 28;134(22):1960-1972. doi: 10.1182/blood.2018875922.,20200317,1960-1972,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Siah2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Dyrk kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Vitamin K 3/pharmacology']",,,,['Blood. 2019 Nov 28;134(22):1884-1885.

It is known, that ASP can cause several toxicities such as hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, as well as severe lipid and coagulation disturbances. Administered steroids can result in diabetes, obesity, hyponatremia and also mild hyperlipemia, which can intensify side effects of asparaginase. When triglyceride elevation is greater than 1000mg/dl, the risk of pancreatitis is significantly increased. We report two patients who were hospitalized in Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin in Poland and developed severe hypertriglyceridemia after receiving asparaginase and steroid therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These patients were treated using plasmapheresis. This procedure was performed with a venous catheter in the femoral vein and 5% albumin or fresh frozen plasma as the replacement fluid. We analysed the laboratory and clinical data of these children. Plasmapheresis was well tolerated in both cases and a decrease of hypertriglyceridemia was quickly observed. However, the girl developed pancreatitis. In our opinion, plasmapheresis appears to be safe and effective in reducing hypertriglyceridemia. We could recommend that this procedure should be performed early, as soon as the triglyceride level is above 1000mg/dl, in order to prevent severe complications.

An important adverse effect of vincristine is neurotoxicity. The incidence of this adverse effect is well studied. The present was undertaken to determine the incidence of vincristine-induced neurotoxicity in children with ALL after the induction of remission phase of chemotherapy and to ascertain its correlation with undernutrition, vitamin B12, folate and iron deficiency. Thirty children (1-18 years) with ALL were enrolled at the commencement of chemotherapy. The electrophysiological evaluation was done at baseline and repeated after four doses of vincristine (1.5 mg/m(2)/dose). Clinical evaluation was done regularly. Anthropometry and serum B12, folate and ferritin levels were assessed at baseline. Twelve children over a 4-week period of observation had peripheral neuropathy clinically. The autonomic system was most commonly involved followed by motor and sensory system respectively. On electrophysiological testing, half of the patients had evidence of neuropathy. Micronutrient deficiencies were present in a significant number of patients-63.3% had a B12 deficiency, 20% were deficient in folate and 43.3% in iron. The incidence of vincristine-induced neuropathy in patients with/without these micro-nutrient deficiencies was not statistically significantly different. Vincristine-induced neuropathy is common in Indian children with ALL. The present study did not find any correlation between the occurrences of vincristine-induced neuropathy and nutritional deficiencies.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia managed at our tertiary eye care centre from January 2015 to December 2017. METHODS: Detailed ophthalmic and systemic evaluation, treatment and follow-up records were reviewed. The main measures studied were visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, retinopathy severity, and surgical indications and techniques. RESULTS: Of the six patients studied, three had diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia at presentation, while in three cases chronic myeloid leukaemia was diagnosed following evaluation for proliferative retinopathy. The visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to perception of light. All eyes had marked proliferative retinopathy out of proportion to the exudation. None of the eyes had significant macular oedema. Pan-retinal photocoagulation (10/12, 83.33%), intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection (8/12, 66.67%), vitrectomy (2/12, 16.67%), cataract surgery (2/12, 16.67%) and trabeculectomy followed by cryoablation (2/12, 16.67%) was performed for management of the ocular disease as indicated. Median follow-up was 16.5 months (range: 6-24 months). Final visual acuity ranged from PL to 20/20 with acuity 20/100 in eight eyes. Four eyes had advanced optic neuropathy from neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSION: Accelerated proliferative retinopathy can be seen in cases of diabetes with chronic myeloid leukaemia at the very initial ophthalmic evaluation. Thus, there is a need to alter screening guidelines for retinopathy in cases of diabetes with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Early detection and aggressive management may help preserve visual acuity in such cases.","['Chawla, Rohan', 'Kumar, Suneel', 'Kumawat, Devesh', 'Azad, Shorya Vardhan', 'Temkar, Shreyas', 'Jain, Shreyans']","['Chawla R', 'Kumar S', 'Kumawat D', 'Azad SV', 'Temkar S', 'Jain S']",,"['Dr. R.

Here, we report an ultrasensitive biosensor to detect protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7), an important protein biomarker on the cell surface, by aptamer conformation-cooperated enzyme-assisted surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) (ACCESS) technology. Our approach features a synergistic combination of the conformational alteration of the anglerfish aptamer triggered by the recognition of the membrane protein (PTK7) and Exo III enzyme-assisted nucleic acid amplification. It transduces the specific binding events between the aptamer and PTK7 protein into dramatically improved SERS signals. Sensitive and specific detection of PTK7 protein has been demonstrated both in the solution and directly on the surface of live CCRF-CEM cells, with a limit of detection better than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method by nearly 5 orders of magnitude. As a flexible, ultrasensitive, and specific approach, ACCESS promises important applications in clinical diagnostics, where only a very limited amount of the biological sample is available.","['Li, Yingying', 'Fang, Qianqian', 'Miao, Xinxing', 'Zhang, Xiuyan', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Yan, Jun', 'Zhang, Yiqiu', 'Wu, Renfei', 'Nie, Baoqing', 'Hirtz, Michael', 'Liu, Jian']","['Li Y', 'Fang Q', 'Miao X', 'Zhang X', 'Zhao Y', 'Yan J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu R', 'Nie B', 'Hirtz M', 'Liu J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2647-5317', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0095-8978']","['School of Electronic and Information Engineering , Soochow University , Suzhou , Jiangsu Province 215006 , China.', 'Institute of Nanotechnology (INT) and Karlsruhe Nano Micro Facility (KNMF) , Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) , Karlsruhe 76131 , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190919,United States,ACS Sens,ACS sensors,101669031,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA nanotechnology', '*SERS', '*aptamer', '*protein biomarker', '*signal amplification']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acssensors.9b00604 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Sens. 2019 Oct 25;4(10):2605-2614. doi: 10.1021/acssensors.9b00604.

Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) is an immunomodulatory molecule which has been shown in vitro to decrease the release of infective particles. The aim of this study was to follow the progress of the clinical score and viral parameters of FeLV- and FIV-naturally infected privately owned cats treated with recombinant human IFN-alpha (rHuIFN-alpha, Roferon-A). Twenty-seven FeLV-infected cats (FeLV+) and 31 FIV-infected cats (FIV+) were enrolled in the study. Owners were instructed to orally administer 1 mL/day of 60 IU rHuIFN-alpha/mL in alternating weeks for four months. Blood samples were taken at the beginning of the study (M0), mid-treatment (M2), end of treatment (M4), and 6-10 months later (M10). Clinical status at these time points improved notably with rHuIFN-alpha treatment, regardless of the initial severity of the disease, an effect which lasted throughout the study in most animals (15 of the 16 FeLV+ symptomatic cats; 20 of the 22 FIV+ symptomatic cats) improved markedly their clinical situation. In FeLV+ cats plasma antigenemia (p27CA), reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, and proviral load decreased at M2 and M4 but increased again at M10 (""rebound effect""). The level of antigenemia or RT activity was below the detection limits in FIV+ cats, and the effect on proviral load was less marked than in FeLV+ cats. Taken together, these results indicate that rHuIFN-alpha is a good candidate for treating FeLV+ cats, but the ""rebound effect"" seen when treatment was discontinued suggests that additional studies should be conducted to clarify its effect on progression of the infection in cats.","['Gomez-Lucia, Esperanza', 'Collado, Victorio M', 'Miro, Guadalupe', 'Martin, Sonsoles', 'Benitez, Laura', 'Domenech, Ana']","['Gomez-Lucia E', 'Collado VM', 'Miro G', 'Martin S', 'Benitez L', 'Domenech A']",,"['Department of Animal Health, Veterinary Faculty, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain. duato@ucm.es.', 'Department of Animal Health, Veterinary Faculty, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Health, Veterinary Faculty, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Veterinary Faculty, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physiology and Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, Complutense University of Madrid, Jose Antonio Novais, 12, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Health, Veterinary Faculty, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190911,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,PMC6783854,['NOTNLM'],"['*FIV', '*FeLV', '*antigenemia', '*feline immunodeficiency virus', '*feline leukemia virus', '*interferon', '*reverse transcriptase', '*treatment']",2019/09/14 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2019/09/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v11090845 [pii]', '10.3390/v11090845 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2019 Sep 11;11(9). pii: v11090845. doi: 10.3390/v11090845.,20200928,,,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cats/virology', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*drug effects', 'Interferon alpha-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Feline/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Pets/virology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Viral Load']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, the efficacy of RIC regimens for patients with high-risk disease is limited. The addition of a fludarabine, amsacrine, and cytarabine (FLAMSA)-sequential conditioning regimen was introduced for patients with high-risk MDS and AML to combine a high anti-leukemic activity with the advantages of RIC. The current systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of identifying all cohort studies of patients with AML and/or MDS who received FLAMSA-RIC to determine its efficacy and toxicity. Out of 3044 retrieved articles, 12 published studies with 2395 overall patients (18.1-76.0 years; 96.8% AML and 3.2% MDS; follow-up duration of 0.7-145 months; 50.3% had active AML disease before HSCT) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In the pooled analysis, the 1- and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 59.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 47.9-70.2%) and 40.2% (95% CI, 28.0-53.7%), respectively. The pooled 3-year OS rate of the patients who achieved CR1 or CR2 prior to HSCT was 60.1% (95% CI, 55.1-64.8%) and the percentage of those with relapse or refractory disease was 27.8% (95% CI, 23.3-32.8%). The pooled 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate was 39.3% (95% CI, 26.4-53.9%).

Retrospective analysis including all paediatric haematological malignancies patients with HSC treated in Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (2013-2018). Twenty-five patients with acute leukaemia developed HSFI (19 patients diagnosed as hepatosplenic candidiasis). Most of the cases (92%) occurred during the induction phase. Organs affected were as follows: liver in 18 patients, renal in 13 patients, spleen in 12 patients, skin in four patients and retina in one patient. Five (20%) patients had proven HSC, 14 (56%) probable and six (24%) possible HSFI. Ten patients had a PET-CT for response assessment. Candida tropicalis was the most common isolated spp. from blood/tissue culture. Six (24%) patients developed HSFI on top of antifungal prophylaxis. Steroids were given in 12 (52%) patients with HSFI as immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS). Caspofungin was the first line of treatment in 14 (56%) patients, liposomal amphotericin B in six (24%) patients and azoles in five (20%) patients. HSFI was associated with delayed of intensification phase of chemotherapy (median 42 days). The success rate was reported in 24 patients with complete response (68%) and partial response in (28%) patients, while failure (death) seen in 1(4%) patient. HSC is still a major challenge in paediatric leukaemias patients with impact on treatment delay and survival outcome. PET scan, non-culture diagnostics and steroid role evidence in IRS are growing. Antifungal stewardship for screening, early detection for high-risk patients and better response assessment is challenging.","['Madney, Youssef', 'Shalaby, Lobna', 'Elanany, Mervat', 'Adel, Naglaa', 'Nasr, Eman', 'Alsheshtawi, Khaled', 'Younes, Alaa', 'Hafez, Hanafy']","['Madney Y', 'Shalaby L', 'Elanany M', 'Adel N', 'Nasr E', 'Alsheshtawi K', 'Younes A', 'Hafez H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0511-1562'],"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Radiodiagnosis, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE), Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191113,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC)', 'hepatosplenic candidiasis (HSC)', 'hepatosplenic fungal infection (HSFI)', 'paediatric haematological malignancies']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.13002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2020 Jan;63(1):30-37. doi: 10.1111/myc.13002.

SUMMARY: We identified randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of NG-TKIs versus imatinib as the first-line treatment for CML patients by searching the PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate risk ratios and 95% CIs using a fixed-effects model.Our study included 10 trials. Overall, treatment with NG-TKIs significantly improved the major molecular response and MR4.5 at all time points, and early molecular response at 3 months. Importantly, overall survival (OS) was significantly higher with the NG-TKIs at 12 months. Besides, NG-TKI-treated patients showed a significantly lower CML-related death and progression to the accelerated phase/blast crisis. Key Messages: In first-line treatment, NG-TKIs are superior to imatinib regarding OS at 12 months, and because molecular response rates were higher with the NG-TKIs at all time points, the NG-TKIs favor treatment-free remission.","['Pan, Pan', 'Wang, Lijuan', 'Wang, Yanjun', 'Shen, Li', 'Zheng, Pingping', 'Bi, Chunli', 'Zhang, Anning', 'Lv, Yaogai', 'Xue, Zhiqiang', 'Sun, Mengzi', 'Sun, Chong', 'Li, Jiagen', 'Jin, Lina', 'Yao, Yan']","['Pan P', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Shen L', 'Zheng P', 'Bi C', 'Zhang A', 'Lv Y', 'Xue Z', 'Sun M', 'Sun C', 'Li J', 'Jin L', 'Yao Y']",,"['Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The Neuroscience Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Nursing Department, the Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of the Ministry of Education and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China, yaoyan@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20190912,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Imatinib', '*Meta-analysis', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['000501537 [pii]', '10.1159/000501537 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2020;143(3):204-216. doi: 10.1159/000501537.

They also differ by their molecular mechanism of action. Some are acting as competitive inhibitors and some others are covalent inhibitors. With these tools, the understanding of the potential therapeutic interest of CDK7 inhibitors in cancer is rapidly growing.

IIIM-290 is an in-house preclinical anticancer lead prepared by semisynthetic modification of the natural product rohitukine. It is an orally bioavailable Cdk inhibitor showing efficacy in xenograft models of pancreatic, colon and leukemia cancer. It demonstrated in vivo efficacy at a relatively higher dose owing to its poor aqueous solubility (~8.6microg/mL). Binary and ternary solid dispersions containing PVP K-30, xanthan gum, and PEG-PPG-PEG were selected after solubility screening of various hydrophilic polymers. Several formulations with varying ratios of polymers, alone and in combination, were prepared and investigated for their effects on the solubility enhancement of IIIM-290. The binary solid dispersion VKB-SD75, prepared with PVP K-30 at the ratio of 1:4 w/w, was identified as the optimized composition that displayed 17-fold improvement in the aqueous solubility of IIIM-290. VKB-SD75 was scaled up to a 100-g scale. IIIM-290 and VKB-SD75 were evaluated for DSC, p-XRD, FTIR, (1)H NMR, SEM, in vitro dissolution, and oral pharmacokinetics, as well as for in vivo anticancer activity in the Ehrlich solid tumor model.

However, as with all biologic medicines, the complex development and manufacturing process for rituximab have meant that the medicine attracts high treatment costs. Approved rituximab biosimilars have been comprehensively demonstrated to match the reference medicine. With the potential to increase access to biologic therapy, they have a key role in helping to improve patient outcomes in lymphoma care. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of rituximab in the treatment of lymphoma. We explore development and regulatory requirements for biosimilar development and the potential impact of these medicines on access and sustainability. Focusing on biosimilars of rituximab, we examine in detail the evidence for biosimilarity for the two rituximab biosimilars that are approved in Europe and provide an overview of rituximab biosimilars currently in development. Expert opinion: We foresee a wider uptake of biosimilar medicines for lymphoma treatment over the next 5 years. The associated cost savings should be invested in broadening patient access to biological therapies, enabling wider use of more expensive treatment strategies and driving innovation in cancer care.","['Jurczak, Wojciech', 'Dlugosz Danecka, Monika', 'Buske, Christian']","['Jurczak W', 'Dlugosz Danecka M', 'Buske C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1879-8084'],"['Oncology Centre, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute , Krakow , Poland.', 'Oncology Centre, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute , Krakow , Poland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Ulm, Institute for Experimental Tumor Research, University Hospital Ulm , Ulm , Baden-Wurttemberg , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Biosimilar', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', '*extrapolation', '*follicular lymphoma', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*rituximab']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2019.1665017 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2019 Oct;19(10):1045-1056. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2019.1665017.,20200420,1045-1056,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/*therapeutic use', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells upregulate the TCA cycle in response to DNA damaging agents and treatment with devimistat increases sensitivity to them. A Phase I study of devimistat in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone produced a complete remission rate of 50% in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

Recently, complex karyotype (CK) has been demonstrated as an independent negative prognostic factor in CLL. METHODS: A series of 1012 untreated CLL patients have been investigated with both FISH and chromosome banding analysis (CBA) on the same pellet obtained from interleukin IL-2-CPG DSP30 oligonucleotide-stimulated cultured cells. RESULTS: Combining both FISH and CBA has led to refine prognostic categories with identification of 30% of CK in low-risk and intermediate FISH group. This raises the issue of switching them to a high-risk group. While this series confirmed the significant association between CK and high-risk FISH (P = .003), 33% of CK present no ATM or TP53 deletion. Three groups characterized by significant association between FISH markers and CBA have emerged: CK with TP53 loss and monosomy 15; CK with ATM loss and 14q32 translocation; and CK without ATM or TP53 losses but trisomies 12, 18, and 19 or t(14;18)(q32;q21). CONCLUSION: We have observed that in addition to FISH analysis, the CBA allows detection of many abnormalities with potential impact on patient follow-up and treatment, mainly CK.","['Senouci, Amel', 'Smol, Thomas', 'Tricot, Sabine', 'Bakala, Jania', 'Moulessehoul, Soraya', 'Quilichini, Benoit', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Herbaux, Charles', 'Daudignon, Agnes']","['Senouci A', 'Smol T', 'Tricot S', 'Bakala J', 'Moulessehoul S', 'Quilichini B', 'Penther D', 'Herbaux C', 'Daudignon A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0119-5896', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4574-3663']","['Laboratoire de Bio-toxicologie, Universite de Sidi Bel Abbes, Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria.', 'Institut de Genetique Medicale, CHU de Lille, Lille, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CH de Valenciennes, Valenciennes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CH de Lens, Lens, France."", 'Laboratoire de Bio-toxicologie, Universite de Sidi Bel Abbes, Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria.', 'Service de Cytogenetique, Laboratoire Biomnis, Lyon, France.', 'Service de Genetique Oncologique, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Institut de Genetique Medicale, CHU de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20191001,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,['NOTNLM'],"['FISH markers', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'complex karyotype']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13329 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Dec;103(6):607-613. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13329.

With up to 71 months (median 41 months) of ibrutinib therapy, the safety profile remained consistent with prior reports; cumulatively, all-grade (grade >/=3) hypertension and atrial fibrillation occurred in 21% (9%) and 12% (6%) of patients, respectively. Only 16% discontinued ibrutinib because of adverse events (AEs). These long-term results confirm the robust efficacy of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL irrespective of high-risk clinical or genomic features, with no unexpected AEs.

Early tumor dissemination, late diagnosis and insensitivity to conventional treatment are the major reasons for its high mortality rate. Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are overexpressed in PDAC and play important roles in its malignant progression, suggesting that VEGF-targeted therapies may interrupt the proliferation and motility of PDAC cells. Here, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor inhibitor, on PDAC cells. METHODS: Anti-proliferative effects of cediranib were determined using cell proliferation and crystal violet staining assays. Annexin V/PI staining, radiation therapy, and cell migration and invasion assays were carried out to examine the effects of cediranib on apoptosis, radio-sensitivity and cell motility, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses were applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activity of cediranib. RESULTS: We found that cediranib decreased PDAC cell proliferation and clonogenic survival and induced apoptotic cell death through inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins cIAP1, XIAP, MCL-1 and survivin. Combination with cediranib synergistically increased the sensitivity of PDAC cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel, and potentiated the effects of radiation therapy on PDAC cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. Furthermore, we found that treatment with cediranib impaired PDAC cell migration and invasion via expression reduction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers ZEB1, N-cadherin and Snail. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that cediranib may exhibit anti-tumor activity in PDAC cells and provide a rationale for further investigation of the potential of VEGF receptor-targeted therapies for the treatment of PDAC.","['Momeny, Majid', 'Alishahi, Zivar', 'Eyvani, Haniyeh', 'Esmaeili, Fatemeh', 'Zaghal, Azam', 'Ghaffari, Parisa', 'Tavakkoly-Bazzaz, Javad', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Momeny M', 'Alishahi Z', 'Eyvani H', 'Esmaeili F', 'Zaghal A', 'Ghaffari P', 'Tavakkoly-Bazzaz J', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Ghaffari SH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7755-0826'],"['Turku Bioscience Center, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Turku, Finland. majid.momeny@hotmail.com.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari200@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['N/A/Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati', 'Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences']",['Journal Article'],20190906,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cediranib', 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'Therapeutic sensitization', 'VEGF family']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13402-019-00473-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-019-00473-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2020 Feb;43(1):81-93. doi: 10.1007/s13402-019-00473-9.

RECENT FINDINGS: Venetoclax, alone or in combination with other targeted agents results in high rate of durable responses and undetectable measurable residual disease. Venetoclax maintains activity across all clinical and biologic subgroups, including those with high risk disease, including CLL with chromosome 17p deletion. TLS risk can be mitigated with risk stratification and five-week administration ramp-up schedule. Venetoclax, a novel, orally bioavailable inhibitor of BCL-2 has demonstrated substantial clinical activity in the treatment of CLL. In combination with other targeted agents it can induce high disease response rates and potentially lead to MRD-negative durable remissions.","['Eradat, Herbert']",['Eradat H'],,"['David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

We aimed to identify the risk factors for cGVHD in patients who underwent anti-thymocyte globulin-based haplo-HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (n = 280). The diagnosis of cGVHD was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health consensus criteria. A total of 169 patients suffered from cGVHD. The patients who had 3 loci mismatched had a higher 8-year incidence of cGVHD (total, 66.0% vs. 53.7%, P = 0.031; moderate to severe, 42.4% vs. 30.1%, P = 0.036) than the patients who had 1 to 2 loci mismatched. The patients who had maternal donors had a higher 8-year incidence of moderate to severe cGVHD (49.2% vs. 32.9%, P = 0.024) compared with the patients who had other donors. The patients who had grades III to IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) had higher 8-year incidence of cGVHD (total, 88.0% vs. 50.4%, P < 0.001; moderate to severe, 68.0% vs. 27.0%, P < 0.001) compared with the patients without aGVHD. In multivariate analysis, grades III to IV aGVHD was the only independent risk factor for cGVHD. Thus, further interventions should be considered in patients with severe aGVHD to prevent cGVHD.","['Lv, Meng', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Xu, Lanping', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yan, Chenhua', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yuhong', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Fengrong', 'Wang, Jingzhi', 'Liu, Kaiyan', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Mo, Xiaodong']","['Lv M', 'Zhang X', 'Xu L', 'Wang Y', 'Yan C', 'Chen H', 'Chen Y', 'Han W', 'Wang F', 'Wang J', 'Liu K', 'Huang X', 'Mo X']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, 100044, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China. mxd453@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190911,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,['NOTNLM'],"['National Institutes of Health consensus criteria', 'acute graft-versus-host disease', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'anti-thymocyte globulin', 'chronic graft-versus-host disease']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/05/23 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11684-019-0702-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11684-019-0702-z [pii]']",ppublish,Front Med. 2019 Dec;13(6):667-679. doi: 10.1007/s11684-019-0702-z.

The toxicity and efficacy of adding midostaurin to IC in patients not originally included in the RATIFY study or with intensified daunorubicin dosing are unknown. We conducted a retrospective, multi-center, historical-control study to characterize the safety and efficacy of adding midostaurin to IC in a ""real-world"" setting. Sixty-nine adult patients were included in the analysis (midostaurin n = 34, historical controls n = 35) with a mean follow-up of 18.4 (+/- 15) months. Median age of patients was 60 (range 26-82) years; 32% and 20% of patients were > 65 and 70 years, respectively. No differences in baseline characteristics were noted between the groups. Midostaurin was administered with 90 mg/m(2) daunorubicin in 29% of patients; One-third of patients experienced dose reductions/interruptions during midostaurin therapy. Overall toxicity was comparable between the midostaurin and control groups.CR/CRi rates were higher in patients treated with midostaurin compared with controls (80% vs. 57%, p = 0.047) and significantly more patients in the midostaurin group were transplanted in first remission (95% vs. 68%, p = 0.04).Median OS and DFS were higher in the midostaurin vs. control group (not reached vs. 11 months (p = 0.085) and 13 vs. 6 months (p = 0.09), respectively). In our analysis, midostaurin was not associated with increased toxicity including in older patients, in those with secondary AML or when administered with intensified daunorubicin dosage. Higher remission rates in the midostaurin group and increased transplantation rates in first CR were associated with a trend towards better outcomes.","['Berger, Tamar', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Moshe, Yakir', 'Yaari, Shilo', 'Frisch, Avraham', 'Hellmann, Ilana', 'Apel, Arie', 'Aviram, Adina', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Ram, Ron', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Ofran, Yishai', 'Wolach, Ofir']","['Berger T', 'Rozovski U', 'Moshe Y', 'Yaari S', 'Frisch A', 'Hellmann I', 'Apel A', 'Aviram A', 'Koren-Michowitz M', 'Yeshurun M', 'Ram R', 'Raanani P', 'Ofran Y', 'Wolach O']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8662-0707'],"['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shamir Medical Center, Zeriffin, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematological Laboratories, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shamir Medical Center, Zeriffin, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel. owolach@gmail.com.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. owolach@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190911,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3 mutation', 'Midostaurin']",2019/09/13 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03795-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03795-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Dec;98(12):2711-2717. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03795-8.

It would be ideal to conduct part of the treatment at home. This can only be done with adequately trained personnel. In the Netherlands, specialized pediatric oncology home care nurse practitioners have been trained to deliver this kind of care. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to administer intravenous chemotherapy at home. PURPOSE: This study aimed to safely administer chemotherapy intravenously (iv) at home by specialized nurse practitioners and aimed to increase the quality of life (QOL) of the child and decrease the social burden in families with a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHOD: The pilot study was performed by well-trained home care nurse practitioners. Low-dose methotrexate iv and low-dose cytarabine iv were administered to 11 included children with ALL in their home environment. RESULTS: QOL increased whereas social burden decreased for patients and parents. Chemotherapy administration in the home environment was safe with the help of well-trained nurse practitioners. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to administer intravenous chemotherapy at home in a safe and efficient way. The role of the specialized pediatric oncology nurse practitioner is an essential one.","['Kok, N T M', 'Ligthart-Beukhof, A C', 'van de Wetering, M D']","['Kok NTM', 'Ligthart-Beukhof AC', 'van de Wetering MD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0375-2019'],"['University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. ntmkok@gmail.com.', 'Prinses Maxima Center, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Prinses Maxima Center, Utrecht, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190905,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Children', 'Homecare', 'Nurse practitioner']",2019/09/13 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-019-05053-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-019-05053-z [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Dec;27(12):4389-4391. doi: 10.1007/s00520-019-05053-z.

Because of the high frequency of VCM use for febrile neutropenia and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, haematologic patients have a different nephrotoxic background compared with patients with other diseases. Therefore, it is unclear whether the risk factors of VCM-induced AKI identified in other patient groups are also applicable to haematologic patients. Herein, we performed a single-centre retrospective analysis to identify the factors associated with VCM-induced AKI in haematologic patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 150 haematologic patients to whom VCM was administered between April 2010 and March 2018 at Tokushima University Hospital. VCM-induced AKI was defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for VCM-induced AKI. RESULTS: Seventeen patients had VCM-induced AKI. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors of VCM-induced AKI were an initial VCM trough concentration of > 15 mg/L and concomitant use of tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB). Patients with an initial VCM trough concentration of < 10 mg/L showed significantly lower efficacy in febrile neutropenia. Interestingly, concomitant L-AMB use increased the incidence of VCM-induced AKI in a VCM concentration-dependent manner, whereas concomitant TAZ/PIPC increased the incidence in a VCM concentration-independent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal initial VCM trough concentration was 10-15 mg/L in haematologic patients, considering safety and effectiveness. There were differences in the effect of VCM-induced AKI between nephrotoxic drugs.","['Okada, Naoto', 'Chuma, Masayuki', 'Azuma, Momoyo', 'Nakamura, Shingen', 'Miki, Hirokazu', 'Hamano, Hirofumi', 'Goda, Mitsuhiro', 'Takechi, Kenshi', 'Zamami, Yoshito', 'Abe, Masahiro', 'Ishizawa, Keisuke']","['Okada N', 'Chuma M', 'Azuma M', 'Nakamura S', 'Miki H', 'Hamano H', 'Goda M', 'Takechi K', 'Zamami Y', 'Abe M', 'Ishizawa K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2476-9191'],"['Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan. naoto-o@tokushima-u.ac.jp.', 'Clinical Trial Center for Developmental Therapeutics, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Control and Prevention, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, 3-8-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Clinical Trial Center for Developmental Therapeutics, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Tokushima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 3-8-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, 3-8-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tokushima University Hospital, 2-50-1 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Tokushima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 3-8-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],['19K16414/JSPS KAKENHI'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190911,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute kidney injury', 'Liposomal amphotericin B', 'Tazobactam/piperacillin', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring', 'Vancomycin']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00228-019-02756-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-019-02756-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Dec;75(12):1695-1704. doi: 10.1007/s00228-019-02756-4.

The discovery of mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL have uncovered activated JAK-STAT signaling as a primary driver of MF, supporting a rationale for JAK inhibition. However, JAK inhibition alone is insufficient for long-term remission and offers modest, if any, disease-modifying effects. Given this, there is great interest in identifying mechanisms that cooperate with JAK-STAT signaling to predict disease progression and rationally guide the development of novel therapies.

Along with the development of new and effective therapies, improved outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma have increased the interest in minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. However, the considerable heterogeneity of immunophenotypic and molecular markers of myeloma cells has limited its clinical application. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural compound in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Following ALA treatment, tumor cells preferentially accumulate porphyrins because of the differential activities of aerobic glycolysis, known as Warburg effect. Among various porphyrins, protoporphyrine IX is a strong photosensitizer; thus, ALA-based photodynamic diagnosis has been widely used in various solid cancers. Here, the feasibility of flow cytometry-based photodynamic detection of MRD was tested in multiple myeloma. Among various human cell lines of hematological malignancies, including K562 erythroleukemia, Jurkat T-cell leukemia, Nalm6 pre-B cell leukemia, KG1a myeloid leukemia, and U937 monocytic leukemia, human myeloma cell line, KMS18, and OPM2 abundantly expressed ALA transporters, such as SLC36A1 and SLC15A2, and 1 mM ALA treatment for 24 h resulted in nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence expression, which could be competitively inhibited by ALA transport with gamma-aminobutyric acid. Titration studies revealed that the lowest ALA concentration required to achieve nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence in KMS18 cells was 0.25 mM, with an incubation period of 2 h. Under these conditions, incubation of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in only 1.8 % of the cells exhibiting porphyrin fluorescence. Therefore, flow cytometry-based photodynamic diagnosis is a promising approach for detecting MRD in multiple myeloma.","['Iwaki, Keita', 'Fujiwara, Tohru', 'Ito, Takako', 'Suzuki, Chie', 'Sasaki, Katsuyuki', 'Ono, Koya', 'Saito, Kei', 'Fukuhara, Noriko', 'Onishi, Yasushi', 'Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Fujimaki, Shinichi', 'Tanaka, Tohru', 'Tamura, Hideto', 'Fujiwara, Minami', 'Harigae, Hideo']","['Iwaki K', 'Fujiwara T', 'Ito T', 'Suzuki C', 'Sasaki K', 'Ono K', 'Saito K', 'Fukuhara N', 'Onishi Y', 'Yokoyama H', 'Fujimaki S', 'Tanaka T', 'Tamura H', 'Fujiwara M', 'Harigae H']",,"['Division of Blood Transfusion and Cell Processing, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Laboratory Diagnostics, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion and Cell Processing, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Laboratory Diagnostics, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Laboratory Diagnostics, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Laboratory Diagnostics, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'SBI Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion and Cell Processing, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion and Cell Processing, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Laboratory Diagnostics, Tohoku University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-aminolevulinic acid', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease', 'multiple myeloma', 'protoporphyrin IX']",2019/09/13 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.249.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2019 Sep;249(1):19-28. doi: 10.1620/tjem.249.19.,20200217,19-28,,"['0 (5-amino levulinic acid)', '0 (Levulinic Acids)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Levulinic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Protoporphyrins/therapeutic use', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Prosurvival signaling derived from the microenvironment is often mediated via JAK signaling. However, whether JAK inhibitors are useful in CLL therapy has not been studied extensively. JAK inhibitors are valuable therapeutic agents in myelofibrosis and show promising results in graft-versus-host-disease. However, JAK inhibition is associated with an increased infection risk, presumably because of the effect on other immune cells, a feature shared with other kinase inhibitors used for CLL treatment, such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib. We compared functional effects of the JAK1/2 inhibitors momelotinib and ruxolitinib, the BTK inhibitors ibrutinib and tirabrutinib, and PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib on malignant CLL cells but also on healthy human T, B, and NK lymphocytes. We found several interesting differences among the inhibitors, apart from expected and well-known effects. Momelotinib but not ruxolitinib blocked cytokine-induced proliferation of CLL cells. Momelotinib also reduced BCR signaling, in contrast to ruxolitinib, indicating that these JAK inhibitors in fact have a distinct target spectrum. In contrast to tirabrutinib, ibrutinib had inhibitory effects on T cell activation, probably because of ITK inhibition. Remarkably, both BTK inhibitors stimulated IFN-gamma production in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Collectively, our results demonstrate that kinase inhibitors directed at identical targets may have differential effects on lymphocyte function. Their unique profile could be strategically employed to balance desired versus unwanted lymphocyte inhibition.","['Hofland, Tom', 'de Weerdt, Iris', 'Ter Burg, Hanneke', 'de Boer, Renate', 'Tannheimer, Stacey', 'Tonino, Sanne H', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Hofland T', 'de Weerdt I', 'Ter Burg H', 'de Boer R', 'Tannheimer S', 'Tonino SH', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']",,"['Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands; t.hofland@amc.uva.nl e.eldering@amc.uva.nl.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA 94404; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center 1105 AZ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center 1105 AZ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands; t.hofland@amc.uva.nl e.eldering@amc.uva.nl.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center 1105 AZ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190911,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,,,2019/09/13 06:00,2020/05/23 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900321 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900321 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Oct 15;203(8):2100-2109. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900321.

The introduction of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) therapy has dramatically improved survival in these patients, yet the off-target effects of this treatment may have long-term health impacts on CML survivors. The risk of adverse health outcomes is especially important in children, where TKI exposure may occur during critical windows of growth and puberty, and patients require treatment for prolonged periods of time. The aim of this systematic review protocol is to report on the methods used to conduct a systematic review to investigate the endometabolic and bone health effects of TKI therapy in CML. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Searches will be conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and MEDLINE from inception on August 1st, 2019. Searches may be updated while performing the systematic review to ensure new evidence is included if applicable. Grey literature search will include ClinicalTrials.gov and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I. We will perform a meta-analysis if there are at least two studies reporting similar populations, interventions, methods and tracking the same outcome measures. The studies should also have similar age and sex distributions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this is a systematic review protocol, it does not include patient data; therefore, Research Ethics Board approval is not indicated. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.

When we initiated this study with nilotinib, imatinib was the only tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML in chronic phase (CP); alternative treatment options were needed, particularly for patients who developed resistance or intolerance (R/I) to imatinib. This phase 2 study enrolled pediatric patients with either Ph+ CML-CP R/I to imatinib or dasatinib or newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. Data presented are from analyses with minimum follow-up of up to 24 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days). Fifty-nine patients with Ph+ CML-CP were enrolled, and 58 were treated (R/I, n = 33; newly diagnosed, n = 25). Major molecular response (MMR) rate at cycle 6 in the R/I cohort was 39.4% (primary end point); 57.6% of patients achieved or maintained MMR and 81.8% achieved or maintained complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 24 cycles. In patients with newly diagnosed disease, rates of MMR by cycle 12 and CCyR at cycle 12 were 64.0% each (primary end points); by cycle 24, cumulative MMR and CCyR rates were 68.0% and 84.0%, respectively. The safety profile of nilotinib in pediatric patients was generally comparable with the known safety profile in adults, although cardiovascular events were not observed in this study, and hepatic laboratory abnormalities were more frequent; no new safety signals were identified. In summary, nilotinib demonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile in pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP.

Prognosis and overall survival (OS) remain poor in elderly patients and in those not eligible for intensive treatment. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have played an important role in this group of patients but their efficacy is limited. Areas covered: This article reviews the mechanism of action, pharmacology, safety profile and clinical efficacy of subcutaneous guadecitabine, a second-generation DNA methylation inhibitor in development for the treatment of AML and MDS. Expert opinion: Although guadecitabine did not yield improved complete remission (CR) rates and OS compared to the control arm in patients with treatment-naive AML who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, subgroup analysis in patients who received >/=4 cycles of therapy demonstrated superior outcomes in favor of guadecitabine. Given its stability, ease of administration, safety profile and prolonged exposure time, guadecitabine would be the more appropriate HMA, replacing azacitidine and decitabine, to be used combination treatment regimens in patients with myeloid malignancies.","['Daher-Reyes, Georgina S', 'Merchan, Brayan M', 'Yee, Karen W L']","['Daher-Reyes GS', 'Merchan BM', 'Yee KWL']",,"['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , Ontario , Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , Ontario , Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , Ontario , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190919,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'SGI-110', 'guadecitabine', 'hypomethylating agent', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2019/09/13 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/09/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2019.1667331 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2019 Oct;28(10):835-849. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2019.1667331.

Thus, a number of bioinformatic tools have been developed to infer heterogeneous tumor populations based on genomic signatures such as mutations and copy number variations. Despite accumulating evidence for the significance of global DNA methylation reprogramming in certain cancer types including myeloid malignancies, none of the bioinformatic tools are designed to exploit subclonally reprogrammed methylation patterns to reveal constituent populations of a tumor. In accordance with the notion of global methylation reprogramming, our preliminary observations on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples implied the existence of subclonally occurring focal methylation aberrance throughout the genome. RESULTS: We present PRISM, a tool for inferring the composition of epigenetically distinct subclones of a tumor solely from methylation patterns obtained by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. PRISM adopts DNA methyltransferase 1-like hidden Markov model-based in silico proofreading for the correction of erroneous methylation patterns. With error-corrected methylation patterns, PRISM focuses on a short individual genomic region harboring dichotomous patterns that can be split into fully methylated and unmethylated patterns. Frequencies of such two patterns form a sufficient statistic for subclonal abundance. A set of statistics collected from each genomic region is modeled with a beta-binomial mixture. Fitting the mixture with expectation-maximization algorithm finally provides inferred composition of subclones. Applying PRISM for two AML samples, we demonstrate that PRISM could infer the evolutionary history of malignant samples from an epigenetic point of view.

There are many studies showed that low levels of FA could promote cell proliferation, however, little is known about the signal pathways. To determine the potential molecular mechanisms, human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562cells) and human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE cells) were exposed to different concentrations of FA. The data showed that FA at 0-125muM or 0-60muM promoted the proliferation of K562cells or 16HBE cells respectively, indicating that FA did have the Hormesis effect. FA at 75muM (K562cells) and 40muM (16HBE cells) significantly promoted cell proliferation, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and decreased glutathione (GSH) content. At the same time, FA treatment induced a marked increase in the key molecules of cell division like CyclinD-cdk4 and E2F1. In addition, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), glucose, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) content in the Warburg effect were increased. Administering Vitamin E (VE), significantly disrupted cell division and disturbed the Warburg effect, effectively indicating the decrease of cell activity. Conclusively, these findings suggested that low concentrations of FA could promote cell proliferation by accelerating cell division process or enhancing the Warburg effect to embody the Hormesis effect.","['An, Jieran', 'Li, Fuhong', 'Qin, Yujie', 'Zhang, Hongmao', 'Ding, Shumao']","['An J', 'Li F', 'Qin Y', 'Zhang H', 'Ding S']",,"['Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Functional Dairy, Co-constructed by the Ministry of Education and Beijing Municipality, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.

We uncover regulatory variation among patients translating into a transcriptional signature that predicts relapse risk. In addition, we find clusters of coexpressed genes within this signature selectively link to relapse risk in distinct patient subgroups defined by molecular subtype or AML maturation. Analyzing these gene clusters and the AML subtypes separately enhances their prognostic value substantially and provides insight in the mechanisms underlying relapse risk across the distinct patient subgroups.

CCR5 is a reasonable but not absolutely protective target for a cure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, because CCR5-null blood cells are largely resistant to HIV-1 entry. We transplanted CRISPR-edited CCR5-ablated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into a patient with HIV-1 infection and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The acute lymphoblastic leukemia was in complete remission with full donor chimerism, and donor cells carrying the ablated CCR5 persisted for more than 19 months without gene editing-related adverse events. The percentage of CD4+ cells with CCR5 ablation increased by a small degree during a period of antiretroviral-therapy interruption. Although we achieved successful transplantation and long-term engraftment of CRISPR-edited HSPCs, the percentage of CCR5 disruption in lymphocytes was only approximately 5%, which indicates the need for further research into this approach.

Two types of Abeta oligomers were used in the study. The first type was produced in the presence of oligomerization inhibitor, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The second type of amyloids was assembled in the absence of the inhibitor. The first type preparation was predominantly populated with dimers and trimers, while the second type contained mostly pentadecamers. These amyloid species exhibited different secondary protein structure with considerable amount of antiparallel beta sheet structural elements in HFIP oligomerized Abeta mixtures. The effect of the cell growth inhibition, which was stronger in the case of HFIP Abeta oligomers, was observed for all cell lines. Tests aiming at elucidating the effects of the amyloid species on cell cycles showed little differences between amyloid preparations. This prompts us to conclude that the effect on the cancer cell proliferation rate is less specific to the biological processes developing inside the cells during the proliferation. Therefore, cell growth inhibition may involve interactions with the peripheral parts of the cancer cells, such as a phospholipid membrane, and only in case of the NB4 cells, where accumulation of amyloid species inside the cells was detected, one may imply the opposite. In general, cancer cells were much less susceptible to the damaging effects of amyloid oligomers compared to earlier observations in mixed neuronal cell cultures.","['Pavliukeviciene, Bozena', 'Zentelyte, Aiste', 'Jankunec, Marija', 'Valiuliene, Giedre', 'Talaikis, Martynas', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta', 'Niaura, Gediminas', 'Valincius, Gintaras']","['Pavliukeviciene B', 'Zentelyte A', 'Jankunec M', 'Valiuliene G', 'Talaikis M', 'Navakauskiene R', 'Niaura G', 'Valincius G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2707-7724', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1225-0643']","['Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190911,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6738617,,,2019/09/12 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0221563 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-23632 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Sep 11;14(9):e0221563. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221563. eCollection 2019.,20200310,e0221563,,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Propanols)', '3D632GYQ50 (hexafluoroisopropanol)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Propanols/*adverse effects', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Secondary/drug effects']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 383 patients with AdvSM from the German Registry on Disorders of Eosinophils and Mast Cells (training set; n = 231) and several centers for mastocytosis in the United States and Europe, all within the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (validation set; n = 152). A Cox multivariable model was used to select variables that were predictive of overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, the following risk factors were identified as being associated with OS: age greater than 60 years, anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 10(9)/L), presence of one high molecular risk gene mutation (ie, in SRSF2, ASXL1, and/or RUNX1), and presence of two or more high molecular risk gene mutations. By assigning hazard ratio-weighted points to these variables, the following three risk categories were defined: low risk (median OS, not reached), intermediate risk (median OS, 3.9 years; 95% CI, 2.1 to 5.7 years), and high risk (median OS, 1.9 years; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.6 years; P < .001). The mutation-adjusted risk score (MARS) was independent of the WHO classification and was confirmed in the independent validation set. During a median follow-up time of 2.2 years (range, 0 to 23 years), 63 (16%) of 383 patients experienced a leukemic transformation to secondary mast cell leukemia (32%) or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (68%). The MARS was also predictive for leukemia-free survival (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The MARS is a validated, five-parameter, WHO-independent prognostic score that defines three risk groups among patients with AdvSM and may improve up-front treatment stratification for these rare hematologic neoplasms.","['Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Alvarez-Twose, Ivan', 'Shoumariyeh, Khalid', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Lubke, Johannes', 'Perkins, Cecelia', 'Munoz-Gonzalez, Javier I', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Kennedy, Vanessa', 'Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'von Bubnoff, Nikolas', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Garcia-Montero, Andres C', 'Valent, Peter', 'Gotlib, Jason', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Reiter, Andreas']","['Jawhar M', 'Schwaab J', 'Alvarez-Twose I', 'Shoumariyeh K', 'Naumann N', 'Lubke J', 'Perkins C', 'Munoz-Gonzalez JI', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Kennedy V', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Fabarius A', 'Pfeifer D', 'Sotlar K', 'Horny HP', 'von Bubnoff N', 'Haferlach T', 'Cross NCP', 'Hofmann WK', 'Sperr WR', 'Garcia-Montero AC', 'Valent P', 'Gotlib J', 'Orfao A', 'Reiter A']",,"['University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Spanish Network on Mastocytosis, Toledo and Salamanca, Spain.', 'Virgen del Valle Hospital, Toledo, Spain.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Spanish Network on Mastocytosis, Toledo and Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca and Biomedical Research Institute of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom.', 'University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Spanish Network on Mastocytosis, Toledo and Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca and Biomedical Research Institute of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Spanish Network on Mastocytosis, Toledo and Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca and Biomedical Research Institute of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20190911,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC6823885,,,2019/09/12 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.00640 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Nov 1;37(31):2846-2856. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.00640.

Chemotherapy alters these signals to induce cell death. However, drug resistance in AML remains a major hindrance to successful treatment and early warning is unavailable. Modulation of signaling pathways during chemotherapy may provide a window to detect response and predict treatment outcome. Blood samples collected from AML patients before and at day-3 of induction therapy were compared for changes in expression of CD117, CD34, pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of Akt and MAPK pathways, using multi-color flow cytometry. Nine patients were diagnosed as drug-resistant and seven sensitive to chemotherapy. Twelve were paired. Average percentages of CD34 (66.8 +/- 11.7% vs. 26.2 +/- 5.8%, p = 0.033) and pBAD (66.9 +/- 8.2% vs. 28.9 +/- 8.2%, p = 0.016) were significantly increased in chemo-resistant (N = 9) compared to chemo-sensitive (N = 5) samples. Percentages of CD34 were strongly correlated with pBAD (R = 0.785; p = 0.001; N = 14) and pFKHR (R = 0.755; p = 0.002; N = 14) at day-3 induction. Chemo-sensitive cases expressed significantly higher percentages of IL-18Ralpha (71.9 +/- 9.6% vs. 29.8 +/- 5.8%, p = 0.016). Though not significantly different in the outcome, IL-1beta was strongly associated with activated Akt-S473, IL-6 with phosphorylated JNK and FKHR while TNF-alpha appeared to trigger Bim, in treated samples. These preliminary results suggested AML cells resistant to chemotherapy increased expression of CD34 and may signal through pBAD while cells sensitive to chemotherapy-induced IL18Ralpha expression. These were observed early during induction therapy. Identifying CD34 is interesting as it is a convenient marker to monitor drug-resistance in AML patients. Inhibition of CD34 and pBAD signaling may be important in treating drug-resistant AML.","['Yiau, Stephnie Kang-Xian', 'Lee, CinDee', 'Mohd Tohit, Eusni Rahayu', 'Chang, Kian Meng', 'Abdullah, Maha']","['Yiau SK', 'Lee C', 'Mohd Tohit ER', 'Chang KM', 'Abdullah M']",,"['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Ampang, Jalan Mewah Utara , Ampang , Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190911,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD34', 'IL-18Ralpha', 'drug-resistant', 'phosphorylated-BAD']",2019/09/12 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10799893.2019.1660899 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2019 Jun;39(3):276-282. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2019.1660899.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 36 patients diagnosed with MDS and treated with EPO alfa at 30,000 to 60,000 IU per week. Clinical data were collected from medical records. The events assessed were non-response to treatment and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 and SPSS 24 software. RESULTS: The overall survival of patients who received EPO alfa treatment was 51.64%, with a median of 65 months of treatment, and the overall survival of this group was 100% during the first 24 months. We detected a 43.5-month median event-free survival, with a response rate of 80.5%. We observed responses from 25 to 175 months. Patients with transfusion dependence and those with a high-risk stratification, as determined by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), the WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) and the WHO 2016, had a lower event-free survival than other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the wide use of EPO alfa in the treatment of anaemia in patients with MDS, the median response duration is approximately only 24 months. Our data provide encouraging results concerning the benefits of using EPO alfa for the improvement of the quality of life, as patients treated with EPO showed higher overall survival, event-free survival rates and longer response durations than have been previously described in the literature.","['Moura, Anna Thawanny Gadelha', 'Duarte, Fernando Barroso', 'Barbosa, Maritza Cavalcante', 'Santos, Talyta Ellen de Jesus Dos', 'Lemes, Romelia Pinheiro Goncalves']","['Moura ATG', 'Duarte FB', 'Barbosa MC', 'Santos TEJD', 'Lemes RPG']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6582-7867', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5170-695X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8980-5638', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4167-6491', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3178-412X']","['Laboratorio de Pesquisa em Hemoglobinopatias e Genetica das Doencas Hematologicas, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, BR.', 'Departamento de Cirurgia, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, BR.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa em Hemoglobinopatias e Genetica das Doencas Hematologicas, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, BR.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa em Hemoglobinopatias e Genetica das Doencas Hematologicas, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, BR.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa em Hemoglobinopatias e Genetica das Doencas Hematologicas, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, BR.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190909,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,PMC6724462,,,2019/09/12 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322019000100263 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2019/e771 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2019;74:e771. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2019/e771.

GFI1 plays important roles in hematopoiesis, in particular by regulating both the function of hematopoietic stem- and precursor cells and differentiation along myeloid and lymphoid lineages. In recent years, a number of publications have provided evidence that GFI1 is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its proposed precursor, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and possibly also in the progression from MDS to AML. For instance, expression levels of the GFI1 gene correlate with patient survival and treatment response in both AML and MDS and can influence disease progression and maintenance in experimental animal models. Also, a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of GFI1, GFI1-36N, which encodes a variant GFI1 protein with a decreased efficiency to act as a transcriptional repressor, was found to be a prognostic factor for the development of AML and MDS. Both the GFI1-36N variant as well as reduced expression of the GFI1 gene lead to genome-wide epigenetic changes at sites where GFI1 occupies target gene promoters and enhancers. These epigenetic changes alter the response of leukemic cells to epigenetic drugs such as HDAC- or HAT inhibitors, indicating that GFI1 expression levels and genetic variants of GFI1 are of clinical relevance. Based on these and other findings, specific therapeutic approaches have been proposed to treat AML by targeting some of the epigenetic changes that occur as a consequence of GFI1 expression. Here, we will review the well-known role of Gfi1 as a transcription factor and describe the more recently discovered functions of GFI1 that are independent of DNA binding and how these might affect disease progression and the choice of epigenetic drugs for therapeutic regimens of AML and MDS.","['Moroy, Tarik', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus']","['Moroy T', 'Khandanpour C']",,"['Department of Hematopoiesis and Cancer, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190827,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6718700,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-acute myeloid leukemia', 'DNA repair', 'Gfi1', 'epigenetic abnormalities', 'metabolism', 'myelodyslastic syndromes']",2019/09/12 06:00,2019/09/12 06:01,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00824 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Aug 27;9:824. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00824. eCollection 2019.,,824,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there have been major advances in treatment approaches for childhood ALL, serious toxicities do occur but with significant inter-individual variability. The aim of this study is to measure the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) disposition in a combined cohort of Middle Eastern Children with ALL, and evaluate whether these polymorphisms predict 6-MP intolerance and toxicity during ALL maintenance therapy. Methods: The study includes children treated for ALL on two treatment protocols from two cohorts; one from Lebanon (N = 136) and another from Kurdistan province of Iran (N = 74). Genotyping for the following six candidate genetic polymorphisms: ITPA 94C > A (rs1127354) and IVS2+21A > C (rs7270101), TPMT*2 238G > C (rs1800462), TPMT*3B 460G > A (rs1800460) and *3C 719A > G (rs1142345), and NUDT15 415C > T (rs116855232) was performed and analyzed in association with 6-MP dose intensity and toxicity. Results: As expected, TPMT and NUDT15 variants were uncommon. As for ITPA, both polymorphisms were more common in the Lebanese as compared to the Kurdish cohort with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 for 94C > A and 0.14 for IVS2+21A > C in the Lebanese only (N = 121), and of 0.01 for either ITPA polymorphism in Kurds. The most significant toxic effects were depicted with the NUDT15 polymorphism with a median 6-MP dose intensity of 33.33%, followed by 46.65% for TPMT*3A polymorphism, followed by 65.33% for two ITPA risk allele carriers and 74% for one ITPA risk allele carriers, in comparison to a median of 100% for the homozygous wild type in the combined cohort (P < 0.001). In addition, the onset of febrile neutropenia was significantly higher in variant allele carriers in the combined cohorts. Conclusions: These data confirm the predictive role of TPMT, NUDT15, and ITPA in 6-MP intolerance in Middle Eastern children with ALL. Given the relatively high frequency of ITPA variants in our study and their significant association with 6-MP dose intensity, we recommend that physicians consider genotyping for ITPA variants in conjunction with TPMT and NUDT15 prior to 6-MP therapy in these children.","['Moradveisi, Borhan', 'Muwakkit, Samar', 'Zamani, Fatemeh', 'Ghaderi, Ebrahim', 'Mohammadi, Ebrahim', 'Zgheib, Nathalie K']","['Moradveisi B', 'Muwakkit S', 'Zamani F', 'Ghaderi E', 'Mohammadi E', 'Zgheib NK']",,"['Cancer and Immunology Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon."", 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Environmental Health Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190827,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC6718715,['NOTNLM'],"['ITPA', 'NUDT15', 'TPMT', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pharmacogenetics']",2019/09/12 06:00,2019/09/12 06:01,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00916 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Aug 27;10:916. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00916. eCollection 2019.,,916,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urine parameters including urine output and pH are important in order to minimize the risk of kidney injury, which increases adverse effects and hospital length of stay following HDMTX. IV sodium bicarbonate has been on shortage, and there are limited literature describing the safety of alternative regimens. Patients and methods: A single institution, prospective analysis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients receiving HDMTX for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or disease. Patients received an oral (PO) regimen of sodium bicarbonate and acetazolamide to achieve a urine pH >7. This cohort was compared to a subsequent IV sodium bicarbonate control cohort. Multiple co-primary safety outcomes assessed the incidences of acute kidney injury and delayed methotrexate clearance as well as change in liver function tests. Secondary outcomes included time to urine pH, time to urine output, and length of stay. Results: A total of 126 encounters were studied for the primary safety outcome. There was no difference between AKI incidence in patients receiving the PO alkalization regimen compared to patients receiving IV sodium bicarbonate (14.5% vs 9.3%, respectively, P=0.41). There was no difference in methotrexate clearance between the PO and IV groups (26.5% vs 37.2%, respectively, P=0.21). The use of PO alkalization regimen is estimated to have saved 2002 vials of IV sodium bicarbonate and was approximately US$226 less expensive per encounter. Conclusion: This analysis supports the use of PO regimens to achieve urine alkalization necessary for safe administration of HDMTX during periods of IV sodium bicarbonate shortage. Further studies may determine optimal dosing strategies that decrease length of stay and ensure noninferiority of efficacy outcomes with PO regimens for urine alkalization with HDMTX.","['Reed, Daniel R', 'Pierce, Eric J', 'Sen, Jeremy M', 'Keng, Michael K']","['Reed DR', 'Pierce EJ', 'Sen JM', 'Keng MK']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190830,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC6720153,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'alkalization', 'chemotherapy administration', 'high-dose methotrexate', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'oral alkalization']",2019/09/12 06:00,2019/09/12 06:01,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S190084 [doi]', '190084 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Aug 30;11:8065-8072. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S190084. eCollection 2019.,,8065-8072,,,,,"['Preliminary data for this manuscript have been published online in the abstract', 'only format (https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.15_suppl.e18804).', 'Dr Michael Keng is a member for the Advisory Board for Agios, outside the', 'submitted work.The authors report no other conflicts of interest in this work.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a young patient who had primary mediastinal mass and pleural effusion without bone marrow involvement. A CT-guided mediastinal biopsy and flow cytometry analysis of the pleural effusion revealed the blast cells to have complicated immunophenotypes: strongly expressed T-cell antigen CD7, myeloid-lineage antigens CD33 and CD13 and stem cell markers cTdT, CD34, and HLA-DR; dimly expressed myeloid-lineage specific antigen cMPO and B-cell antigen cCD79a; but did not express T-cell specific antigen cytoplasmic CD3 and B-cell specific antigen CD19. Clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement eventually determined the cell of origin from ETPs, not myeloblasts. The patient showed primary resistance to lymphoid and myeloid-directed induction therapy. Finally, low-dose decitabine combined with modified-CAG regimen induced a complete remission and allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed as consolidation. The case indicates a primary mediastinal neoplasm from ETP with distinctive immunophenotype from leukemia type. Low-dose decitabine and modified-CAG regimen in combination with allogeneic stem cell transplantation may improve the outcome of patient.","['Yang, Yuhuan', 'Yao, Shuna', 'Zhang, Jiuyang', 'Yan, Zheng', 'Chu, Junfeng', 'Wang, Haiying', 'Yao, Zhihua', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Xia, Qingxin', 'Liu, Yanyan']","['Yang Y', 'Yao S', 'Zhang J', 'Yan Z', 'Chu J', 'Wang H', 'Yao Z', 'Zhang F', 'Xia Q', 'Liu Y']",,"[""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190829,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6718739,['NOTNLM'],"['G-CSF priming', 'T-lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'decitabine', 'early T-cell precursor']",2019/09/12 06:00,2019/09/12 06:01,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S214905 [doi]', '214905 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Aug 29;12:7039-7044. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S214905. eCollection 2019.,,7039-7044,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used MarketScan commercial claims data (January 2011-June 2018) to identify patients with CML who newly initiated branded imatinib before 1 August 2015 or generic imatinib on or after 2 February 2016, and were continuously enrolled in health plans for 6 months before through 6 months following their initial fill. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we compared adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC]) and persistence (no gaps >/=30 and >/=60 consecutive days in therapy) to TKI therapy. RESULTS: Patients initiating generic imatinib consistently had higher average PDC per month and over the 6-month follow-up period than initiators of branded imatinib. Average 6-month PDC was 92% (95%CI:89%-94%) for generic initiators and 85% (95%CI:83%-86%) for brand initiators. Compared with branded imatinib initiators, a larger proportion of generic imatinib initiators were adherent and persistent to TKI therapy (PDC >/= 90%:78% versus 64%; no>/=60-day gap:94% versus 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients initiating generic imatinib achieved clinically significant improvements in adherence to TKI therapy relative to branded drug users, presumably due to lower out-of-pocket costs. Given the importance of optimal adherence in CML, considering barriers to adherence (eg, patient-cost sharing and health benefit design) when selecting initial treatment may improve long-term medication adherence. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies should consider how best to account for expected cost-sharing and its impact on adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes.","['Cole, Ashley L', 'Jazowski, Shelley A', 'Dusetzina, Stacie B']","['Cole AL', 'Jazowski SA', 'Dusetzina SB']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6765-8868', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3467-2502', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3907-9196']","['Division of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Cecil G.

Therefore, the effects of 5-Azacytidine (Aza) on clonal architecture and DNA methylation were investigated in this study. METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), 30 myeloid leukemia-associated genes were analyzed in 15 MDS/CMML patients with excellent response to Aza. Effects on methylation levels were analyzed by quantitative methylation analysis using pyrosequencing for the global methylation marker LINE-1 in patients and myeloid cell lines. Various myeloid cell lines and a healthy cohort were screened for methylation levels in 23 genes. Selected targets were verified on the MDS/CMML cohort. RESULTS: The study presented here showed a stable variant allele frequency and stable global methylation levels in responding patients. A significant demethylation of EZH2 and NOTCH1 was revealed in patients with Aza response. CONCLUSIONS: A response to Aza is not associated with eradication of malignant clones, but rather with a stabilization of the clonal architecture. We suggest changes in CpG methylation levels of EZH2 and NOTCH1 as potential targets of epigenetic response to Aza treatment which may also serve as useful biomarkers after clinical evaluation.","['Gawlitza, Anja L', 'Speith, Johanna', 'Rinke, Jenny', 'Sajzew, Roman', 'Muller, Elena K', 'Schafer, Vivien', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas']","['Gawlitza AL', 'Speith J', 'Rinke J', 'Sajzew R', 'Muller EK', 'Schafer V', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2147-489X'],"['Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Otto Schott Institute of Materials Research, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany. thomas.ernst@med.uni-jena.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190910,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-Azacytidine', 'Azacitidine', 'CpG methylation', 'EZH2', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'NOTCH1']",2019/09/12 06:00,2019/11/09 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-019-03016-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-019-03016-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2019 Nov;145(11):2835-2843. doi: 10.1007/s00432-019-03016-9.

This necessitates studying the mechanisms to maintain a stable expression of PML. However much less is known about the transcriptional regulation of PML, more so in the context of breast carcinoma. ERbeta has emerged as a critical factor in understanding breast cancer, especially since a huge proportion of breast cancers are ERalpha(-) and thus insensitive to tamoxifen therapy. This study aims to uncover an unidentified mechanism of PML gene regulation and its stabilization in breast cancer via ERbeta signalling and the impact on cellular apoptosis. We found that clinical expression of PML positively correlates with that of ERbeta both in normal and breast carcinoma samples and inversely correlates with markers of cellular proliferation, hinting towards a possible mechanistic interdependence. Both mRNA and protein expression of PML were increased in response to ERbeta overexpression on multiple human breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter assays and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that ERbeta can interact with the PML promoter via ERE and AP1 sites to enhance its transcription. ERbeta induced stable PML expression causes a decline of its target protein Survivin and simultaneously provides a stable docking platform leading to stabilisation of its target Foxo3a, further causing transcriptional upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors p21 and p27. Immunohistochemical analyses of cancer and normal breast tissues and functional assays conducted corroborated the findings. Collectively, our study identifies ERbeta signalling as a novel mechanism for PML gene regulation in ERalpha(-) breast cancer. It also reveals bi-directional downstream effect in which 'ERbeta-PML-(Foxo3a/Survivin)' network acts as a therapeutic axis by suppressing cellular survival and promoting cellular apoptosis in breast carcinoma.","['Datta, Neerajana', 'Islam, Saimul', 'Chatterjee, Uttara', 'Chatterjee, Sandip', 'Panda, Chinmay K', 'Ghosh, Mrinal K']","['Datta N', 'Islam S', 'Chatterjee U', 'Chatterjee S', 'Panda CK', 'Ghosh MK']",,"['Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB), TRUE Campus, CN-6, Sector-V, Salt Lake, Kolkata-700091 & 4, Raja S.C.

However, whether it affects the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in CML cells is still unknown. This study investigated the role of SNHG5 in CML and revealed the potential mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS K562 cells were transfected with shRNA, and the expression level of SNHG5 was assessd by quantitative RT-PCR. The proliferation ability was determined by CCK-8 assay. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expressions related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Cell apoptosis rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. The DNA methylation level was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS Our results show that inhibition of SNHG5 induced by RNA interference significantly inhibits K562 cells proliferation and induces cell differentiation with the increased expression of CD42b, CD11b, CD14, GATA-1, and ss-globin. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that inhibition of SNHG5 significantly induced cell apoptosis with decreased expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bax and cleaved capase-3. Additionally, Western blot and MSP analyses confirmed that inhibition of SNHG5 increased the expression of DR4 gene through suppressing its methylation. CONCLUSIONS Inhibition of SNHG5 suppressed K562 cell proliferation through inducing the differentiation and apoptosis by inhibiting methylation of DR4. Therefore, downregulated SNHG5 could play a key role in CML progression, and might provide a new strategy for the treatment of CML.","['Gao, Bing', 'Li, Song', 'Li, Guo']","['Gao B', 'Li S', 'Li G']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190911,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,PMC6753843,,,2019/09/12 06:00,2020/02/01 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['916661 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.916661 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Sep 11;25:6812-6819. doi: 10.12659/MSM.916661.,20200131,6812-6819,,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (long non-coding RNA SNHG5, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hexokinase-II (HK-II) is expressed predominantly in cancer cells, which promotes Warburg metabolic phenotype and protects the cancer cells from drug-induced apoptosis. The HK-II inhibitor 3- Bromopyruvate (3-BP) dissociates HK-II from mitochondrial complex, which leads to enhanced sensitization of leukemic cells to anti-leukemic drugs. In the present study, we analyzed the Warburg characteristics viz. HK-II expression, glucose uptake, endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) level of leukemic cell lines K-562 and THP-1 and then investigated if 3-BP can sensitize the leukemic cells K-562 to anti-leukemic drug Daunorubicin (DNR). We found that both K-562 and THP-1 cells have multi-fold high levels of HK-II, glucose uptake and endogenous ROS with respect to normal PBMCs. The combined treatment (CT) of 3-BP and DNR showed synergistic effect on the growth inhibition (GI) of K-562 and THP-1 cells. This growth inhibitory effect was attributed to 3-BP induced S-phase block and DNR induced G2/M block, resulted in reduced proliferation due to CT. Further, CT resulted in low HK-II level in mitochondrial fraction, high intracellular calcium and elevated apoptosis as compared with individual treatment of DNR and 3-BP. Moreover, CT caused enhanced DNA damage and hyperpolarized mitochondria, leading to cell death. Taken together, these results suggest that 3-BP synergises the anticancer effects of DNR in the chronic myeloid leukemic cell K-562, and may act as an effective adjuvant to anti-leukemic chemotherapy.","['Rai, Yogesh', 'Yadav, Priyanshu', 'Kumari, Neeraj', 'Kalra, Namita', 'Bhatt, Anant Narayan']","['Rai Y', 'Yadav P', 'Kumari N', 'Kalra N', 'Bhatt AN']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5157-9719'],"['Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi 110054, India.', 'Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi 110054, India.', 'Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi 110054, India.', 'Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi 110054, India.', 'Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi 110054, India anant@inmas.drdo.in anbhatt@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190924,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,PMC6757186,['NOTNLM'],"['*3-Bromopyruvate', '*Daunorubicin', '*Hexokinase-II', '*Leukemia', '*cell cycle']",2019/09/12 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20190880 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20190880 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 Sep 24;39(9). pii: BSR20190880. doi: 10.1042/BSR20190880.

Although immunosuppression is considered to originate within the lymph node (LN) microenvironment, alterations in T and natural killer (NK) cells have almost exclusively been studied in peripheral blood (PB). Whereas chemoimmunotherapy further deteriorates immune function, novel targeted agents like the B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax potentially spare nonmalignant lymphocytes; however, the effects of venetoclax on nonleukemic cells have not been explored. We address these unresolved issues using a comprehensive analysis of nonmalignant lymphocytes in paired LN and PB samples from untreated CLL patients, and by analyzing the effects of venetoclax-based treatment regimens on the immune system in PB samples from previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients. CLL-derived LNs contained twice the amount of suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CLL supportive follicular T helper (Tfh) cells compared with PB. This was accompanied by a low frequency of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The expression of PD-1 by CD8(+) T cells was significantly higher in LN compared with PB. Venetoclax-based treatment led to deep responses in the majority of patients, but also to decreased absolute numbers of B, T, and NK cells. Tfh cell, Treg, and PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cell numbers were reduced more than fivefold after venetoclax-based therapy, and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines was reduced. Furthermore, we observed restoration of NK cell function. These data support the notion that the immunosuppressive state in CLL is more prominent within the LN. Venetoclax-based regimens reduced the immunosuppressive footprint of CLL, suggesting immune recovery after the elimination of leukemic cells.","['de Weerdt, Iris', 'Hofland, Tom', 'de Boer, Renate', 'Dobber, Johan A', 'Dubois, Julie', 'van Nieuwenhuize, Denise', 'Mobasher, Mehrdad', 'de Boer, Fransien', 'Hoogendoorn, Mels', 'Velders, Gerjo A', 'van der Klift, Marjolein', 'Remmerswaal, Ester B M', 'Bemelman, Frederike J', 'Niemann, Carsten U', 'Kersting, Sabina', 'Levin, Mark-David', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Tonino, Sanne H', 'Kater, Arnon P']","['de Weerdt I', 'Hofland T', 'de Boer R', 'Dobber JA', 'Dubois J', 'van Nieuwenhuize D', 'Mobasher M', 'de Boer F', 'Hoogendoorn M', 'Velders GA', 'van der Klift M', 'Remmerswaal EBM', 'Bemelman FJ', 'Niemann CU', 'Kersting S', 'Levin MD', 'Eldering E', 'Tonino SH', 'Kater AP']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4694-6048', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3253-8759', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3190-1891']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.', 'Internal Medicine, Ikazia Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Internal Medicine, Medical Center Leeuwarden, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Gelderse Vallei Hospital, Ede, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Amphia Hospital, Breda, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Renal Transplant Unit, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Haga Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, and.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6737416,,,2019/09/12 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000360 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000360 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Sep 10;3(17):2642-2652. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000360.,20200903,2642-2652,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Blood/*immunology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*drug effects', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sulfonamides/*immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 940 children who were newly diagnosed with ALL were enrolled in this study. The children were treated with the CCLG-ALL2008 regimen. A retrospective analysis was performed for the long-term outcome of ALL children with different molecular biological features. RESULTS: Among the 940 children with ALL, there were 570 boys and 370 girls, with a median age of onset of 5 years (range 1-15 years) and a median follow-up time of 65 months (range 3-123 months). The complete response (CR) rate was 96.7%, the predicted 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was 76.5%+/-1.5%, and the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 62.6%+/-3.0%. After CR was achieved after treatment, the overall recurrence rate was 21.9%. The children with positive ETV6-RUNX1 had the lowest recurrence rate and were prone to late recurrence, and those with positive MLL rearrangement had the highest recurrence rate and were prone to early recurrence. The children with positive ETV6-RUNX1 had a significantly higher predicted 10-year OS rate than those with positive TCF3-PBX1, BCR-ABL, or MLL rearrangement and those without molecular biological features (P<0.05). The children with positive ETV6-RUNX1 had a significantly higher predicted 10-year EFS rate than those with positive BCR-ABL or MLL rearrangement (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular biological features may affect the long-term prognosis of children with ALL, and positive MLL rearrangement and BCR-ABL fusion gene are indicators of poor prognosis. Children with positive ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene have the highest long-term survival rate.","['Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Zou, Yao', 'Liu, Xiao-Ming', 'Yang, Wen-Yu', 'Guo, Ye', 'Ruan, Min', 'Liu, Fang', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Zhang, Li', 'Wang, Shu-Chun', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Chen XJ', 'Zou Y', 'Liu XM', 'Yang WY', 'Guo Y', 'Ruan M', 'Liu F', 'Chen YM', 'Zhang L', 'Wang SC', 'Zhu XF']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China. xfzhu1981@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,PMC7390250,,,2019/09/12 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2019/09/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2019.09.009 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Sep;21(9):890-893.,20190917,890-893,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The F0 rats were exposed to 5 mg/kg PFOS and SAM or DAC until PND60. The development of the offsprings were monitored without PFOS exposure. The fertility in F0, F1 rats, and change in F1 testes were observed. The results were as follows. The significant increase in F0 pregnancy rate, and survival rate in F1 offspring in PFOS + SAM relative to PFOS group were observed. Changes of birth weights and physical development in F1 offspring with SAM were approached as a corresponding variation of the control after the deparation period. No pregnant in F1 maternal rats in the PFOS and DAC groups were found, but pregnant in the SAM group. Significantly decrease in the percentage of abnormal seminiferous tubules and increase in expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF+) spermatogonial stem cells in F1 testis compared with the PFOS group. Taken together, Methyl donor SAM improve PLZF + spermatogonia stem cell proliferation, attenuate damage in testicular tissue structure, which subsequently improve the transgenerational growth retard and infertility induced by PFOS chronic stress.","['Tian, Jianying', 'Xu, Haiming', 'Zhang, Yawen', 'Shi, Xinchen', 'Wang, Wencheng', 'Gao, Huanmin', 'Bi, Yongyi']","['Tian J', 'Xu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Shi X', 'Wang W', 'Gao H', 'Bi Y']",,"['Department of Health, Labor Health and Environment, School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430068, Hubei, China; Basic Medical School, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'School of Public Health and Management, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Basic Medical School, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'School of Public Health and Management, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', ""Department of Neurology, People's Hospital of Ningxia, Yinchuan, 750002, Ningxia, China."", ""Department of Neurology, People's Hospital of Ningxia, Yinchuan, 750002, Ningxia, China."", 'Department of Health, Labor Health and Environment, School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430068, Hubei, China.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and erythropoietin (EPO) promote the recovery from SCI, but the relationship between apoptosis and the combination therapeutic effect is not completely clear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of HBO and EPO on SCI and the mechanisms that underlie their therapeutic benefits. DESIGN: The study was designed to explore the effects of HBO and EPO on SCI through a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty young developing female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into groups of 12 rats receiving sham, SCI, HBO, EPO, or HBO plus EPO. The SCI model was modified with the Allen method to better control consistency. HBO was performed for 1 hour per day for a total of 21 days, and EPO was given once per week for a total of 3 weeks. Both methods were performed 2 hours after SCI. Locomotor function was evaluated with the 21-point Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale, an inclined-plane test, and a footprint analysis. All genes were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The level of cell apoptosis was determined by Hoechst staining. RESULTS: The results showed that HBO and EPO promoted the recovery of locomotor function in the hind limbs of rats by inhibiting the apoptosis of neurons. During this period, the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 protein (Bcl-2) increased significantly, whereas the expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved caspase 3 decreased significantly, indicating the inhibition of apoptosis. Meanwhile, the expression of G protein-coupled receptor 17 decreased, and that of myelin basic protein increased, suggesting that there may be a potential connection between demyelination and neuronal apoptosis. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the study include deviations in the preparation of SCI models; lack of reverse validation of molecular mechanisms; absence of in vitro cell experiments; and only one time point after SCI was studied. CONCLUSIONS: HBO and EPO treatments are beneficial for SCI, especially when the 2 therapies are combined.","['Zhou, Yue', 'Su, Peng', 'Pan, Zhenzhen', 'Liu, Dong', 'Niu, Yanping', 'Zhu, Weiqing', 'Yao, Pengfei', 'Song, Yue', 'Sun, Yongming']","['Zhou Y', 'Su P', 'Pan Z', 'Liu D', 'Niu Y', 'Zhu W', 'Yao P', 'Song Y', 'Sun Y']",,"[""Department of Orthopedics, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, China; Department of Orthopedics and The Experimental Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', ""Department of Radiology, People's Hospital of Changshan, Quzhou, China."", 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 1055 Sanxiang Road, Suzhou 215004, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Phys Ther,Physical therapy,0022623,,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['5558220 [pii]', '10.1093/ptj/pzz125 [doi]']",ppublish,Phys Ther. 2019 Dec 16;99(12):1679-1689. doi: 10.1093/ptj/pzz125.,20200319,1679-1689,['(c) 2019 American Physical Therapy Association.'],"['0 (Bcl2 protein, rat)', '0 (GPR17 protein, rat)', '0 (Mbp protein, rat)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hyperbaric Oxygenation', 'Locomotion', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Recovery of Function', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/metabolism/*therapy', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we describe a 79-year-old Korean female patient with MDS-excess blasts (MDS-EB) that evolved into acute leukemia; the blasts simultaneously expressed B-lymphoid and myeloid antigens. The patient was diagnosed with MDS-EB with blasts of myeloid lineage coexpressing a few B-lymphoid antigens with 7q and 20q abnormalities. The disease progressed to acute leukemia with blasts carrying more B-lymphoid antigens, which was immunophenotypically compatible with B-lymphoid/myeloid acute leukemia. Unlike previously reported patients whose blast populations are bilineal, our patient is the first with biphenotypic acute leukemia that progressed from MDS. The diagnosis of our patient introduces the possibility that many other types of biphenotypic acute leukemia may have gone undiagnosed and encourages hematologists to designate a specific diagnostic category for this type of disease, so that it can more readily be detected and studied in the future.","['Kim, Miyoung', 'Zang, Dae Young', 'Lee, Jiwon', 'Park, Ji-Young', 'Chung, Yousun', 'Lee, Young Kyung']","['Kim M', 'Zang DY', 'Lee J', 'Park JY', 'Chung Y', 'Lee YK']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Lab Med,Laboratory medicine,0250641,,['NOTNLM'],"['bilineal', 'biphenotypic', 'flow cytometry', 'immunohistochemistry', 'mixed phenotype acute leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['5556794 [pii]', '10.1093/labmed/lmz054 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Med. 2020 May 6;51(3):288-295. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmz054.,20201211,288-295,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2019.

As a complication of cytotoxic regimens, breast cancer patients are at risk for therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs). These t-MNs are commonly refractory to antileukemic therapies and result in poor patient outcomes. We previously demonstrated that somatic mutations in leukemia-related genes are present in the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILeuks) of a subset of early breast cancers. Here, we performed genomic analysis of microdissected breast cancer tumor cells and TILeuks from seven breast cancer patients who subsequently developed leukemia. In four patients, mutations present in the leukemia were detected in breast cancer TILeuks. This finding suggests that TILeuks in the primary breast cancer may harbor the ancestor of the future leukemogenic clone. Additional research is warranted to ascertain whether infiltrating mutant TILeuks could constitute a biomarker for the development of t-MN and to determine the functional consequences of mutant TILeuks.","['Comen, Elizabeth A', 'Bowman, Robert L', 'Selenica, Pier', 'Kleppe, Maria', 'Farnoud, Noushin R', 'Pareja, Fresia', 'Weigelt, Britta', 'Hill, Corinne E', 'Alon, Abigail', 'Geyer, Felipe C', 'Akturk, Guray', 'Reis-Filho, Jorge S', 'Norton, Larry', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Comen EA', 'Bowman RL', 'Selenica P', 'Kleppe M', 'Farnoud NR', 'Pareja F', 'Weigelt B', 'Hill CE', 'Alon A', 'Geyer FC', 'Akturk G', 'Reis-Filho JS', 'Norton L', 'Levine RL']",,"['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Precision Pathology Biobanking Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Letter', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,PMC7690564,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['5555367 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djz157 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2020 Jan 1;112(1):107-110. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djz157.,20200810,107-110,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

A library of synthetic oligonucleotides assaying each allele five times was transfected into K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphoblasts and SK-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. One hundred forty eight variants showed allelic differences in K562 and 53 in SK-SY5Y cells, on average 2.6 variants per locus. Nine showed significant differences in both lines, a modest overlap reflecting different regulatory landscapes of these lines that also differ significantly in chromatin marks. Eight of nine were in the same direction. We observe no preference for risk alleles to increase or decrease expression. We find a positive correlation between the number of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium and the proportion of functional SNPs supporting combinatorial effects that may lead to haplotype selection.

From a database of 10 369 180 compounds, we identified 85 021 natural product-derived phenolic fragments, which were virtually O-phosphorylated and screened for in silico binding to the STAT3 SH2 domain. Nine screening hits were then synthesized, eight of which showed a degree of in vitro inhibition of STAT3. After analysis of its selectivity profile, the most potent inhibitor was then developed to Stafia-1, the first small molecule shown to preferentially inhibit the STAT family member STAT5a over the close homologue STAT5b. A phosphonate prodrug based on Stafia-1 inhibited STAT5a with selectivity over STAT5b in human leukemia cells, providing the first demonstration of selective in vitro and intracellular inhibition of STAT5a by a small-molecule inhibitor.","['Natarajan, Kalaiselvi', 'Muller-Klieser, Daniel', 'Rubner, Stefan', 'Berg, Thorsten']","['Natarajan K', 'Muller-Klieser D', 'Rubner S', 'Berg T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3109-7696'],"['Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['BE 4572/4-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'INST 268/281-1 FUGG/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'European Union and the Free State of Saxony, European Regional Development Fund']",['Journal Article'],20191127,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,PMC6973011,['NOTNLM'],"['SH2 domains', 'biological activity', 'inhibitors', 'protein-protein interactions', 'transcription factors']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/01/09 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/chem.201904147 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2020 Jan 2;26(1):148-154. doi: 10.1002/chem.201904147.

However, few reports have described the changes in the isohemagglutinin titers and the characteristics in patients with recurrent hematologic conditions after ABO-incompatible HSCT. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old female with acute erythroid leukemia received a peripheral blood stem cell transplant from her HLA-haploidentical daughter. The patient was typed as group O with anti- A (4+) and B (4+) isohemagglutinins, while the donor was typed as group B. The bone marrow cells achieved complete donor cell chimerism on Day 13 after HSCT. On Day 120, the patient showed 97% B RBC type with persistent anti-A (3+) and without anti-B antibodies. On Day 375, her leukemia relapsed, and recipient type O RBCs and anti-B antibodies sequentially reemerged. However, clinicolaboratory hemolysis and erythroid aplasia were not detected in the patient. RESULTS: The post-HSCT sera agglutinated the allo B RBCs, but not the donor B RBCs, while the pre-HSCT sera agglutinated both RBCs. The burst-forming/colony-forming units of erythroid formation from the donor peripheral blood stem cells were impaired by only the pre-HSCT sera and not by the post-HSCT sera. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the characteristic changes of isohemagglutinins between the pre- and post-HSCT sera in a patient with recurrent acute myeloid leukemia. The present study suggests that the plasma cells producing anti-donor B RBCs in the patient have been selectively eliminated or induced into an anergic state by the post-HSCT immunologic reconstruction.","['Tajima, Katsushi', 'Takizawa, Kazuya', 'Yasuda, Takeshi', 'Tsumanuma, Riko', 'Okuyama, Shuhei', 'Kumagai, Hiroaki', 'Omoto, Eijiro', 'Okumura, Wataru']","['Tajima K', 'Takizawa K', 'Yasuda T', 'Tsumanuma R', 'Okuyama S', 'Kumagai H', 'Omoto E', 'Okumura W']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3017-4530'],"['Department of Hematology, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yamagata Prefectural Central Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20190910,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15510 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2019 Nov;59(11):3319-3323. doi: 10.1111/trf.15510.

RECENT FINDINGS: The European LeukemiaNet MRD Working Party recently published guidelines to help standardize testing, utilizing flow cytometry and molecular techniques. The timing of MRD assessments, choice of assay and cutoff of for reporting positive results are all important. Patients known to be MRD-positive pretransplantation have a poor prognosis and consideration should be given to selecting a myeloablative regimen over a reduced intensity regimen (if appropriate) and offering posttransplantation maintenance therapy. SUMMARY: It may be best to think of MRD as a dynamic variable, where a rising MRD result is more specific and highly predictive of relapse. It is unclear how MRD results should impact the timing of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, if at all. There are currently no published randomized studies to help guide the practitioner in this situation, hence decision-making should be individualized.","['Fasan, Omotayo']",['Fasan O'],,"['Hematology, Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Novant Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000543 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Nov;26(6):413-420. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000543.,20200803,413-420,,,IM,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Postoperative Care', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet the contributions of respiratory adverse events (AEs) within this population are poorly understood. Furthermore, the roles of fluid overload (FO) and infection in AML pulmonary complications have been inadequately examined. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence, categories, and grades of respiratory AEs and to assess the associations of FO and infection on respiratory AE development in childhood AML induction. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the induction courses of a cohort of de novo pediatric AML patients for any NCI CTCAE grade 2 to 5 respiratory AE, FO, and systemic/pulmonary infection occurrence. Demographic, disease, and treatment-related data were abstracted. Descriptive, univariate, survival, and multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Among 105 eligible subjects from 2009 to 2016, 49.5% (n = 52) experienced 63 discrete respiratory AEs. FO occurred in 28.6% of subjects (n = 30), with half occurring within 24 hours of hospitalization. Positive FO status < 10 days (aHR 5.5, 95% CI 2.3-12.8), >/= 10 days (aHR 13, 95% CI 4.1-41.8), and positive infection status >/= 10 days into treatment (aHR 14.9, 5.4-41.6) were each independently associated with AE development. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a higher incidence of respiratory AEs during childhood AML induction than previously illustrated. FO occurs frequently and early in this course. Late infections and FO at any time frame were strongly associated with AE development. Interventions focused on the prevention and management of FO and infectious respiratory complications could be instrumental in reducing preventable treatment-related morbidity and mortality.","['Miller, Lane H', 'Keller, Frank', 'Mertens, Ann', 'Klein, Mitchel', 'Allen, Kristen', 'Castellino, Sharon', 'Woods, William G']","['Miller LH', 'Keller F', 'Mertens A', 'Klein M', 'Allen K', 'Castellino S', 'Woods WG']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1995-9492'],"[""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.""]",['eng'],"['UL1 TR002378/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR002378/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190910,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC6803045,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*adverse', '*fluid', '*induction', '*infection', '*respiratory']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27975 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Dec;66(12):e27975. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27975.

In February 2016, a generic formulation entered the US market. Physicians and patients are frequently concerned about whether switching from original to generic drugs may affect the efficacy and/or safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study using medical charts of patients diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase who were treated with original imatinib from the year 2000 to 2017 and who were subsequently switched to generic imatinib. RESULTS: In this study, 38 patients have switched to generic imatinib. Before the switch, responses were assessed on all patients, all of them were in CCyR and 36 (95%) were in MMR, including 28 (74%) with MR4.5. Patients have received generic imatinib for a median of 19.4 (range, 3.4-46.3) months. Molecular responses after switching were stable in 89%, improved in 8%, and worsened in 3% of patients. After switching, 15 (39%) patients reported new or worsening adverse events, including 5 (13%) patients with edema, 8 (21%) muscle cramps, 7 (18%) nausea, 6 (16%) diarrhea, and 5 (13%) fatigue. DISCUSSION: Bioequivalence studies demonstrated the same rate and extent of absorption of generic imatinib compared to the original form, which led to the FDA approval. In our observational series, most of the patients maintained their responses and none lost MMR. Adverse events noted were mild and well tolerated. CONCLUSION: A change from original to generic imatinib appears to maintain efficacy and be generally safe. More patients and longer follow-up are required to confirm these observations.","['Abou Dalle, Iman', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Burger, Jan', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Abou Dalle I', 'Kantarjian H', 'Burger J', 'Estrov Z', 'Ohanian M', 'Verstovsek S', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E', 'Cortes J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6520-9134', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1623-3613']","['Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190910,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6825993,['NOTNLM'],"['*bioequivalence', '*generic', '*imatinib', '*leukemia', '*safety']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2545 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Nov;8(15):6559-6565. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2545.

This study described reported menstrual patterns and the agreement between respondent-reported and biochemical premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in this population. PROCEDURE: This was a cross-sectional study of survivors (or their parent proxy) aged 13-21.9 years who received gonadotoxic therapy and were enrolled in a longitudinal health survey. Participants reported menstrual regularity, hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) use, and ovarian dysfunction. Respondent-reported POI was defined as the survivor taking HRT for ovarian failure or having been told she had ovarian failure. Biochemical POI was defined as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level >/=40 mIU/mL. The agreement between respondent-reported and biochemical POI was determined using Cohen's kappa coefficient (kappa) and analyzed by demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Among 182 AYA-aged survivors (72.5% non-Hispanic White, 46.7% leukemia survivors), 14.8% reported requiring HRT to have menses but 55.5% reported regular menses without HRT use. Among survivors with FSH measurements (n = 130), 17.7% reported POI whereas 18.5% had FSH >/=40 mIU/mL (kappa = 0.66, sensitivity 70.8%, specificity 94.3%). The highest agreement between respondent-reported and biochemical POI was with young adult self-report (kappa = 0.78) and survivors with >5 survivor clinic (kappa = 0.83) and/or >5 endocrinologist (kappa = 1.00) visits. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of AYA-aged survivors reported having regular menses without HRT support. The accuracy of respondent-reported POI increased with repeated survivor clinic or endocrinologist visits, highlighting the importance of continued education. Survivors must be informed about their ovarian function to enable them to advocate for their reproductive health.","['George, Sobenna A', 'Williamson Lewis, Rebecca', 'McKenzie, Laurie', 'Cherven, Brooke', 'Patterson, Briana C', 'Effinger, Karen E', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Meacham, Lillian R']","['George SA', 'Williamson Lewis R', 'McKenzie L', 'Cherven B', 'Patterson BC', 'Effinger KE', 'Mertens AC', 'Meacham LR']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8937-0777', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0989-0962']","['Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190910,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent', '*cancer survivorship', '*premature ovarian insufficiency']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27981 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Dec;66(12):e27981. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27981.

Withdrawal syndrome was significantly more common in patients who have been taking tyrosine kinase inhibitors for a longer time and in patients of older age and with lower body weight. In patients with withdrawal syndrome, the total production of mesenchymal stromal cells and expression of FGFR2 and MMP2 genes were significantly lower; loss of deep molecular response was also less frequent in this group of patients. At the same time, the expression of genes important for the maintenance of stem cells (SOX9, PDGFRa, and LIF) was significantly lower in the mesenchymal stromal cells of patients with withdrawal syndrome and loss of deep molecular response. We observed a clear-cut relationship between the development of withdrawal syndrome and the loss of deep molecular response. The decrease in the expression of FGFR2 and MMP2 genes in the mesenchymal stromal cells of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia before discontinuation of treatment can be a predictor of withdrawal syndrome, while simultaneous decrease in the expression of SOX9, PDGFRa, and LIF in these cells attests to undesirability of therapy discontinuation at the moment.","['Petinati, N A', 'Petrova, A N', 'Chelysheva, E Yu', 'Shukhov, O A', 'Bykova, A V', 'Nemchenko, I S', 'Sats, N V', 'Turkina, A G', 'Drize, N I']","['Petinati NA', 'Petrova AN', 'Chelysheva EY', 'Shukhov OA', 'Bykova AV', 'Nemchenko IS', 'Sats NV', 'Turkina AG', 'Drize NI']",,"['National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Medical Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia. loel@mail.ru.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190909,United States,Bull Exp Biol Med,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,0372557,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'molecular relapse', 'multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells', 'relative level of gene expression', 'withdrawal syndrome']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10517-019-04575-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10517-019-04575-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Bull Exp Biol Med. 2019 Aug;167(4):580-583. doi: 10.1007/s10517-019-04575-0.

In clinical trials, however, idelalisib was associated with rare, but potentially serious liver and lung toxicities. In this study, we used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population to identify genetic factors associated with the drug response that may inform risk management strategies for idelalisib in humans. Eight male mice (4 matched pairs) from 50 CC lines were treated once daily for 14 days by oral gavage with either vehicle or idelalisib at a dose selected to achieve clinically relevant peak plasma concentrations (150 mg/kg/day). The drug was well tolerated across all CC lines, and there were no observations of overt liver injury. Differences across CC lines were seen in drug concentration in plasma samples collected at the approximate Tmax on study Days 1, 7, and 14. There were also small but statistically significant treatment-induced alterations in plasma total bile acids and microRNA-122, and these may indicate early hepatocellular stress required for immune-mediated hepatotoxicity in humans. Idelalisib treatment further induced significant elevations in the total cell count of terminal bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which may be analogous to pneumonitis observed in the clinic. Genetic mapping identified loci associated with interim plasma idelalisib concentration and the other 3 treatment-related endpoints. Thirteen priority candidate quantitative trait genes identified in CC mice may now guide interrogation of risk factors for adverse drug responses associated with idelalisib in humans.","['Mosedale, Merrie', 'Cai, Yanwei', 'Eaddy, John Scott', 'Corty, Robert W', 'Nautiyal, Manisha', 'Watkins, Paul B', 'Valdar, William']","['Mosedale M', 'Cai Y', 'Eaddy JS', 'Corty RW', 'Nautiyal M', 'Watkins PB', 'Valdar W']",,"['Institute for Drug Safety Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599.', 'Institute for Drug Safety Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Department of Genetics.', 'Institute for Drug Safety Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Department of Genetics.', 'Institute for Drug Safety Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Institute for Drug Safety Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599.', 'Department of Genetics.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM127000/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,PMC6876541,['NOTNLM'],"['*Collaborative Cross', '*drug-induced liver injury', '*idelalisib', '*precision medicine', '*toxicogenetics']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/08/22 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['5566503 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfz199 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2019 Dec 1;172(2):265-278. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfz199.,20200821,265-278,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Prediction of kinship from RNA-seq data would be useful for confirming the expected relationships in family based studies and for highlighting samples from related individuals in case-control or population based studies. Currently, reconstruction of pedigrees is largely based on SNPs or microsatellites, obtained from genotyping arrays, whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing. Potential problems with using RNA-seq data for kinship detection are the low proportion of the genome that it covers, the highly skewed coverage of exons of different genes depending on expression level and allele-specific expression. In this study we assess the use of RNA-seq data to detect kinship between individuals, through pairwise identity by descent (IBD) estimates. First, we obtained high quality SNPs after successive filters to minimize the effects due to allelic imbalance as well as errors in sequencing, mapping and genotyping. Then, we used these SNPs to calculate pairwise IBD estimates. By analysing both real and simulated RNA-seq data we show that it is possible to identify up to second degree relationships using RNA-seq data of even low to moderate sequencing depth.","['Blay, Natalia', 'Casas, Eduard', 'Galvan-Femenia, Ivan', 'Graffelman, Jan', 'de Cid, Rafael', 'Vavouri, Tanya']","['Blay N', 'Casas E', 'Galvan-Femenia I', 'Graffelman J', 'de Cid R', 'Vavouri T']",,"['Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Masters Programme in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), Barcelona 08035, Spain.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Doctoral Programme in Biomedicine, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona 08007, Spain.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Genomes for Life - GCAT lab Group - Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute, Can Ruti Campus, Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain.', 'Department of Statistics and Operations Research Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona 08028, Spain.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105-946, USA.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Genomes for Life - GCAT lab Group - Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute, Can Ruti Campus, Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona 08916, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,PMC6868348,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['5566588 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkz776 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2019 Dec 2;47(21):e136. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkz776.,20200511,e136,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Clinical manifestations differ from general population as well as clinical approach, diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this work is to describe clinical characteristics, diagnostic approach, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases that presented with neutropenia and fever associated with acute cholecystitis in a tertiary referral hospital. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with diagnosis of neutropenia and fever associated with acute cholecystitis in the period between January 2000 and January 2017. Quantitative variables were analyzed with mean and standard deviation, and qualitative variables with frequency and percentage. Results: During the study period, 2007 patients presented with neutropenia and fever. Twelve of them (0.59%) had associated acute cholecystitis. The most common hematologic disease among these patients was lymphoblastic leukemia. Acute acalculous cholecystitis was diagnosed in 6 cases (50%). Eleven patients (91.6%) had a severe presentation and cholecystostomy was performed in 9 (75%) cases. The main cause of mortality was septic shock (33.3%).

Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, myeloproliferative disorder, and scleroderma with pulmonary fibrosis complications show megakaryocyte infiltration in the lung. In this study, we demonstrated that the number of CD41(+) megakaryocytes increased in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis tissues through the Chemokine (CXCmotif) ligand 12/Chemokine receptor 4 (CXCL12/CXCR4) axis. Pharmacological inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis with WZ811 prevented migration of CD41(+) megakaryocytes induced by BLM-injured lung tissue ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, WZ811 significantly attenuated lung fibrosis after BLM challenge. Moreover, megakaryocytes directly promoted fibroblast proliferation and trans-differentiation to myofibroblasts. We conclude that thrombopoietin (TPO) activated megakaryocytes through transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway to promote fibroblast proliferation and trans-differentiation to myofibroblasts, which is abolished by treatment with selective TGF-betaR-1/ALK5 inhibitors. Therefore, CD41(+) megakaryocytes migrate to injured lung tissue partially through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to promote the proliferation and trans-differentiation of fibroblasts through direct contact and the TGF-beta1 pathway.","['Zhou, Yan', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Li, Chen', 'Huang, XiaoTing', 'Cheng, HaiPeng', 'Bao, XingWen', 'Zhao, FeiYan', 'Cheng, QingMei', 'Yue, ShaoJie', 'Han, JianZhong', 'Luo, ZiQiang']","['Zhou Y', 'Zhang B', 'Li C', 'Huang X', 'Cheng H', 'Bao X', 'Zhao F', 'Cheng Q', 'Yue S', 'Han J', 'Luo Z']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3808-6159'],"['Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Urology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Changzhi medical college, Changzhi, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China. hjzjames@163.com.', 'Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China. luoziqiang@csu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190909,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC6733875,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1903-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1903-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Sep 9;10(9):648. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1903-8.,20200911,648,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Bleomycin/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*chemically induced/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the cellular manifestations of these breaks that link these mechanisms to cell death, and we further tested the relevance of DNA repair pathways in protection of cells against CNDAC damage. The present investigations demonstrate that following exposure to CNDAC and a wash into drug-free medium, chromosomal aberrations, DNA strand breaks, and multinucleate cells arose. These portended loss of viability and were dependent upon exposure time, CNDAC concentration, and passage through mitosis. Following a pulse incubation with CNDAC, live cell imaging using GFP-tagged histone H2B as a marker demonstrated a normal rate of progression to mitosis, but a concentration-dependent delay in passage to a second mitosis. Progression through mitosis was also delayed and accompanied by formation of multinucleate cells. CNDAC-treated cells lacking XPF-ERCC1 nuclease function showed a 16-fold increase in chromosome aberrations. Chromosomal damage in Rad51D-mutant cells (homologous recombination repair deficient) were even more severely affected with extensive aberrations. Rodent or human Polq (POLQ) mutant cells, defective in Pol theta-mediated alternative end joining, did not show enhanced cellular sensitivity to CNDAC. These findings are consistent with formation of DSBs in the second S-phase following exposure, resulting in chromosome aberrations, aberrant mitoses, and subsequent apoptosis.","['Liu, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Yingjun', 'Takata, Kei-Ichi', 'Nowak, Billie', 'Liu, Chaomei', 'Wood, Richard D', 'Hittelman, Walter N', 'Plunkett, William']","['Liu X', 'Jiang Y', 'Takata KI', 'Nowak B', 'Liu C', 'Wood RD', 'Hittelman WN', 'Plunkett W']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0048-6640', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9311-2164']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. wplunket@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA193124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190909,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC7433019,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-18-1380 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1380 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Dec;18(12):2283-2295. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1380.

Beyond this mitochondrial function, several Bcl-2 family members have emerged as critical modulators of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and dynamics, showing proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions. Bcl-2 family proteins specifically target several intracellular Ca(2+)-transport systems, including organellar Ca(2+) channels: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), Ca(2+)-release channels mediating Ca(2+) flux from the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which mediate Ca(2+) flux across the mitochondrial outer membrane into the mitochondria. Although the formation of protein complexes between Bcl-2 proteins and these channels has been extensively studied, a major advance during recent years has been elucidating the complex interaction of Bcl-2 proteins with IP3Rs. Distinct interaction sites for different Bcl-2 family members were identified in the primary structure of IP3Rs. The unique molecular profiles of these Bcl-2 proteins may account for their distinct functional outcomes when bound to IP3Rs. Furthermore, Bcl-2 inhibitors used in cancer therapy may affect IP3R function as part of their proapoptotic effect and/or as an adverse effect in healthy cells.","['Ivanova, Hristina', 'Vervliet, Tim', 'Monaco, Giovanni', 'Terry, Lara E', 'Rosa, Nicolas', 'Baker, Mariah R', 'Parys, Jan B', 'Serysheva, Irina I', 'Yule, David I', 'Bultynck, Geert']","['Ivanova H', 'Vervliet T', 'Monaco G', 'Terry LE', 'Rosa N', 'Baker MR', 'Parys JB', 'Serysheva II', 'Yule DI', 'Bultynck G']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Structural Biology Imaging Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Structural Biology Imaging Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM072804/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS106968/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE014756/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200401,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,101513680,PMC7111250,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['cshperspect.a035089 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a035089 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2020 Apr 1;12(4). pii: cshperspect.a035089. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a035089.,20210802,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (VDAC1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 1.6.- (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,['2022/04/01 00:00']

We used gene expression profiling, cytokine/chemokine quantification, flow cytometry, and a variety of imaging techniques to show that MSCs, directly isolated from the primary bone marrow specimens of patients with ALL, frequently adopted an activated, cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype. Normal, primary human MSCs and the MSC cell line HS27a both were activated de novo, when exposed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing chemotherapy agents cytarabine (AraC) and daunorubicin (DNR), a phenomenon blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Chemotherapy-activated HS27a cells were functionally evaluated in a coculture model with ALL targets. Activated MSCs prevented therapy-induced apoptosis and death in ALL targets, via mitochondrial transfer through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). Reduction of mitochondrial transfer by selective mitochondrial depletion or interference with TNT formation by microtubule inhibitors, such as vincristine (VCR), prevented the ""rescue"" function of activated MSCs. Corticosteroids, also a mainstay of ALL therapy, prevented the activation of MSCs. We also demonstrated that AraC (but not VCR) induced activation of MSCs, mitochondrial transfer, and mitochondrial mass increase in a murine NSG model of disseminated SEM cell-derived ALL, wherein CD19+ cells closely associated with nestin+ MSCs after AraC, but not in the other conditions. Our data propose a readily clinically exploitable mechanism for improving treatment of ALL, in which traditional ROS-inducing chemotherapies are often ineffective at eradicating residual disease, despite efficiently killing the bulk population.","['Burt, Richard', 'Dey, Aditi', 'Aref, Sarah', 'Aguiar, Melanie', 'Akarca, Ayse', 'Bailey, Katharine', 'Day, William', 'Hooper, Steven', 'Kirkwood, Amy', 'Kirschner, Kristina', 'Lee, Soo-Wah', 'Lo Celso, Cristina', 'Manji, Jiten', 'Mansour, Marc R', 'Marafioti, Teresa', 'Mitchell, Rachel J', 'Muirhead, Robert C', 'Cheuk Yan Ng, Kenton', 'Pospori, Constandina', 'Puccio, Ignazio', 'Zuborne-Alapi, Krisztina', 'Sahai, Erik', 'Fielding, Adele K']","['Burt R', 'Dey A', 'Aref S', 'Aguiar M', 'Akarca A', 'Bailey K', 'Day W', 'Hooper S', 'Kirkwood A', 'Kirschner K', 'Lee SW', 'Lo Celso C', 'Manji J', 'Mansour MR', 'Marafioti T', 'Mitchell RJ', 'Muirhead RC', 'Cheuk Yan Ng K', 'Pospori C', 'Puccio I', 'Zuborne-Alapi K', 'Sahai E', 'Fielding AK']",,"['Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'The Sir Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom; and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'The Sir Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'The Sir Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'Department of Haematology and.', 'The Sir Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology and.']",['eng'],"['9609/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'CRUK/09/006 /CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A20937/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C27995/A21019 /CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6856969,,,2019/09/11 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)74026-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001398 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Oct 24;134(17):1415-1429. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001398.,20200217,1415-1429,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Anthracyclines cause cardiotoxicity; however, there is a paucity of data reflecting the risk of cardiotoxicity in the acute myeloid leukemia population, and risk factors for development of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are not well established in this population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy between March 2011 and August 2017 was performed. Baseline and all additional cardiac monitoring within one year of induction were collected. Home medications and new medication initiation were determined via the electronic health record and new outpatient prescriptions. RESULTS: Of 97 evaluable patients, 25 (25.8%) developed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and 18 (18.6%) experienced clinical heart failure within one year of induction. The median difference from baseline to lowest left ventricular ejection fraction was -5.0 percentage points, with a range of +10.0 to -52.5. The median time to onset of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was 27 days, at a median cumulative anthracycline dose of 270 mg/m(2). No patient-specific or medication-specific factors were significantly associated with the risk of developing reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Of 14 patients started on medical management for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, 10 (71%) responded to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, we observed that acute myeloid leukemia patients experienced reduced left ventricular ejection fraction more quickly and at lower doses than previously reported in the solid tumor population. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was at least partially reversible in most patients started on medical management. Although no factors were significantly associated with decreased cardiomyopathy risk, future assessment of cardioprotective medications may be warranted.","['Mort, Meredith K', 'Sen, Jeremy M', 'Morris, Amy L', 'DeGregory, Kathlene A', 'McLoughlin, Erin M', 'Mort, Joseph F', 'Dunn, Steven P', 'Abuannadi, Mohammad', 'Keng, Michael K']","['Mort MK', 'Sen JM', 'Morris AL', 'DeGregory KA', 'McLoughlin EM', 'Mort JF', 'Dunn SP', 'Abuannadi M', 'Keng MK']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2731-1952'],"['Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190909,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'anthracyclines', 'cardiotoxicity']",2019/09/11 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219873014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Apr;26(3):680-687. doi: 10.1177/1078155219873014.

We evaluated ABCB1 activity in relation with clinical parameters and treatment response to standard chemotherapy in 321 patients with de novo AML. We assessed multiple clinical relationships of ABCB1 activity-ex vivo drug resistance, gene expression, and the ABCB1 inhibitor quinine were evaluated. ABCB1 activity was observed in 58% of AML and was linked to low white blood cell count, high expression of CD34, absence of FLT3-ITD, and absence of mutant NPM1. Moreover, ABCB1 activity was associated with worse overall- and event-free survival. However, ABCB1 activity did not directly lead to ex vivo drug resistance to anthracyclines. We found that ABCB1 was highly correlated with gene expressions of BAALC, CD34, CD200, and CD7, indicating that ABCB1 expression maybe a passenger characteristic of high-risk AML. Furthermore, ABCB1 was inversely correlated to HOX cluster genes and CD33. Thus, low ABCB1 AML patients benefited specifically from anti-CD33 treatment by gemtuzumab ozogamicin in addition to standard chemotherapy. We showed prognostic importance of ABCB1 gene expression, protein expression, and activity. Furthermore, ABCB1 was not directly linked to drug resistance, ABCB1 inhibition did not improve outcome of high ABCB1 AML patients and thus high ABCB1 may represent a passenger characteristic of high-risk AML.","['Boyer, Thomas', 'Gonzales, Fanny', 'Barthelemy, Adeline', 'Marceau-Renaut, Alice', 'Peyrouze, Pauline', 'Guihard, Soizic', 'Lepelley, Pascale', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Delattre, Carole', 'Wetterwald, Marc', 'Pottier, Nicolas', 'Plantier, Isabelle', 'Botton, Stephane de', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Cheok, Meyling']","['Boyer T', 'Gonzales F', 'Barthelemy A', 'Marceau-Renaut A', 'Peyrouze P', 'Guihard S', 'Lepelley P', 'Plesa A', 'Nibourel O', 'Delattre C', 'Wetterwald M', 'Pottier N', 'Plantier I', 'Botton S', 'Dombret H', 'Berthon C', 'Preudhomme C', 'Roumier C', 'Cheok M']",,"['Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Univ.

However, the specific biological mechanisms responsible for the association of heavy metals with the unusually high incidence of upper tract urothelial carcinoma in Taiwan are complex and incompletely understood. METHODS: To elucidate the specific biological mechanism and identify molecular indicators of the unusually high association of upper tract urothelial carcinoma with heavy metal exposure, protein expression following the treatment of T24 human bladder carcinoma and RT4 human bladder papilloma cell line models with arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) was studied. Proteomic changes in these cell models were integrated with data from a human bladder cancer (BLCA) tissue proteome to identify possible protein indicators of heavy metal exposure. RESULTS: After mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis and verification by Western blotting procedures, we identified 66 proteins that were up-regulated and 92 proteins that were down-regulated in RT4 cell extracts after treatment with As or Cd. Some 52 proteins were up-regulated and 136 proteins were down-regulated in T24 cell extracts after treatment with Cd. We further confirmed that down-expression of the PML (promyelocytic leukemia) protein was sustained for at least 75 days after exposure of bladder cells to As. Dysregulation of these cellular proteins by As was associated with three biological pathways. Immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin-embedded BLCA tissue slides confirmed that PML protein expression was decreased in BLCA tumor cells compared with adjacent noncancerous epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PML may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BLCA and may be an indicator of heavy metal exposure in bladder cells.","['Chen, Yi-Ting', 'Ou Yang, Wei-Ting', 'Juang, Horng-Heng', 'Chen, Chien-Lun', 'Chen, Hsiao-Wei', 'Tsui, Ke-Hung', 'Chang, Ying-Hsu', 'Tsai, Cheng-Han', 'Hsueh, Chuen', 'Liao, Wei-Chao']","['Chen YT', 'Ou Yang WT', 'Juang HH', 'Chen CL', 'Chen HW', 'Tsui KH', 'Chang YH', 'Tsai CH', 'Hsueh C', 'Liao WC']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0063-4965'],"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nephrology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, TaoYuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, LinKou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Chang Gung University, College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Center for General Education, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['CMRPD3E0031, CMRPD3E0032, CMRPD3E0033, CMRPD3E0251/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,', 'Taiwan', '104-2113-M-182-001-MY2 and 106-2113-M-182-001-MY2/The Ministry of Science and', 'Technology of Taiwan, Republic of China', 'MOST 108-2113-M-182-002/the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,', 'Republic of China', 'CLRPD190017/Chang Gung University', 'MOST 108-2113-M-182-002-/Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, Republic', 'of China', '106-2113-M-182-001-MY2/Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, Republic of', 'China', '104-2113-M-182-001-MY2/Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, Republic of', 'China', 'BMRPD78/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPG3E0163/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPD1G0131/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPD3E0252/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPD3E0251/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPD3E0033/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPD3E0032/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital', 'CMRPD3E0031/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital']",['Journal Article'],20200208,England,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,8802365,,,,2019/09/10 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rcm.8578 [doi]'],ppublish,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2020 Apr;34 Suppl 1:e8578. doi: 10.1002/rcm.8578.

The UKALL 2011 randomised trial investigated whether a more intense dexamethasone dose (10 mg/m(2)/d x 14d, short vs 6 mg/m(2)/d x 28d, standard) would lead to a more rapid cytoreduction and reduced adverse effects associated with longer durations of steroids in induction. The impact of dose and duration on dexamethasone pharmacokinetics was investigated. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained on one of the first three and last three days of induction dexamethasone dosing at time points up to 8 h after oral administration. Plasma dexamethasone levels were quantified in 1084 plasma samples obtained from 174 children and a population pharmacokinetic model developed. RESULTS: Drug exposure varied significantly between patients, with a >12-fold variation in AUC0-12h values and a marked overlap in dexamethasone exposures between dose levels. Intuitively, AUC0-12h was significantly higher with short dosing (10 mg/m(2)/d), but cumulative exposure was significantly higher with standard dosing over 28 days, after a higher cumulative dose. Concomitant rasburicase administration was associated with a 60% higher dexamethasone clearance. Day 8 bone marrow response was comparable between dosing arms, but those with <5% blast count exhibited a greater mean dexamethasone exposure than those with >5%. No statistical differences were observed between arms in terms of steroid-related toxicity or minimal residual disease at the end of induction. CONCLUSION: The potential significance of dexamethasone AUC0-12h on early response and higher cumulative exposure on the standard arm suggest that duration of therapy and exposure may be more important factors than absolute dose from a clinical pharmacology perspective.","['Jackson, Rosanna K', 'Liebich, Martina', 'Berry, Philip', 'Errington, Julie', 'Liu, Jizhong', 'Parker, Catriona', 'Moppett, John', 'Samarasinghe, Sujith', 'Hough, Rachael', 'Rowntree, Clare', 'Goulden, Nick J', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Kearns, Pamela R', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Hempel, Georg', 'Irving, Julie A E', 'Veal, Gareth J']","['Jackson RK', 'Liebich M', 'Berry P', 'Errington J', 'Liu J', 'Parker C', 'Moppett J', 'Samarasinghe S', 'Hough R', 'Rowntree C', 'Goulden NJ', 'Vora A', 'Kearns PR', 'Saha V', 'Hempel G', 'Irving JAE', 'Veal GJ']",,"['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medical Chemistry, Clinical Pharmacy, University of Munster, Germany.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'University College Hospital, London, UK.', 'University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Studies, University of Birmingham, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, UK; Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medical Chemistry, Clinical Pharmacy, University of Munster, Germany.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.

The association between myocardial calcification and tumor lysis syndrome has not been reported to date. A 50-year-old man with hyperthermia and general malaise presented to our hospital and was clinically diagnosed with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and febrile neutropenia accompanied by septic shock. Prednisolone was administered for tumor reduction. Two to three hours later, electrocardiography demonstrated ST elevation in V4-6, and blood tests showed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed diffuse severe hypokinesis with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Additionally, blood tests showed that serum phosphorus level increased to 8.0 mg/dl, which was likely due to tumor lysis syndrome. Circulatory and respiratory failure due to left heart failure progressed, and he died 3 days after administration of prednisolone. Pathological autopsy revealed diffuse proliferation of atypical B-lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, which led to the pathological diagnosis of B-ALL, accompanied by necrosis. On the cut surface of the heart, the left ventricle was dilated, and patchy yellowish-brown areas were present in the epicardial-side of the myocardium and spread through the circumferential wall of the left ventricle and interventricular septum. Microscopically, myocardial fibers were granularly basophilic in that area and were revealed as calcium deposits by Von Kossa staining. He was diagnosed with myocardial calcification. The drastic increase in the serum phosphorus level caused by tumor lysis syndrome seemed to be associated with myocardial calcification.","['Usui, Genki', 'Hashimoto, Hirotsugu', 'Uchibori, Yusuke', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Horiuchi, Hajime', 'Morikawa, Teppei']","['Usui G', 'Hashimoto H', 'Uchibori Y', 'Usuki K', 'Horiuchi H', 'Morikawa T']",,"['Department of Diagnostic Pathology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Faculty of Healthcare, Tokyo Healthcare University, Tokyo, Japan.

Using a strict selection criterion, utilizing MeSH terminology and Boolean logic, an electronic search of MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore Digital Library was performed. The electronic search was complemented by handsearching of references of related studies and the top results of Google Scholar. The full texts of 58 articles were reviewed, out of which, 22 studies were included. The number of studies discussing ALL, AML, CLL, and CML was 12, 8, 3, and 1, respectively. No studies were prospectively applying algorithms in real-world scenarios. Majority of studies had small and homogenous samples and used supervised learning for classification tasks. 91% of the studies were performed after 2010, and 74% of the included studies applied ML algorithms to microscopic diagnosis of leukemia. The included studies illustrated the need to develop the field of ML research, including the transformation from solely designing algorithms to practically applying them clinically.","['Salah, Haneen T', 'Muhsen, Ibrahim N', 'Salama, Mohamed E', 'Owaidah, Tarek', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K']","['Salah HT', 'Muhsen IN', 'Salama ME', 'Owaidah T', 'Hashmi SK']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2676-0473'],"['College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190909,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['diagnosis', 'digital', 'leukemia', 'machine learning', 'pathology']",2019/09/10 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13089 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2019 Dec;41(6):717-725. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13089.

Several approaches have been proposed. The objective of this work is to explore the value of a 10color protocol developed in our laboratory for flow cytometric assessment of PB leukocytic subsets, as part of a 2tube screening panel. A combination of CD16/CD56/CD34/CD33/CD19/CD4/CD8/CD3/CD20/CD45 antibodies in 1 tube was applied routinely during flow cytometric analysis of PB samples for diagnostic purposes. The protocol was systematically complemented by a 2nd tube with anti-kappa, anti-lambda, CD5, CD19, and CD45 antibodies for adults and selected pediatric patients, and specifically oriented panels when necessary. 25 samples with no detectable neoplastic PB involvement and 31 samples with a hematolymphoid disorder were investigated retrospectively. The contribution of CD33 in the separation of leukocytic populations, as well as the benefits from the simultaneous assessment of CD20/CD19/CD45, CD16/CD56 and the detection of CD34+ cells were examined. The gating strategy with the use of CD33 provided additional information in certain cases. The protocol enabled recognition of differential expression of CD20 and CD45 in CD19+ cells with chronic lymphocytic leukemia phenotype, overall evaluation of NK and NK like T cells, estimation of CD16- granulocytes and CD56/CD16 expression in monocytes, as well as identification of minor cell subsets, such as CD34+ cells. The proposed 10color combination of antibodies analyzed in a standardized manner can offer significant information in the initial evaluation of PB samples, thus, guiding subsequent investigation if needed.","['Gounari, Evdoxia', 'Tsavdaridou, Vasiliki', 'Ioakeimidou, Aliki', 'Haidich, Anna-Bettina', 'Skoura, Lemonia']","['Gounari E', 'Tsavdaridou V', 'Ioakeimidou A', 'Haidich AB', 'Skoura L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3010-5677'],"['Department of Immunology, Microbiology Laboratory, AHEPA University Hospital , Thessaloniki , Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Microbiology Laboratory, AHEPA University Hospital , Thessaloniki , Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Microbiology Laboratory, AHEPA University Hospital , Thessaloniki , Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki , Thessaloniki , Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Microbiology Laboratory, AHEPA University Hospital , Thessaloniki , Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20190909,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'blood', 'hematologic neoplasms', 'immunophenotyping', 'lymphocytes', 'lymphoproliferative disorders']",2019/09/10 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00365513.2019.1661007 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2019 Nov;79(7):475-483. doi: 10.1080/00365513.2019.1661007.

In this study, we report a rational data-driven strategy for achieving restricted polypharmacology in the design of antitumor agents selectively targeting the TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK (TAM) family tyrosine kinases. Our computational approach, based on the concept of fragments in structural environments (FRASE), distills relevant chemical information from structural and chemogenomic databases to assemble a three-dimensional inhibitor structure directly in the protein pocket.

However, the biological role and clinical significance of most lncRNA in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. METHODS: We investigate the biological function, mechanism of action and clinical expression of lncRNA MYOSLID in GC. First, we analysed the differential expression of lncRNA MYOSLID in GC tissues and non-cancerous tissues by analysing the sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Subsequently, we verified that lncRNA MYOSLID regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of GC cells by acting as a ceRNA against miR-29c-3p. The nude mouse xenograft was used to further confirm the functional significance of lncRNA MYOSLID in vivo. RESULTS: We found for the first time that the expression of lncRNA MYOSLID was significantly up-regulated in GC tissues, and the up-regulation of lncRNA MYOSLID in GC was correlated with tumour size, AJCC stage, depth of invasion and survival time. In addition, apoptosis and growth arrest can be induced in vitro after knockdown of lncRNA MYOSLID, which inhibits tumorigenesis in mouse xenografts in vivo. Further in-depth studies revealed that lncRNA MYOSLID acts as a ceRNA of miR-29c-3p, resulting in de-repression of its downstream target gene MCL-1. CONCLUSION: The lncRNA MYOSLID-miR-29c-3p-MCL-1 axis plays a key role in the development of GC. Our findings may provide potential new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of human GC.","['Han, Yuying', 'Wu, Nan', 'Jiang, Mingzuo', 'Chu, Yi', 'Wang, Zhiyang', 'Liu, Hao', 'Cao, Jiayi', 'Liu, Hanming', 'Xu, Bing', 'Xie, Xin']","['Han Y', 'Wu N', 'Jiang M', 'Chu Y', 'Wang Z', 'Liu H', 'Cao J', 'Liu H', 'Xu B', 'Xie X']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7132-5609'],"[""Laboratory of Tissue Engineering, Faculty of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."", ""Laboratory of Tissue Engineering, Faculty of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."", ""State key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""State key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Laboratory of Tissue Engineering, Faculty of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."", ""State key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Air Force Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Laboratory of Tissue Engineering, Faculty of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."", 'College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Laboratory of Tissue Engineering, Faculty of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['61471181/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2019M653667/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'China Postdoctoral Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20190909,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,PMC6869334,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastric cancer', 'ceRNA', 'lncRNA MYOSLID', 'miR-29c-3p', 'myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (MCL-1)']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.12678 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2019 Nov;52(6):e12678. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12678.

Exosomes are responsible for trafficking proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) among cells and regulating various cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Although our knowledge of the roles of exosomes in the initiation and progression of leukemia is limited, some studies have indicated that exosomes can encompass many functional factors with an appropriate sorting signal, thereby supporting the metastasis, drug resistance, and immune escape of leukemia cells. This review initially focuses on the biogenesis and composition of exosomes and then summarizes the application of exosomes as a screening biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in leukemia. Many recent reports on the functions of exosomes released from leukemia cells are also discussed, including drug resistance, immune dysfunction, and microenvironment manipulation. Given the critical roles of exosomes in leukemia, understanding the mechanisms regulating the compositions and levels of exosomes, as well as defining exosome functions, will ultimately provide additional insights into the use of exosomes as therapeutic agents for leukemia treatment.","['Yang, Chao', 'Yang, Huan', 'Liu, Jia', 'Zhu, Lidan', 'Yu, Shicang', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Gao, Lei']","['Yang C', 'Yang H', 'Liu J', 'Zhu L', 'Yu S', 'Zhang X', 'Gao L']",,"['Medical Center of Hematology, The Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Medical Center of Hematology, The Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Medical Center of Hematology, The Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Medical Center of Hematology, The Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Pathology of Ministry of Education Chongqing, China.', 'Medical Center of Hematology, The Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Medical Center of Hematology, The Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190801,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,PMC6726990,['NOTNLM'],"['Exosomes', 'leukemia', 'lncRNA', 'microRNA', 'microenvironment']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/10 06:01,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2019 Aug 1;9(8):1815-1829. eCollection 2019.,,1815-1829,,,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The crystal structure of menin indicates that it acts as a scaffold protein to bind the N-terminus of MLL via a central pocket. Small molecule menin-MLL inhibitors (MIs) bind the menin pocket to disrupt the menin/MLL interaction, resulting in suppression of MLL-FP-transformed acute myeoloid leukemia (AML). It is thought that MIs suppress the MLL-FP-induced leukemia by blocking the menin/MLL interaction and menin/MLL-induced HOX gene transcription. However, it is not clear whether MIs also affect other aspects of menin biology beyond disruption of the menin/MLL interaction. Here we show for the first time that MIs reduced menin protein levels and decreased the half-life of menin protein but have no effect on mRNA level in MLL-FP-expressing leukemia cells, and proteasome or E1 ligase inhibitor rescued the MI-induced menin degradation. Notably, the MI-induced reduction of H3K4m3 and HOXA9 expression was rescued with a proteasome inhibitor that blocks MI-induced menin protein degradation. Mechanistically, MIs promote the interaction of menin with Hsp70-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP, resulting in increased menin ubiquitination, leading to increased menin degradation. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism whereby small molecule MIs increase menin degradation by triggering the Hsp70/CHIP-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that ultimately leads to the reduction in HOXA9 gene expression and leukemia suppression.","['Wu, Yuan', 'Doepner, Miriam', 'Hojnacki, Taylor', 'Feng, Zijie', 'Katona, Bryson W', 'He, Xin', 'Ma, Jian', 'Cao, Yan', 'Busino, Luca', 'Zhou, Fuxiang', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Wu Y', 'Doepner M', 'Hojnacki T', 'Feng Z', 'Katona BW', 'He X', 'Ma J', 'Cao Y', 'Busino L', 'Zhou F', 'Hua X']",,"['Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia 19014, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['R25 HD082842/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20190801,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,PMC6726985,['NOTNLM'],"['Menin', 'leukemia', 'menin-MLL inhibitor', 'ubiquitin-proteasome pathway']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/10 06:01,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2019 Aug 1;9(8):1682-1694. eCollection 2019.,,1682-1694,,,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 55 semiconductor workers with cancer or rare diseases who claimed to the KWCWS were compared based on their work characteristics and types of claimed diseases. Leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and aplastic anemia were grouped into lymphohematopoietic (LHP) disorder. Results: Leukemia (n = 14) and breast cancer (n = 10) were the most common complaints, followed by brain cancer (n = 6), aplastic anemia (n = 6), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4). LHP disorders (n = 24) accounted for 43%. Sixty percent (n = 33) of registered workers (n = 55) were found to have been employed before 2000. Seventy-six percent (n = 42) of registered workers and 79% (n = 19) among the registered workers with LHP (n = 24) were found to be diagnosed at a relatively young age, </=40 years. A total of 18 workers among the registered semiconductor workers were finally determined to deserve compensation for occupational disease by either the KWCWS (n = 10) or the administrative court (n = 8). Eleven fabrication workers who were compensated responded as having handled wafers smaller than eight inches in size. Eight among the 18 workers compensated (44 %) were found to have ever worked at etching operations. Conclusion: The distribution of cancer and rare diseases among registered semiconductor workers was closely related to the manufacturing era before 2005, </=8 inches of wafer size handled, exposure to clean rooms of fabrication and chip assembly operations, and etching operations.","['Park, Dong-Uk', 'Choi, Sangjun', 'Lee, Seunghee', 'Koh, Dong-Hee', 'Kim, Hyoung-Ryoul', 'Lee, Kyong-Hui', 'Park, Jihoon']","['Park DU', 'Choi S', 'Lee S', 'Koh DH', 'Kim HR', 'Lee KH', 'Park J']",,"['Department of Environmental Health, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Occupational Health, Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Health, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, International St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine, Catholic University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'United States Army 65th Medical Brigade, Force Health Protection and Preventive Medicine Unit 15281, USA.', 'Institute of Health and Environment, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190427,Korea (South),Saf Health Work,Safety and health at work,101542940,PMC6717884,['NOTNLM'],"['Chip assembly', 'Etching', 'Fabrication', 'Leukemia', 'Semiconductor operation']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/10 06:01,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2018/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.shaw.2019.03.003 [doi]', 'S2093-7911(18)30400-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Saf Health Work. 2019 Sep;10(3):347-354. doi: 10.1016/j.shaw.2019.03.003.

In present work, we explored multiple approaches to enhance the chance of deriving domed pluripotent rbES cells by inhibition of MEK, GSK, and PKC signaling pathways. Domed stated rbES were derived in defined medium supplemented with 15% KOSR, 10(3) IU/mL mouse LIF, 10 ng/mL bFGF and three inhibitors to the MEK (PD0325901, 1 microM), GSK3 (CHIR99021, 3 microM) and PKC (Go6983, 5 microM) (3i). Domed rbES were passaged every 3-4 days till passage 3-4 for the designated experiments. We showed that bFGF and LIF are indispensable for the derivation and maintenance of rbES; whereas the 3i medium containing inhibitors to the MEK (PD0325901), GSK3 (CHIR99021) and PKC (Go6983) were necessary for deriving domed rbES. Domed rbES possessed naive ES markers as Rex1 and ERAS in addition to Oct4, Klf4, Sox 2 and c-myc by RT-PCR. Domed rbES showed positive staining for Rex1, Fgf4, Klf4, Nanog and Oct4 by immunofluorescence chemistry. Further deleting either one factor in 3i medium as CHIR99021, PD0325901, Go6983 or bFGF resulted in disappearing of domed rbES colonies. The optimal concentrations of 3i contained 0.75 microM PD0325901, 2.25 microM CHIR99021, and 4.5 microM Go6983.

Next, experiments in cells showed that lncRNA-DLEU2 knockdown inhibited, whereas lncRNA-DLEU2 overexpression promoted, the clone formation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. A luciferase reporter assay and an RNA immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that lncRNA-DLEU2 acts as a sponge for miR-186-5p in glioma cells. Further, studies suggested that miR-186-5p inhibits the expression of PDK3, which is an oncogene in glioma. Moreover, with rescue experiments, we demonstrated that lncRNA-DLEU2 regulates the expression of PDK3 and the progression of glioma in a miR-186-5p-dependent manner. Finally, we also showed that lncRNA-DLEU2 promotes glioma growth in a manner that is related to miR-186-5p and PDK3 in vivo. In conclusion, our study reported for the first time that lncRNA-DLEU2 promotes glioma progression by targeting the miR-186-5p/PDK3 axis. These findings provide novel strategies for the gene therapy treatment of glioma.","['Xie, Zuochang', 'Li, Xiaojian', 'Chen, Hua', 'Zeng, Ailiang', 'Shi, Yan', 'Tang, Yong']","['Xie Z', 'Li X', 'Chen H', 'Zeng A', 'Shi Y', 'Tang Y']",,"[""Department of Neurosurgery, The First People's Hospital of Tianmen City Tianmen 431700, Hubei, China."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School Boston 02115, MA, USA."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190815,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,PMC6731438,['NOTNLM'],"['Deleted in lymphocytic leukaemia 2', 'PDK3', 'glioma', 'miR-186-5p']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/10 06:01,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2019 Aug 15;11(8):4922-4934. eCollection 2019.,,4922-4934,,,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to establish whether EBV worsens the course of CLL by up-regulating the programmed cell death 1 expression. Patients and methods: Using polymerase chain reaction, we measured EBV DNA in the blood of 110 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with CLL. We used flow cytometry to measure the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1) on CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells. Additionally, PD-1 and PD-L1 serum concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We related the expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 to EBV DNA load and clinical outcomes. Results: Fifty-nine (54%) patients had detectable EBV DNA [EBV(+)], and these patients had more advanced disease at baseline than the rest. PD-1 and PD-L1 serum concentrations and their expressions on all cell populations were higher in EBV(+) than EBV(-) patients. EBV load correlated positively with unfavourable clinical markers of CLL and the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells (rho =0.42-0.75; p<0.001). EBV(+) patients had increased risks of treatment initiation and lymphocyte doubling during a median follow-up period of 32 months (p<0.001). Among EBV(+), but not EBV(-), patients, higher expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells were associated with higher risks of treatment initiation and lymphocyte doubling (p</=0.020). Conclusion: EBV-induced up-regulation of PD-1-PD-L1 expression is associated with worse outcomes in CLL.","['Grywalska, Ewelina', 'Pasiarski, Marcin', 'Sosnowska-Pasiarska, Barbara', 'Macek, Pawel', 'Rolinska, Agnieszka', 'Samardakiewicz, Marzena', 'Ludian, Jaroslaw', 'Gozdz, Stanislaw', 'Rolinski, Jacek']","['Grywalska E', 'Pasiarski M', 'Sosnowska-Pasiarska B', 'Macek P', 'Rolinska A', 'Samardakiewicz M', 'Ludian J', 'Gozdz S', 'Rolinski J']",,"['Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Oncocardiology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Psychology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Psychology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190812,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC6700397,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1 ligand']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/10 06:01,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S212069 [doi]', '212069 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Aug 12;11:7605-7618. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S212069. eCollection 2019.,,7605-7618,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Despite enormous progress in its diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate of AML remains high. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic biomarkers by using the gene expression profile dataset from public database, and to improve the risk-stratification criteria of survival for patients with AML. Materials and methods: The gene expression data and clinical parameter were acquired from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET) database. A total of 856 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from the childhood AML patients classified into first complete remission (CR1) group (n=791) and not CR group (n=249). We performed a series of bioinformatics analysis to screen key genes and pathways, further comprehending these DEGs through Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Results: Six genes (SLC17A7, MSX2, CDC26, MSLN, CTSZ and DEFA3) identified by univariate, Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to develop the prognostic model. Further analysis showed that the survival estimations in the high-risk group had an increased risk of death compared with the low-risk group based on the model. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve in the prognostic model for predicting the overall survival was 0.729, confirming good prognostic model. We also performed a nomogram to provide an individual patient with the overall probability, and internal validation in the TARGET cohort. Conclusion: We identified a six-gene prognostic signature for risk-stratifying in patients with childhood AML. The risk classification model can be used to predict CR markers and may assist clinicians in providing realize the individualized treatment in this patient population.","['Zhang, Nan', 'Chen, Ying', 'Lou, Shifeng', 'Shen, Yan', 'Deng, Jianchuan']","['Zhang N', 'Chen Y', 'Lou S', 'Shen Y', 'Deng J']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190816,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6701647,['NOTNLM'],"['bioinformatics', 'childhood acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene expression profiling', 'prognosis', 'remission induction', 'survival analysis']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/10 06:01,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S218928 [doi]', '218928 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Aug 16;12:6591-6604. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S218928. eCollection 2019.,,6591-6604,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The tumorigenicity of the provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM-1) gene has been studied for many years. However, its significance in breast cancer remains unclear. In this review we briefly summarized the physiological characteristics and regulation of PIM-1 kinase, and subsequently focused on the role of PIM-1 in tumors, especially breast cancer. Oncogene PIM-1 was found to be upregulated in breast cancer, especially in triple-negative breast cancer. Moreover, it is involved in tumorigenesis and the development of drug resistance, and linked to poor prognosis.

Differentiation therapy is effective in treatment of neuroblastomas and myeloid leukemias. Checkpoint inhibition therapy removes blocks to cancer reactive T-killer cells and allows them to react to malignant cells and limit the growth of cancer. The percentage of patients with a given cancer that responds to either therapy is less than hoped for, and the duration of response is variable. Multiplying the response rate (percentage of patients responding to therapy) by the duration of response may be used to derive a survival score for patients treated with differentiation therapy or checkpoint inhibition. By this criterion, differentiation therapy gives better survival scores than checkpoint inhibition. Yet, checkpoint inhibition is considered a great success, mostly because it may be applied to many different types of cancer, and differentiation therapy is considered relatively ineffective because it is limited to a few specific cancers. On the other hand, the cost of checkpoint inhibition treatment is 10-20 times more per patient than that of differentiation therapy. Hopefully, future combined treatments and advances in both approaches will increase the effectiveness of these cancer treatments.","['Sell, Stewart', 'Ilic, Zoran']","['Sell S', 'Ilic Z']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3703-789X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1952-2119']","['Division of Translational Medicine, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY, USA.', 'Albany College of Pharmacy and University at Albany, Albany, NY, USA.', 'Division of Translational Medicine, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer stem cells', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'differentiation therapy', 'myeloid leukemia', 'survival scores']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428319873749 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2019 Sep;41(9):1010428319873749. doi: 10.1177/1010428319873749.,20190925,1010428319873749,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of STAG2 in gene regulation, hematopoiesis, and tumor suppression remains unresolved. We show that Stag2 deletion in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in altered hematopoietic function, increased self-renewal, and impaired differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing revealed that, although Stag2 and Stag1 bind a shared set of genomic loci, a component of Stag2 binding sites is unoccupied by Stag1, even in Stag2-deficient HSPCs. Although concurrent loss of Stag2 and Stag1 abrogated hematopoiesis, Stag2 loss alone decreased chromatin accessibility and transcription of lineage-specification genes, including Ebf1 and Pax5, leading to increased self-renewal and reduced HSPC commitment to the B cell lineage. Our data illustrate a role for Stag2 in transformation and transcriptional dysregulation distinct from its shared role with Stag1 in chromosomal segregation.","['Viny, Aaron D', 'Bowman, Robert L', 'Liu, Yu', 'Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Eisman, Shira E', 'Xiao, Wenbin', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Navitski, Anastasia', 'Park, Jane', 'Braunstein, Stephanie', 'Alija, Besmira', 'Karzai, Abdul', 'Csete, Isabelle S', 'Witkin, Matthew', 'Azizi, Elham', 'Baslan, Timour', 'Ott, Christopher J', ""Pe'er, Dana"", 'Dekker, Job', 'Koche, Richard', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Viny AD', 'Bowman RL', 'Liu Y', 'Lavallee VP', 'Eisman SE', 'Xiao W', 'Durham BH', 'Navitski A', 'Park J', 'Braunstein S', 'Alija B', 'Karzai A', 'Csete IS', 'Witkin M', 'Azizi E', 'Baslan T', 'Ott CJ', ""Pe'er D"", 'Dekker J', 'Koche R', 'Levine RL']",,"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Program in Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Center for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Center for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Program in Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 4000 Jones Bridge Road, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Methods: Eighteen patients with hematological malignancies over 50 years were enrolled, including 8 male and 10 female patients. The median age of all patients was 52 (range: 50-66) years. Of them, 8 patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , 2 chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) , 5 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) , 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) , and 1 aggressive natural killer cell leukemia (ANKL) . All patients received fludarabine, cytarabine and melphalan with rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin (FAB+rATG regimen) and transplanted with high dose non-T cell-depleted peripheral hematopoietic stem cells from donors. Enhanced graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and infection prevention were administered. Results: Fifteen days after transplantation, 16 patients achieved complete donor chimerism. One of them rejected the donor graft completely at thirty days after transplantation, and the other 2 patients had mixed chimerism 15 days after transplantation and converted to complete recipient chimerism at 30 days after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) was 61.1% (95%CI49.6%-72.6%) . The incidence of grade - aGVHD was 35.4% (95%CI 21.1%-49.7%) , whereas grade III-IV was 13.8% (95%CI 4.7%-22.9%) . The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) rate was estimated at 38.2% (95%CI 25.5%-50.9%) . Patients were followed-up for a median of 14.5 months (range, 3-44 months) . The Kaplan Meier estimates of 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 72.6% (95%CI 60.1%-85.1%) and 63.7% (95%CI 49.2%-78.2%) , respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse-mortality (NRM) was 31.2% (95%CI 16.5%-45.9%) and 12.5% (95%CI 4.2%-20.8%) , respectively. Conclusion: RIC-haplo-PBSCT protocol can achieve better results in patients with hematologic malignancies over 50 years old.","['Liu, Y', 'Yuan, H L', 'Duan, X L', 'Xu, J L', 'Qu, J H', 'Chen, G', 'Shi, J', 'Han, C X', 'Ding, L L', 'Jiang, M']","['Liu Y', 'Yuan HL', 'Duan XL', 'Xu JL', 'Qu JH', 'Chen G', 'Shi J', 'Han CX', 'Ding LL', 'Jiang M']",,"['Hematologic Disease Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, China; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Research Institute of Hematology, Urumqi 830061, China.']",['chi'],['81660032/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7342871,['NOTNLM'],"['Haploidentical peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Hematologic malignancy', 'Transplantation conditioning']",2019/09/10 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.08.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug 14;40(8):667-672. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.08.008.,20190910,667-672,,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",,,,,,,,,,,,

All the cases were treated with the modified LMB89 Group C regimen. Results: The median age of the patients was 6 (1-14) years. The sex ratio was 5.1ratio1, 144 boys (83.7%) and 28 girls (16.3%) . According to St. Jude staging classification, 2 patients (1.2%) were in stage , 54 (31.4%) in stage and 116 (67.4%) in stage . Of them, 46 patients (26.7%) had mature B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) , and 52 patients had central nervous system (CNS) involvement. According to risk group, the patients can be divided into group C1 (CNS1, without testicles/ovaries involvement, n=65) , group C2 (CNS2, testicles/ovaries involvement, n=55) and group C3 (CNS3, n=52) . A total of 145 patients received rituximab combined with chemotherapy during the treatment, 10 patients suffered from progressive disease and died, and 5 patients relapsed. Treatment-related mortality was 2.9%. With a median follow-up of 36.0 (0.5-119.0) months, 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was (88.9+/-2.4) % and event free survival (EFS) rate was (87.9+/-2.6) % for all patients. 3-year EFS rates were (96.9+/-2.1) %, (90.9+/-3.9) % and (73.4+/-6.5) % for Group C1, C2 and C3 respectively, and that of Group C3 was significantly lower than that of Group C1 (chi(2)=12.939, P=0.001) and Group C2 (chi(2)=6.302, P=0.036) . The 3-year EFS rates were (79.3+/-6.8) % and (44.4+/-16.6) % for patients in group C3 treated with chemotherapy combined with rituximab and chemotherapy alone (chi(2)=5.972, P=0.015) . Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that Stage (including B-ALL) , residual diseases in mid-term evaluation were independent unfavorable prognostic factors[HR=4.241 (95%CI 1.163-27.332) , P=0.026; HR=32.184 (95%CI 11.441-99.996) , P<0.001].

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) was administered during induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received TKI as maintenance therapy. Results: Of them, 91.1% (144/158) patients achieved complete remission (CR) after 1-2 courses of induction. CR rate was 90.5% (57/63) for patients in Hyper-CVAD/MA group and 91.6% (87/95) for patients in CHALL-01 group. There was no difference in CR rates between the two groups (chi(2)=0.057, P=0.811) . The last follow-up was June 2018. A cohort of 134 CR patients could be used for further analysis, among them, 53 patients received Hyper-CVAD/MA regimen and other 81 patients received CHALL-01 regimen.

Upon cessation of CLL therapy, including ibrutinib, autoimmune flares can occur. In a 68-year-old man with CLL, ibrutinib was held for 2 weeks prior to elective shoulder surgery. Eleven days after stopping therapy, he presented with a purpuric rash on his right hip, buttock, and lower extremities. He experienced two episodes of seizure activity while hospitalized. MRI brain demonstrated patchy areas of altered signal involving deep white matter and sub-cortical white matter structures concerning for cerebral vasculitis. Although there was no evidence of hemolysis, serum cold agglutinin titer was elevated at > 1:512 and cryoglobulin levels were positive at 36%. He was diagnosed with type I cryoglobulinemia and treated with rituximab, plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone, and ibrutinib was restarted. This regimen resolved his symptoms. A rare complication of CLL is the production of cryoglobulins, which can present at initial diagnosis or in relapsed disease. Our case demonstrates that the cessation of ibrutinib therapy, even for a short time, can precipitate complications. To our knowledge, we report the first case of a patient with well-controlled CLL who rapidly developed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis after stopping ibrutinib therapy.","['Wright, Nicholas', 'Voshtina, Ensi', 'George, Gemlyn', 'Singavi, Arun', 'Field, Joshua']","['Wright N', 'Voshtina E', 'George G', 'Singavi A', 'Field J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1177-8208'],"['Hematology/Oncology Department, Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, 9200 West Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI, 53226, USA. nlwright@mcw.edu.', ', 2139A N 72nd St, Wauwatosa, WI, 53213, USA. nlwright@mcw.edu.', 'Hematology/Oncology Department, Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, 9200 West Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI, 53226, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology Department, Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, 9200 West Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI, 53226, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology Department, Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, 9200 West Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI, 53226, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology Department, Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, 9200 West Wisconsin Ave, Milwaukee, WI, 53226, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190907,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Cold agglutinin', 'Cryoglobulinemia', 'Ibrutinib']",2019/09/09 06:00,2020/04/16 06:00,['2019/09/09 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02729-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02729-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Dec;110(6):751-755. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02729-4.

With the recent availability of advanced high-throughput technologies, Boolean models have increasingly grown in size and complexity, posing a challenge for existing software simulation tools that have not scaled at the same speed. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are powerful reconfigurable integrated circuits that can offer massive performance improvements. Due to their highly parallel nature, FPGAs are well suited to simulate complex molecular networks. We present here a new simulation framework for Boolean models, which first converts the model to Verilog, a standardized hardware description language, and then connects it to an execution core that runs on an FPGA coherently attached to a POWER8 processor. We report an order of magnitude speedup over a multi-threaded software simulation tool running on the same processor on a selection of Boolean models. Analysis on a T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) demonstrates that our framework achieves consistent performance improvements resulting in new biological insights. In addition, we show that our solution allows to perform attractor detection at an unprecedented speed, exhibiting a speedup ranging from one to three orders of magnitude compared to alternative software solutions.","['Manica, Matteo', 'Polig, Raphael', 'Purandare, Mitra', 'Mathis, Roland', 'Hagleitner, Christoph', 'Martinez, Maria Rodriguez']","['Manica M', 'Polig R', 'Purandare M', 'Mathis R', 'Hagleitner C', 'Martinez MR']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201208,United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,,,,2019/09/09 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2019/09/09 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2019.2936836 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2020 Nov-Dec;17(6):2141-2147. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2019.2936836.

Its management by detorsion results in ovarian ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Thus, a conservative treatment with detorsion is highly recommended. Therefore, we attempted to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-(1-7)) treatment against ovarian IR injury. MAIN METHODS: Female rats were included into: Sham group; Ang-(1-7) (300mug/kg, i.p.) group; ovarian IR groups with and without Ang-(1-7) treatment. We determined ovarian Ang-(1-7), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) in addition to serum total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) levels. Ovarian gene expressions of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Mas receptor, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) were estimated. Furthermore, histopathological changes and ovarian expressions of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthases (iNOS and eNOS) were done. KEY FINDINGS: Treatment of ovarian IR rats with Ang-(1-7) led to marked improvement of ovarian damage through histological examination which was accompanied with marked increase in ovarian Ang-(1-7) level and expressions of ACE2 and Mas receptor, decrease in MDA and NO levels and expressions of NF-kB, iNOS and TNF-alpha with increase in serum TAC levels and ovarian expressions of eNOS and BCL-2. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results proved the protective effect of Ang-(1-7) against ovarian IR injury in rats and this may be attributed to ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis which showed anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Therefore, Ang-(1-7) can be used in the future for treatment of ovarian IR injury.","['Ali, Fatma F', 'Ahmed, Amira F', 'Elroby Ali, Doaa M']","['Ali FF', 'Ahmed AF', 'Elroby Ali DM']",,"['Medical Physiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.

CML is treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which target BCR-ABL, to eradicate BCR-ABL + cells. However, the TKI imatinib (IM) fails to eliminate quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in CML. In this study, we demonstrate that transcription factor TAL1 is down-regulated in CML LSCs by BCR-ABL, and IM triggers TAL1 mRNA expression. In addition, loss of TAL1 abrogates IM-induced CML cell apoptosis. RNA-seq analysis suggests that TAL1 expression may affect PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, depletion of TAL1 inhibits the expression of PTEN, which is a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our results reveal an unexpected involvement of TAL1 in CML etiology and demonstrate that TAL1 may regulate PTEN expression and lead to inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the response of CML cells to TKI. These results implicate regulation of PTEN expression as a novel mechanism for the transcriptional regulatory networks of TAL1 in CML.","['Wu, Yifan', 'Hu, Yanyun', 'Yu, Xibao', 'Zhang, Yikai', 'Huang, Xin', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'Zeng, Chengwu']","['Wu Y', 'Hu Y', 'Yu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang X', 'Chen S', 'Li Y', 'Zeng C']",,"['Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Department of Experimental Research, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Guangzhou, 510080, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.

Here we show that during induction of DNA damage-induced senescence in human non-cancerous cells, PML accumulates at the nucleolar periphery simultaneously with inactivation of RNA polymerase I (RNAP I) and nucleolar segregation. Using time-lapse and high-resolution microscopy, we followed the genesis, structural transitions and destiny of PNAs to show that: 1) the dynamic structural changes of the PML-nucleolar interaction are tightly associated with inactivation and reactivation of RNAP I-mediated transcription, respectively; 2) the PML-nucleolar compartment develops sequentially under stress and, upon stress termination, it culminates in either of two fates: disappearance or persistence; 3) all PNAs stages can associate with DNA damage markers; 4) the persistent, commonly long-lasting PML multi-protein nucleolar structures (PML-NDS) associate with markers of DNA damage, indicating a role of PNAs in persistent DNA damage response characteristic for senescent cells. Given the emerging evidence implicating PML in homologous recombination-directed DNA repair, we propose that PNAs contribute to sequestration and faithful repair of the highly unstable ribosomal DNA repeats, a fundamental process to maintain a precise balance between DNA repair mechanisms, with implications for genomic integrity and aging.","['Imrichova, Terezie', 'Hubackova, Sona', 'Kucerova, Alena', 'Kosla, Jan', 'Bartek, Jiri', 'Hodny, Zdenek', 'Vasicova, Pavla']","['Imrichova T', 'Hubackova S', 'Kucerova A', 'Kosla J', 'Bartek J', 'Hodny Z', 'Vasicova P']",,"['Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Present address: Institute of Biotechnology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague-West, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Genome Integrity Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Genome Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190907,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC6756913,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage', '*nucleolar segregation', '*rDNA loci', '*super-resolution microscopy', '*time-lapse imaging']",2019/09/08 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.18632/aging.102248 [doi]', '102248 [pii]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2019 Sep 7;11(17):7206-7235. doi: 10.18632/aging.102248.

Here we review the experience with high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide (HD-Et/Cy) in relapsed/refractory acute leukaemias at the Royal Marsden Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients (15 adults, 8 children) with refractory/relapsed acute myeloblastic (n = 18; 78%), lymphoblastic (n = 4; 17%) or biphenotypic (n = 1; 4%) leukaemia who had failed to respond to at least one previous line of chemotherapy received HD-Et/Cy at our institution between 2006 and 2015. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 21.7% (95%CI 4.0-40.0). Median overall survival was 14.8 months (95%CI 9.1-49.1). Eight (35%) patients (7 AML, 1 biphenotypic leukaemia) proceeded to allogeneic transplant after one cycle of HD-Et/Cy: four of them (50%; 3 adults, 1 child) in complete remission and another four children (50%) with aplastic bone marrow with scattered blasts. Among the transplant recipients, three with AML (38%), ie. one adult (responder) and two children with aplastic bone marrow with scattered blasts, became long-term survivors 9.8, 4.4 and 2.5 years post-HD-Et/Cy, respectively. Toxicity profile was comparable to similar regimens with no treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3-4 toxicity was febrile neutropenia (96%). CONCLUSIONS: HD-Et/Cy can salvage patients with refractory/relapsed AML who remain candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation after failure of standard salvage regimens and do not have access to clinical trials.","['Carceller, Fernando', 'Hirsch, Steffen G', 'Khabra, Komel', 'Petterson, Toni', 'Malik, Rubina', 'Guerra-Garcia, Pilar', 'Moreno, Lucas', 'Marshall, Lynley V', 'Taj, Mary', 'Atra, Ayad', 'Ethell, Mark', 'Potter, Mike', 'Lancaster, Donna']","['Carceller F', 'Hirsch SG', 'Khabra K', 'Petterson T', 'Malik R', 'Guerra-Garcia P', 'Moreno L', 'Marshall LV', 'Taj M', 'Atra A', 'Ethell M', 'Potter M', 'Lancaster D']",,"['Paediatric Haemato-Oncology Department, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Downs Road, Sutton, London, SM2 5PT, United Kingdom; Division of Clinical Studies, The Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton, London, SM2 5NG, United Kingdom.

However, optimal methods to determine fitness for alloHCT have yet to be defined. We evaluated the ability of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) to predict post-alloHCT outcomes in a single-center prospective cohort study of patients age 50 years and older. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). A total of 148 patients were included, with a median age of 62 years (range, 50 to 76 years). In multivariate regression analysis, several CGA measures of functional status were predictive of post-alloHCT outcomes, after adjusting for traditional prognostic factors. Any deficit in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 3.08; P = .03) and PFS (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.99; P = .01). A Medical Outcomes Study Physical Health scale (MOS-PH) score <85 was associated with inferior OS (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.40; P = .02), PFS (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.88; P = .03), and increased NRM (subdistribution HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.92; P = .03).

Although there are now four TKIs approved for use in the front-line setting, acquired TKI resistance via secondary kinase domain mutations remains a problem for patients. K0706 is a novel BCR-ABL1 TKI currently under clinical investigation with structural elements similar to those of ponatinib and dasatinib. In this article, we functionally characterize the anti-leukemic activity of K0706 using cell proliferation assays in conjunction with drug resistance screening. We provide details from molecular modeling to support our in vitro findings and additionally describe our limited clinical experience with this drug in two patients treated on trial. We demonstrate that although K0706 retains efficacy against a large spectrum of clinically relevant mutations, it does not appear to have activity against BCR-ABL1(T315I). Early trial experience suggests excellent tolerability, which may positively affect the place of K0706 within the ever-expanding chronic myeloid leukemia treatment paradigm.","['Antelope, Orlando', 'Vellore, Nadeem A', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Patel, Ami B', 'Van Scoyk, Alexandria', 'Clair, Phillip M', 'Deininger, Michael W', ""O'Hare, Thomas""]","['Antelope O', 'Vellore NA', 'Pomicter AD', 'Patel AB', 'Van Scoyk A', 'Clair PM', 'Deininger MW', ""O'Hare T""]",,"['Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Molecular Biology Graduate Program, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.

Many molecular targeting drugs have since been used in the clinic, which is timely as clinical outcomes using conventional chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) reached a plateau. The first memorable success in this field was imatinib, a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which has been applied in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) since 2001. Imatinib drastically changed CML treatment and many CML patients no longer require HSCT. Recently, the second generation TKIs, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, have also been available for CML patients. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is sub-categorized based on cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnormalities. Chemotherapy and HSCT combined with TKI improved the event-free survival rate from 20% to 80% in Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive ALL. Reportedly, another Ph-like ALL subgroup with poor prognosis can also be treated by TKIs; additionally, cell therapies that include bispecific T-cell engagers or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy are emerging. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous disease and FMS-like related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication, is the most robust marker for poor prognosis. Several first-generation TKIs have been studied for clinical use. Notably, chemotherapy plus midostaurin improved survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Therefore, midostaurin was approved to treat adult AML patients with FLT3-ITD in 2017. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a selective anti-CD33 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate, is approved for clinical practice. Many molecular targeting agents are now being used for hematological malignancies.","['Shimada, Akira']",['Shimada A'],,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.

The chromene family exhibits strong anti-cancer effects. Therefore, the effects of six members of the dihydropyrano [2,3-g] chromene family on cell toxicity and apoptosis induction in K562 cancer cells were investigated and compared with those of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The K562 cells were cultured in the presence of the aforementioned chromene derivatives at concentrations of 40 to 200 muM for 24 to 72 h. The effects of these compounds on the growth and viability of the K562 cell line and PBMCs were studied through MTT assay. Furthermore, apoptosis induction was investigated using flow cytometry. Real-time PCR was used for relative quantification of BCL2, Bax, TP53 and BCR- ABL genes after 48 h of exposing K562 cells and PBMCs to 4-Clpgc. Based on the results, these chromene derivatives inhibited the growth of K562 cells. According to the obtained data, 4-Clpgc was the strongest compound with IC50 values of 102 +/- 1.6 muM and 143 +/- 9.41 muM in K562 cells and PBMCs, while pgc was the weakest one with IC50 levels of 278 +/- 2.7 muM and 366 +/- 47 muM in K562 cells and PBMCs (after 72 h), respectively. The results demonstrated that the apoptotic cell percentage in the control group increased from 6.09% to 84.10% and 17.2% to 20.06% in K562 cells and PBMCs after 48 h of treatment, respectively. Moreover, 4-Clpgc treatment increased the expression of Bax and TP53 genes by 42.74 and 35.88 folds in K562 cells and 9.60 and 7.75 folds in PBMCs, respectively. On the other hand, the expression of BCL2 was reduced by 1.47 and 1.38 folds in K562 cells and PBMCs, respectively. These compounds were associated with less toxic effects on normal cells, compared to the cancer cells. In conclusion, these derivatives can be considered as appropriate candidates for leukemia treatment.","['Asgari, Fatemeh', 'Mahinpour, Roya', 'Moradi, Leila', 'Haghighipour, Nooshin']","['Asgari F', 'Mahinpour R', 'Moradi L', 'Haghighipour N']",,"['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Kashan, P.O.Box 8731753153, Kashan, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Kashan, P.O.Box 8731753153, Kashan, Iran. mahinpur@kashanu.ac.ir.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Kashan, P.O.Box 8731753153, Kashan, Iran.', 'National Cell Bank of Iran, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran. haghighipour@pasteur.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190906,Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,PMC7176807,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BCL2', 'BCR-ABL', 'Bax', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dihydropyrano [2,3-g] chromene']",2019/09/08 06:00,2019/09/08 06:01,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/08 06:01 [medline]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12079-019-00530-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12079-019-00530-w [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2020 Mar;14(1):77-91. doi: 10.1007/s12079-019-00530-w.

It results in a fusion gene encoding a chimeric transcription factor, MLL-AF4, that deregulates gene expression through a variety of still controversial mechanisms. To provide new insights into these mechanisms, we examined the interaction between AF4, the most common MLL fusion partner, and the scaffold protein 14-3-3theta, in the context of t(4;11)-positive leukemia. METHODS: Protein-protein interactions were analyzed using immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays, and by fluorescence microscopy in t(4;11)-positive RS4;11 and MV4-11 leukemia cells and in HEK293 cells. Protein and mRNA expression levels were determined by Western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively. A 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assay and an annexin V/propidium iodide assay were used to assess proliferation and apoptosis rates, respectively, in t(4;11)-positive and control cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to assess binding of 14-3-3theta and AF4 to a specific promoter element. RESULTS: We found that AF4 and 14-3-3theta are nuclear interactors, that 14-3-3theta binds Ser(588) of AF4 and that 14-3-3theta forms a complex with MLL-AF4. In addition, we found that in t(4;11)-positive cells, 14-3-3theta knockdown decreased the expression of MLL-AF4 target genes, induced apoptosis and hampered cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3theta knockdown impaired the recruitment of AF4, but not of MLL-AF4, to target chromatin. Overall, our data indicate that the activity of the chimeric transcription factor MLL-AF4 depends on the cellular availability of 14-3-3theta, which triggers the transactivating function and subsequent degradation of AF4. CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that the scaffold protein 14-3-3theta enhances the aberrant activity of the chimeric transcription factor MLL-AF4 and, therefore, represents a new player in the molecular pathogenesis of t(4;11)-positive leukemia and a new promising therapeutic target.","['Fioretti, Tiziana', 'Cevenini, Armando', 'Zanobio, Mariateresa', 'Raia, Maddalena', 'Sarnataro, Daniela', 'Salvatore, Francesco', 'Esposito, Gabriella']","['Fioretti T', 'Cevenini A', 'Zanobio M', 'Raia M', 'Sarnataro D', 'Salvatore F', 'Esposito G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2346-3564'],"['IRCCS SDN, 80143, Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Molecolare e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Via S.

A total of 257 adults with Ph-negative BCP-ALL who were consecutively diagnosed and received at least 1 course of induction therapy at our institute were retrospectively analyzed. The WT1 expression patterns were significantly different among the molecularly and cytogenetically defined groups (E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, and MLL rearrangements; high hyperdiploidy and B-other). By considering the WT1 expression pattern and the relapse status, 2 cutoff values, 1.8% and 7.2%, were arbitrarily selected to place patients into WT1-low, WT1-inter, and WT1-high groups. In the B-other patients who achieved complete remission (CR), WT1-low and WT1-high patients had similar 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates, which were all significantly lower than those of WT1-inter patients.

In vivo studies have shown that depletion of marrow MSCs resulted in reduction of hematopoietic stem cell content, and there is in vitro evidence that marrow MSCs are able to support leukemia progenitor cell proliferation and survival and provide resistance to cytotoxic therapies. How MSCs from leukemia marrow differ from normal counterparts and how they are influenced by the presence of leukemia stem and progenitor cells are still incompletely understood. In this work, we compared normal donor (ND) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) derived MSCs and found that AML-MSCs had increased adipogenic potential with improved ability to support survival of leukemia progenitor cells. To identify underlying changes, RNA-Seq analysis was performed. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed adipogenesis to be among the set of altered biological pathways dysregulated in AML-MSCs as compared with ND-MSCs. Expression of both SOX9 and EGR2 was decreased in AML-MSCs as compared with ND-MSCs. Increasing expression of SOX9 decreased adipogenic potential of AML-MSCs and decreased their ability to support AML progenitor cells. These findings suggest that AML-MSCs possess adipogenic potential which may enhance support of leukemia progenitor cells.","['Azadniv, Mitra', 'Myers, Jason R', 'McMurray, Helene R', 'Guo, Naxin', 'Rock, Phil', 'Coppage, Myra L', 'Ashton, John', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Calvi, Laura M', 'Liesveld, Jane L']","['Azadniv M', 'Myers JR', 'McMurray HR', 'Guo N', 'Rock P', 'Coppage ML', 'Ashton J', 'Becker MW', 'Calvi LM', 'Liesveld JL']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6969-239X'],"['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'The James P Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'The James P Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Genomics Research Center, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'The James P Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'The James P Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Genomics Research Center, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'The James P Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'The James P Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.

Targeting LSCs is a promising approach for preventing AML relapse and improving long-term outcomes. While Slug, a zinc-finger transcription repressor, negatively regulates the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells, its functions in AML are still unknown. We report here that Slug promotes leukemogenesis and its loss impairs LSC self-renewal and delays leukemia progression. Mechanistically, Slc13a3, a direct target of Slug in LSCs, restricts the self-renewal of LSCs and markedly prolongs recipient survival. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SLUG or forced expression of Slc13a3 suppresses the growth of human AML cells. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that Slug differentially regulates self-renewal of LSCs and normal HSCs, and both Slug and Slc13a3 are potential therapeutic targets of LSCs.","['Zhang, Zhonghui', 'Li, Lei', 'Wu, Chen', 'Yin, Guoshu', 'Zhu, Pei', 'Zhou, Yalu', 'Hong, Yuanfan', 'Ni, Hongyu', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Wu, Wen-Shu']","['Zhang Z', 'Li L', 'Wu C', 'Yin G', 'Zhu P', 'Zhou Y', 'Hong Y', 'Ni H', 'Qian Z', 'Wu WS']",,"['School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, 200444, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and University of Illinois Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, 200444, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and University of Illinois Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, 515041, Guangdong, China.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and University of Illinois Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and University of Illinois Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and University of Illinois Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and The University of Florida, Cancer/Genetics Research Complex, Florida, FL, 32610, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and University of Illinois Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA. wenshuwu@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 AG040182/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK090478/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK107615/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL131444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190906,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6995768,,,2019/09/08 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2018/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0566-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0566-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Feb;34(2):380-390. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0566-x.

Here we show that caspase-11, the cytosolic receptor for bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS), enhances GVHD severity. Allo-HSCT markedly increases the LPS-caspase-11 interaction, leading to the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Caspase-11 and GSDMD mediate the release of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) in allo-HSCT. Deletion of Caspase-11 or Gsdmd, inhibition of LPS-caspase-11 interaction, or neutralizing IL-1alpha uniformly reduces intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, donor T cell expansion and mortality in allo-HSCT. Importantly, Caspase-11 deficiency does not decrease the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, which is essential to prevent cancer relapse. These findings have major implications for allo-HSCT, as pharmacological interference with the caspase-11 signaling might reduce GVHD while preserving GVL activity.","['Lu, Yanyan', 'Meng, Ran', 'Wang, Xiangyu', 'Xu, Yajing', 'Tang, Yiting', 'Wu, Jianfeng', 'Xue, Qianqian', 'Yu, Songlin', 'Duan, Mingwu', 'Shan, Dongyong', 'Wang, Qingde', 'Wang, Haichao', 'Billiar, Timothy R', 'Xiao, Xianzhong', 'Chen, Fangping', 'Lu, Ben']","['Lu Y', 'Meng R', 'Wang X', 'Xu Y', 'Tang Y', 'Wu J', 'Xue Q', 'Yu S', 'Duan M', 'Shan D', 'Wang Q', 'Wang H', 'Billiar TR', 'Xiao X', 'Chen F', 'Lu B']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0211-9000', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8597-0406']","['Department of Hematology and Critical Care Medicine, The 3rd Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410000, P.R.

Analysis of sequence data from 419 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases demonstrated a significant association between SUZ12 and JAK3 mutations. Here we show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of Suz12 cooperates with mutant JAK3 to drive T-cell transformation and T-ALL development. Gene expression profiling integrated with ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data established that inactivation of Suz12 led to increased PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and WNT signaling. Moreover, a drug screen revealed that JAK3/Suz12 mutant leukemia cells were more sensitive to histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 inhibition than JAK3 mutant leukemia cells. Among the broad genome and gene expression changes observed on Suz12 inactivation, our integrated analysis identified the PI3K/mTOR, VEGF/VEGF receptor, and HDAC6/HSP90 pathways as specific vulnerabilities in T-ALL cells with combined JAK3 and SUZ12 mutations.","['Broux, Michael', 'Prieto, Cristina', 'Demeyer, Sofie', 'Vanden Bempt, Marlies', 'Alberti-Servera, Llucia', 'Lodewijckx, Inge', 'Vandepoel, Roel', 'Mentens, Nicole', 'Gielen, Olga', 'Jacobs, Kris', 'Geerdens, Ellen', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'de Bock, Charles E', 'Cools, Jan']","['Broux M', 'Prieto C', 'Demeyer S', 'Vanden Bempt M', 'Alberti-Servera L', 'Lodewijckx I', 'Vandepoel R', 'Mentens N', 'Gielen O', 'Jacobs K', 'Geerdens E', 'Vicente C', 'de Bock CE', 'Cools J']",,"['VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Pamplona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Pamplona, Spain; and.', 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Randwick, Australia."", 'VIB Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6888143,,,2019/09/08 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)74044-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000015 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Oct 17;134(16):1323-1336. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000015.,20200205,1323-1336,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Suz12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Hierarchical models and permutation procedures for testing multiple random effects were applied on both data from an observational cohort (the TRIAL-OH study: 703 patients, 17 ICUs) and a randomized controlled trial (the HIGH trial: 776 patients, 31 ICUs) to characterize ICU variation in intubation risk across centers. RESULTS: The crude intubation rate varied across ICUs from 29 to 80% in the observational cohort and from 0 to 86% in the RCT. This center effect on the mean ICU intubation rate was statistically significant, even after adjustment on individual patient characteristics (observational cohort: p value = 0.013, median OR 1.48 [1.30-1.72]; RCT: p value 0.004, median OR 1.51 [1.36-1.68]). Two ICU-level characteristics were associated with intubation risk (the annual rate of intubation procedure per center and the time from respiratory symptoms to ICU admission) and could partly explain this center effect. In the RCT that controlled for the use of high-flow oxygen therapy, we did not find significant variation in the effect of oxygenation strategy on intubation risk across centers, despite a significant variation in the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Intubation rates varied considerably among ICUs, even after adjustment on individual characteristics.","['Dumas, Guillaume', 'Demoule, Alexandre', 'Mokart, Djamel', 'Lemiale, Virginie',

Despite having significant genomic organizational and structural similarities, the closely related human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-2 (HTLV-2) is considered apathogenic and has been linked with benign lymphoproliferation and mild neurological symptoms in certain infected patients. The silencing of proviral gene expression and maintenance of latency are central for the establishment of persistent infections in vivo. The conserved pX sequences of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 encode several ancillary factors which have been shown to negatively regulate proviral gene expression, while simultaneously activating host cellular proliferative and pro-survival pathways. In particular, the ORF-II proteins, HTLV-1 p30(II) and HTLV-2 p28(II), suppress Tax-dependent transactivation from the viral promoter-whereas p30(II) also inhibits PU.1-mediated inflammatory-signaling, differentially augments the expression of p53-regulated metabolic/pro-survival genes, and induces lymphoproliferation which could promote mitotic proviral replication. The ubiquitinated form of the HTLV-1 p13(II) protein localizes to nuclear speckles and interferes with recruitment of the p300 coactivator by the viral transactivator Tax. Further, the antisense-encoded HTLV-1 HBZ and HTLV-2 APH-2 proteins and mRNAs negatively regulate Tax-dependent proviral gene expression and activate inflammatory signaling associated with enhanced T-cell lymphoproliferation. This review will summarize our current understanding of the pX latency-maintenance factors of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 and discuss how these products may contribute to the differences in pathogenicity between the human PTLVs.","['Harrod, Robert']",['Harrod R'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-0808-0343'],"['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, USA. rharrod@smu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R15 CA202265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R15CA202265-01A1/National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of', 'Health/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190906,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC6731619,['NOTNLM'],"['*APH-2', '*ATLL', '*HAM/TSP', '*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-2', '*Tax', '*p13II', '*p28II', '*p30II']",2019/09/08 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0487-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0487-9 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Sep 6;16(1):25. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0487-9.,20200309,25,,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'HTLV-II Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*genetics', '*Virus Latency']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Publications indexed in databases of biomedical literature were analyzed. Potential publication bias was evaluated by analyzing the standard error in funnel plots using the estimated relative risk (RR). Mixed-effect models were used to obtain the consolidated RR. All analyses were conducted using the R statistical software package. We used 24 publications in the final meta-analysis. Of 1005 males and 1376 females included in these 24 publications, 645 had FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations. Information on FLT3-D835 mutations was available in 10 publications for 175 patients. Concurrent occurrence of the two mutations was rare. WBC count at diagnosis was >/=10 x 10(9)/L in 351 patients. For patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation, RR was 0.59 for overall survival (OS) and 1.62 for death during induction. For those with FLT3-D835 mutations, the RR was 0.50 for OS and 1.77 for death during induction. RR for WBC count >/=10 x 10(9)/L was 3.29 and 1.48 for patients with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835, respectively. APL patients with FLT3-ITD or FLT3-D835 are more likely to present with elevated WBC counts and poorer prognosis than those without these mutations.","['Picharski, Gledson L', 'Andrade, Diancarlos P', 'Fabro, Ana Luiza M R', 'Lenzi, Luana', 'Tonin, Fernanda S', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Figueiredo, Bonald C']","['Picharski GL', 'Andrade DP', 'Fabro ALMR', 'Lenzi L', 'Tonin FS', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Figueiredo BC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2346-7194', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4262-8608', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1051-2056']","['Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, 1532 Silva Jardim, AV., Curitiba, Parana 80250-200, Brazil.', 'Faculdades Pequeno Principe, 333 Iguacu Av., Reboucas, Curitiba, Parana 80230-902, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, 1532 Silva Jardim, AV., Curitiba, Parana 80250-200, Brazil.', 'Faculdades Pequeno Principe, 333 Iguacu Av., Reboucas, Curitiba, Parana 80230-902, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, 1532 Silva Jardim, AV., Curitiba, Parana 80250-200, Brazil.', 'Faculdades Pequeno Principe, 333 Iguacu Av., Reboucas, Curitiba, Parana 80230-902, Brazil.', 'Unidade de Hematologia e Oncologia Pequeno Principe Hospital, 1070 Dsembargador Motta Av., Curitiba, Parana 80250-060, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, 1532 Silva Jardim, AV., Curitiba, Parana 80250-200, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, 632 Pref Lothario Meissner Av., Curitiba, Parana 80210-170, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, 632 Pref Lothario Meissner Av., Curitiba, Parana 80210-170, Brazil.', ""Department of Oncology, Leukemia and Lymphoma Division, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. raul.ribeiro@stjude.org."", 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, 1532 Silva Jardim, AV., Curitiba, Parana 80250-200, Brazil. bonald@ufpr.br.', 'Faculdades Pequeno Principe, 333 Iguacu Av., Reboucas, Curitiba, Parana 80230-902, Brazil. bonald@ufpr.br.', 'Centro de Genetica Molecular e Pesquisa do Cancer em Criancas (CEGEMPAC), 400 Agostinho Leao Jr. Av., Curitiba, Parana 80030-110, Brazil. bonald@ufpr.br.', 'Departamento de Saude Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Parana, 260 Padre Camargo St., Centro, Curitiba, Parana 80060-240, Brazil. bonald@ufpr.br.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190905,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC6770268,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'FLT3-D835', 'FLT3-ITD', 'WBC', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia']",2019/09/08 06:00,2019/09/08 06:01,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11091311 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11091311 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Sep 5;11(9). pii: cancers11091311. doi: 10.3390/cancers11091311.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caramel is one of the most worldwide consumed additives and it is produced by heating natural carbohydrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the food safety and the possible nutraceutical potential of caramel colour class IV (CAR). For this purpose, in vivo toxicity/antitoxicity, genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity and longevity assays were performed using the Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, cytotoxicity, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, single cell gel electrophoresis and methylation status assays were conducted in the in vitro HL-60 human leukaemia cell line. Our results reported that CAR was neither toxic nor genotoxic and showed antigenotoxic effects in Drosophila. Furthermore, CAR induced cytotoxicity and hipomethylated sat-alpha repetitive element using HL-60 cell line. In conclusion, the food safety of CAR was demonstrated, since Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) was not reached in toxicity assay and any of the tested concentrations induced mutation rates higher than that of the concurrent control in D. melanogaster. On the other hand, CAR protected DNA from oxidative stress provided by hydrogen peroxide in Drosophila. Moreover, CAR showed chemopreventive activity and modified the methylation status of HL-60 cell line. Nevertheless, much more information about the mechanisms of gene therapies related to epigenetic modulation by food is necessary.","['Mateo-Fernandez, Marcos', 'Alves-Martinez, Pilar', 'Del Rio-Celestino, Mercedes', 'Font, Rafael', 'Merinas-Amo, Tania', 'Alonso-Moraga, Angeles']","['Mateo-Fernandez M', 'Alves-Martinez P', 'Del Rio-Celestino M', 'Font R', 'Merinas-Amo T', 'Alonso-Moraga A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9130-2669', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1091-3527']","['Department of Genetic, Rabanales Campus, University of Cordoba (UCO), 14071 Cordoba, Spain. mercedes.rio.celestino@juntadeandalucia.es.', 'Department of Genetic, Rabanales Campus, University of Cordoba (UCO), 14071 Cordoba, Spain.', 'Agri-Food Laboratory, Council of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development of Andalusia (CAPDER), 14004 Cordoba, Spain.', 'Agri-Food Laboratory, Council of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development of Andalusia (CAPDER), 14004 Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Genetic, Rabanales Campus, University of Cordoba (UCO), 14071 Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Genetic, Rabanales Campus, University of Cordoba (UCO), 14071 Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190905,Switzerland,Foods,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",101670569,PMC6770427,['NOTNLM'],"['caramel colour E150d-Class IV (CAR)', 'food safety', 'nutraceutical potential']",2019/09/08 06:00,2019/09/08 06:01,['2019/09/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['foods8090392 [pii]', '10.3390/foods8090392 [doi]']",epublish,Foods. 2019 Sep 5;8(9). pii: foods8090392. doi: 10.3390/foods8090392.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the new era of bioinformatics, which integrates different aspects, drug development has been tremendously improved. Recently, extensive research was directed towards the rational modification of steroid molecules against different disease especially cancer. Moreover, heterocyclic steroid derivatives have shown a lot of different biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. Molecular docking methods can be used to explore how the steroid derivatives conformations can adopt within the binding sites of specific macromolecular targets involved in cancer progression. We conducted this study to investigate the accuracy of different molecular docking calculations using different steroidal molecular targets, and to define the most accurate one to study the mode of action of steroid derivatives as potential anti-cancer drugs. Our results revealed that the Dock6, PLANTS, AutoDock, GLIDE (SP and XP), and GOLD (ASP, Chemscore, and PLP) software were able to maintain the binding mode of the co-crystallized ligands inside their proteins by achieving RMSD values lower than two. Moreover, molecular docking study revealed that compound 4, and 5 are promising steroidal derivatives as anti-cancer drugs. Further on, the cytotoxic activity of the selected steroidal derivatives were tested against leukemia cell line using MTT assay. The results revealed that compound 4, and 5 were potential cytotoxic agents against THP-1 cells (IC50s were 44.67microM, and 46.77microM, respectively), these results are in agreement with the molecular docking study.","['Nafie, Mohamed S', 'Tantawy, Mohamed A', 'Elmgeed, Gamal A']","['Nafie MS', 'Tantawy MA', 'Elmgeed GA']",,"['Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt.', 'Hormones Department, Medical Research Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt; Stem Cells Lab, Center of Excellence for Advanced Sciences, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt.

Out of six different STAT proteins, STAT5 plays its main role in hematopoiesis and constitutive STAT5 activation seems to be a key event in the pathogenesis of several hematological malignancies. This has led many researchers to develop compounds capable of inhibiting STAT5 activation or interfering with its functions. Several anti-STAT5 molecules have shown potent STAT5 inhibitory activity in vitro. However, compared to the large amount of clinical studies with JAK inhibitors that are currently widely used in the clinics to treat myeloproliferative disorders, the clinical trials with STAT5 inhibitors are very limited. At present, a few STAT5 inhibitors are in phase I or II clinical trials for the treatment of leukemias and graft vs host disease. These studies seem to indicate that such compounds could be well tolerated and useful in reducing the occurrence of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia. Of interest, STAT5 seems to play an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal suggesting that combination therapies including STAT5 inhibitors can erode the cancer stem cell pool and possibly open the way for the complete cancer eradication. In this review, we discuss the implication of STAT5 in hematological malignancies and the results obtained with the novel STAT5 inhibitors.","['Tolomeo, Manlio', 'Meli, Maria', 'Grimaudo, Stefania']","['Tolomeo M', 'Meli M', 'Grimaudo S']",,"['Department of Health Promotion Sciences, Maternal and Infant Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion Sciences, Maternal and Infant Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion Sciences, Maternal and Infant Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*FLT3-ITD', '*Jak2V617F', '*STAT transcription factors', '*STAT5 inhibitors', '*leukemia.']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/08/07 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-100708 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190906160848 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(17):2036-2046. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190906160848.,20200806,2036-2046,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Insights into the oncogenic constitutive activity of the Lbc RhoGEF were gained by analyzing the structure and dynamics of the protein in different functional states and in comparison with a close homologue, leukemia-associated RhoGEF. Higher intrinsic flexibility, less dense and extended structure network, and less stable allosteric communication pathways in Lbc, compared to the nonconstitutively active homologue, emerged as major determinants of the constitutive activity. Independent of the state, the essential dynamics of the two RhoGEFs is contributed by the last 10 amino acids of Dbl homology (DH) and the whole pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and tends to be equalized by the presence of RhoA. The catalytic activity of the RhoGEF relies on the scaffolding action of the DH domain that primarily turns the switch I (SWI) of RhoA on itself through highly conserved amino acids participating in the stability core and essential for function. Changes in the conformation of SWI and disorganization of the RhoA regions deputed to nucleotide binding are among the major RhoGEF effects leading to GDP release. Binding of RhoA reorganizes the allosteric communication on RhoGEF, strengthening the communication among the canonical RhoA binding site on DH, a secondary RhoA binding site on PH, and the binding site for heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting dual roles for RhoA as a catalysis substrate and as a regulatory protein. The structure network-based analysis tool employed in this study proved to be useful for predicting potentially druggable regulatory sites in protein structures.","['Felline, Angelo', 'Belmonte, Luca', 'Raimondi, Francesco', 'Bellucci, Luca', 'Fanelli, Francesca']","['Felline A', 'Belmonte L', 'Raimondi F', 'Bellucci L', 'Fanelli F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7977-9170', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7620-6895']","['Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , via Campi 103 , 41125 Modena , Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , via Campi 103 , 41125 Modena , Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , via Campi 103 , 41125 Modena , Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , via Campi 103 , 41125 Modena , Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , via Campi 103 , 41125 Modena , Italy.', 'Center for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , via Campi 287 , 41125 Modena , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190925,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00271 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2019 Oct 28;59(10):4300-4313. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00271.

We conducted this Phase one study in relapsed/refractory NHL and CLL patients. During expansion, each arm enrolled to disease-specific cohorts to assess efficacy. Arm one received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) IV weekly for two 4-week cycles plus duvelisib until progression/intolerance. Arm two received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) IV Day one, bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) IV (NHL patients) or 70 mg/m(2) IV (CLL patients) Days one-two for six cycles, plus duvelisib until progression/intolerance. Duvelisib doses of 50 mg and 75 mg BID were tested during dose escalation. Forty-six patients (27 NHL, 19 CLL) were treated. The adverse events of the drug combinations were consistent with single agent toxicities. The most common AEs were neutropenia (47.7%), fatigue (41.3%), and rash (41.3%). A duvelisib expansion dose of 25 mg BID was chosen based on the monotherapy phase one study, IPI-145-02, which confirmed that dose for further clinical development. Overall response rate was 71.8%. Median progression-free survival was 13.7 months. Median overall survival has not been reached, but 30-month overall survival probability was 62%.

We previously observed that patients with complaints of headache or photophobia during corticosteroid administration had high intraocular pressure (IOP). PROCEDURE: We measured IOP during corticosteroid administration in 15 patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma undergoing treatment at our institution from January 2016 to December 2018. IOP was measured by an ophthalmologist within seven days of the initiation of standard dose of corticosteroid, which was defined as 60 mg/m(2) /day for prednisolone and 10 mg/m(2) /day for dexamethasone. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received 52 courses of chemotherapy containing corticosteroids. IOP exceeded 21 mmHg among 13 patients in 28 courses. Twelve of the 13 patients were administered topical treatment, and six of the 12 patients needed additional diuretic agents. IOP during the chemotherapy courses containing dexamethasone was significantly higher compared with IOP during the chemotherapy courses containing prednisolone. Only two patients complained of symptoms, such as headache and photophobia, and one of the two patients underwent trabeculotomy. Funduscopic findings were normal in all patients. There was a dose-associated decrease in IOP with reduction of dexamethasone dose. CONCLUSIONS: IOP should be measured during administration of substantial corticosteroid doses even in patients with no symptoms. Further investigations regarding the level of IOP for intervention need to be conducted.","['Sugiyama, Minako', 'Terashita, Yukayo', 'Hara, Kazuya', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Iguchi, Akihiro', 'Chin, Shinki', 'Manabe, Atsushi']","['Sugiyama M', 'Terashita Y', 'Hara K', 'Cho Y', 'Iguchi A', 'Chin S', 'Manabe A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3075-2097', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1367-3883']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190906,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*corticosteroid-induced glaucoma', '*dexamethasone', '*hematological malignancy']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27977 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Dec;66(12):e27977. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27977.

However, the large size and missing hydration structure of target-ligand complexes often hinder such optimizations with quantum mechanical (QM) methods. At the same time, QM calculations are often necessitated for proper handling of electronic effects. To overcome the above problems, and help the QM design of new drugs, a protocol is introduced for atomic level determination of hydration structure and extraction of structures of target-ligand complex interfaces. The protocol is a combination of a previously published program MobyWat, an engine for assigning explicit water positions, and Fragmenter, a new tool for optimal fragmentation of protein targets. The protocol fostered a series of fast calculations of ligand binding enthalpies at the semi-empirical QM level. Ligands of diverse chemistry ranging from small aromatic compounds up to a large peptide helix of a molecular weight of 3000 targeting a leukemia protein were selected for systematic investigations. Comparison of various combinations of implicit and explicit water models demonstrated that the presence of accurately predicted explicit water molecules in the complex interface considerably improved the agreement with experimental results. A single scaling factor was derived for conversion of QM reaction heats into binding enthalpy values. The factor links molecular structure with binding thermodynamics via QM calculations. The new protocol and scaling factor will help automated optimization of binding enthalpy in future molecular design projects.","['Horvath, Istvan', 'Jeszenoi, Norbert', 'Balint, Monika', 'Paragi, Gabor', 'Hetenyi, Csaba']","['Horvath I', 'Jeszenoi N', 'Balint M', 'Paragi G', 'Hetenyi C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5408-1748'],"['Chemistry Doctoral School, University of Szeged, Dugonics ter 13, 6720 Szeged, Hungary. horvathi@gmx.de.', 'Institute of Physiology, Medical School, University of Pecs, Szigeti ut 12, 7624 Pecs, Hungary. jnorbert88@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Medical School, University of Pecs, Szigeti ut 12, 7624 Pecs, Hungary. monibalint18@gmail.com.', 'MTA-SZTE Biomimetic Systems Research Group, Dom ter 8, 6720 Szeged, Hungary. paragi@sol.cc.u-szeged.hu.', 'Institute of Physics, University of Pecs, Ifjusag utja 6, 7624 Pecs, Hungary. paragi@sol.cc.u-szeged.hu.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Medical School, University of Pecs, Szigeti ut 12, 7624 Pecs, Hungary. hetenyi.csaba@pte.hu.']",['eng'],"['K123836/Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office', 'K112807/Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office', 'molkot/Governmental Information Technology Development Agency', '17886-4/23018/FEKUTSTRAT/University of Pecs', 'EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00008/Hungary and the European Union']",['Journal Article'],20190906,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6770515,['NOTNLM'],"['affinity', 'binding', 'correlation', 'design', 'interaction', 'optimization', 'peptide', 'structure', 'water']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20184384 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20184384 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Sep 6;20(18). pii: ijms20184384. doi: 10.3390/ijms20184384.,20200204,,,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Solvents)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",IM,"['Biophysical Phenomena', '*Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Molecular Structure', '*Quantum Theory', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Water/chemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the differentiation properties of human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) transfected with recombinant adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein cardiotrophin-1 (Adv-EGFP-CT-1) and the possible mechanisms involved. Cells were isolated, and MSC immunophenotypes were confirmed. The resulting differentiated cells treated with Adv-EGFP-CT-1 and cultured in neural induction medium (NIM) expressed higher levels of Nestin, neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) markers than cells in other treatments. Expression of glycoprotein 130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (gp130/LiFRbeta), Raf-1, phosphorylated Raf-1 (p-Raf-1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) increased gradually within 72 h after transfection with Adv-EGFP-CT-1 and NIM culture. Additionally, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) abrogated expression of p-ERK1/2, Nestin, GFAP and NeuN. Thus, the ERK1/2 pathway may contribute to CT1-stimulated neural differentiation of hUCB-MSCs.","['Lang, Changhui', 'Shu, Xiaomei', 'Peng, Longying', 'Yu, Xiaohua']","['Lang C', 'Shu X', 'Peng L', 'Yu X']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, 563003, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, 563003, Guizhou, China. shuxiaomei1993@sina.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, 563003, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, 563003, Guizhou, China.']",['eng'],['31260286/Foundation for the National nature science'],['Journal Article'],20190905,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,PMC6787130,['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiotrophin-1', 'ERK/MAPK signaling pathway', 'Neuron-like cells', 'Umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells']",2019/09/07 06:00,2019/09/07 06:01,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:01 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10616-019-00339-w [doi]', '10.1007/s10616-019-00339-w [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2019 Oct;71(5):977-988. doi: 10.1007/s10616-019-00339-w.

Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out at Department of Hematology, Army Medical College Rawalpindi, in collaboration with Military Hospital Rawalpindi and Armed Forces institute of Pathology Rawalpindi from 1st January 2018 to 1st October 2018. Sample size of 64 was calculated using WHO calculator. Age and gender of patients was noted. Frequency of autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pure red cell aplasia and autoimmune agranulocytosis were determined in diagnosed patients of chronic lymphocytic leukemia by various laboratory tests in our study population. Results: A total of 64 patients were included in the study, 53 (82.8%) were males and 11(17.2%) were females. Mean age of patients was 65 years. Autoimmune hemolytic anaemia was observed in 5/64 (7.8%) of patients. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura was seen in 2/64 (3.1%) patients. Autoimmune granuloytopenia and pure red cell aplasia were not seen in any patient. Conclusion: Autoimmune hemolytic anaemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura are the most common causes of immune cytopenias in patients of CLL. Immune cytopenias should always be identified by laboratory tests as their management differs from other cytopenias which occur due to various other causes.","['Haider, M Shabih', 'Khan, Saleem Ahmed', 'Nasiruddin', 'Shahid, Samra']","['Haider MS', 'Khan SA', 'Nasiruddin', 'Shahid S']",,"['Dr. Mohammad Shabih Haider, MBBS, Department of Pathology (Haematology Section), Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Dr. Saleem Ahmed Khan, FCPS, Department of Pathology (Haematology Section), Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Dr. Nasiruddin, FCPS, Department of Pathology (Haematology Section), Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Dr. Samra Shahid FCPS, Department of Pathology (Haematology Section), Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,Pak J Med Sci,Pakistan journal of medical sciences,100913117,PMC6717446,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmune granulocytopenia', 'Autoimmune hemolytic anaemia', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Immune thrombocytopenic purpura', 'Pure red cell aplasia']",2019/09/07 06:00,2019/09/07 06:01,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12669/pjms.35.5.369 [doi]', 'PJMS-35-1334 [pii]']",ppublish,Pak J Med Sci. 2019 Sep-Oct;35(5):1334-1338. doi: 10.12669/pjms.35.5.369.,,1334-1338,,,,,['Conflict of interest: None'],,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the outcomes of 94 consecutive patients aged between 14 and 22 who underwent myeloablative matched related-donor transplant while in first or second complete remission. We studied the impact of disease type, remission status, ELN risk group, ABO mismatch, time from diagnosis to transplant, patient and donor age, conditioning type, stem cell source, and the year of transplant on transplant outcomes. The cumulative incidences of relapse, NRM, OS, and DFS at 5 years were 42%, 10%, 59%, and 48%, respectively. Absence of ABO mismatch and donor age > 20 were associated with better OS and DFS on univariate and multivariate analysis. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD were 18% and 44%, respectively. Donor age > 20 and peripheral blood stem cell source were significantly associated with higher incidence of cGVHD on univariate and multivariate analysis.

However, some patients are still suffering from relapse and drug resistance, which urges better understanding of the growth/survival mechanisms of CML stem/progenitor cells. In the present study, the role and its underlying mechanism of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like (HNRPDL) in CML cells were investigated. Firstly, overexpression of HNRPDL promoted the growth of murine BaF3 cells in vitro and induced leukemia in vivo, which was enhanced by co-expression of BCR-ABL. Conversely, HNRPDL silencing inhibited colony-forming cell (CFC) production of CML CD34(+) cells and attenuated BCR-ABL induced leukemia. In addition, HNRPDL modulated imatinib response of K562 cells and HNRPDL silencing sensitized CML CD34(+) cells to imatinib treatment. Mechanistically, we found the stability of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) mRNA was sustained by HNRPDL through its binding to a specific motif (ACUAGC) in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PBX1. The expression of PBX1 was significantly higher in CML CD34(+) cells than that in control cells and PBX silencing inhibited the growth of CML cells and sensitized them to imatinib treatment. In contrast, overexpression of PBX1 elevated the CFC production of normal hematopoietic CD34(+) cells and ""rescued"" HNRPDL silencing induced growth inhibition and imatinib sensitization. Taken together, our data have demonstrated that HNRPDL transforms hematopoietic cells and a novel HNRPDL/PBX1 axis plays an important role in human CML CD34(+) cells.","['Ji, Dehuan', 'Zhang, Pengshan', 'Ma, Wenjuan', 'Fei, Yiwen', 'Xue, Wen', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiuyan', 'Zhou, Haixia', 'Zhao, Yun']","['Ji D', 'Zhang P', 'Ma W', 'Fei Y', 'Xue W', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou H', 'Zhao Y']",,"['Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, 215006, Suzhou, China. zhouhaixia@suda.edu.cn.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, 215123, Suzhou, China. zhaoy@suda.edu.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, 215006, Suzhou, China. zhaoy@suda.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190905,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0998-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0998-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Jan;39(2):443-453. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0998-9.

The aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression associated with such conditions and their psychophysical predictors before and after HCT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study using self-descriptive tools. The questionnaires: LOT-R, AIS, Mini-Mac, CECS, RSCL and HADS were filled by 60 patients with acute leukaemia before and after HCT. RESULTS: Anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated positively with psychological symptom distress. The correlation with depressive symptoms was weak, however, with anxious symptoms was moderate. In both cases, the higher was a level of psychological symptom distress, the higher level of anxiety and depression was observed in patients. The results indicated the weak, positive correlation between onerousness of physical symptoms and a level of anxiety. The greater was the severity of physical symptoms, the higher was the level of anxiety. The negative predictor of anxious symptoms was control of anxiety but it was weakly associated with a lower level of the explained variable. The negative predictor of anxious symptoms was also dispositional optimism whose high level accompanied the lower severity of the explained variable. However, the positive predictor of anxious symptoms was the variable of onerousness of symptoms whose high level accompanied the higher severity of anxious symptoms in the examined group CONCLUSION: Patients with acute leukemia who are hospitalized for HCT require detailed monitoring of their psychological distress to introduce the proper psychological and pharmacological interventions that reduce anxiety as well as boost ""dispositional optimism"" and mechanisms of control.","['Warchala, Anna', 'Krupka-Matuszczyk, Irena', 'Krysta, Krzysztof']","['Warchala A', 'Krupka-Matuszczyk I', 'Krysta K']",,"['Department of Psychiatry Rehabilitation, Medical School of Silesia, Ziolowa 45/47, 40-635 Katowice, Poland, awarchala@sum.edu.pl.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Psychiatr Danub,Psychiatria Danubina,9424753,,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Danub. 2019 Sep;31(Suppl 3):231-236.,20191023,231-236,,,IM,"['Anxiety/*complications', 'Depression/*complications', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*psychology/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,,,,,,

While the SP/NK-1R signaling axis is involved in the pathogenesis of solid cancer, the role of this signaling pathway in hematological malignancy remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NK-1R expression is markedly elevated in the white blood cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients and a panel of human leukemia cell lines. Blocking NK-1R induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo via increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. This oxidative stress was triggered by rapid calcium flux from the endoplasmic reticulum into mitochondria and, consequently, impairment of mitochondrial function, a mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of NK-1R antagonists. Besides anticancer activity, blocking NK-1R produces a potent antinociceptive effect in myeloid leukemia-induced bone pain by alleviating inflammation and inducing apoptosis. These findings thus raise the exciting possibility that the NK-1R antagonists, drugs currently used in the clinic for preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, may provide a therapeutic option for treating human myeloid leukemia.","['Ge, Chentao', 'Huang, Hemiao', 'Huang, Feiyan', 'Yang, Tianxin', 'Zhang, Tengfei', 'Wu, Hongzhang', 'Zhou, Hanwei', 'Chen, Qi', 'Shi, Yue', 'Sun, Yanfang', 'Liu, Liangjue', 'Wang, Xi', 'Pearson, Richard B', 'Cao, Yihai', 'Kang, Jian', 'Fu, Caiyun']","['Ge C', 'Huang H', 'Huang F', 'Yang T', 'Zhang T', 'Wu H', 'Zhou H', 'Chen Q', 'Shi Y', 'Sun Y', 'Liu L', 'Wang X', 'Pearson RB', 'Cao Y', 'Kang J', 'Fu C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9998-4975'],"['Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of TCM, 310006 Hangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Province People's Hospital, 310014 Hangzhou, China."", 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of TCM, 310006 Hangzhou, China.', ""Department of Oncology, The People's Liberation Army No. 903rd Hospital, 310013 Hangzhou, China."", 'Oncogenic Signalling and Growth Control Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia; fucy03@zstu.edu.cn jian.kang@petermac.org yihai.cao@ki.se rick.pearson@petermac.org.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institute, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden fucy03@zstu.edu.cn jian.kang@petermac.org yihai.cao@ki.se rick.pearson@petermac.org.', 'Oncogenic Signalling and Growth Control Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia; fucy03@zstu.edu.cn jian.kang@petermac.org yihai.cao@ki.se rick.pearson@petermac.org.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 310018 Hangzhou, China; fucy03@zstu.edu.cn jian.kang@petermac.org yihai.cao@ki.se rick.pearson@petermac.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190905,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC6765257,['NOTNLM'],"['*leukemia', '*mitochondrial calcium fluxes', '*neurokinin-1 receptor', '*oxidative stress']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['1908998116 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1908998116 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Sep 24;116(39):19635-19645. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1908998116.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of RX-5902 in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to explore effects on beta-catenin expression. A panel of 18 TNBC cell lines was exposed to RX-5902, and changes in proliferation, apoptosis, cellular ploidy, and effector protein expression were assessed. Gene expression profiling was used in sensitive and resistant cell lines with pathway analysis to explore pathways associated with sensitivity to RX-5902. The activity of RX-5902 was confirmed in vivo in cell line and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models. RX-5902 demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in vitro against TNBC cell lines with an average IC50 of 56 nmol/L in sensitive cell lines. RX-5902 treatment resulted in the induction of apoptosis, G2-M cell-cycle arrest, and aneuploidy in a subset of cell lines. RX-5902 was active in vivo against TNBC PDX models, and treatment resulted in a decrease in nuclear beta-catenin. RX-5902 exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and plasma and tumor tissue in nude mice. Pathway analysis demonstrated an increase in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), TGFbeta, and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways associated with sensitivity to RX-5902. RX-5902 is active against in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of TNBC. Target engagement was confirmed with decreases in nuclear beta-catenin and MCL-1 observed, confirming the proposed mechanism of action.

Treatment of M pneumoniae pneumonia with macrolides is widespread and can lead to the development of macrolide resistance. The clinical consequences of chronic M pneumoniae carriage are unknown. In this article, we describe a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed macrolide-susceptible M pneumoniae pneumonia confirmed by nasopharyngeal secretions polymerase chain reaction and culture with good response to azithromycin. Five months later, the patient developed another M pneumoniae pneumonia that was diagnosed with positive macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae polymerase chain reaction and culture from the bronchoalveolar lavage. The child responded well to fluoroquinolones and eventually was discharged from the hospital. The M pneumoniae recovered from the second pneumonia is a novel strain and is genetically identical to the M pneumoniae that caused the first pneumonia, apart from the macrolide-resistance 23S ribosomal RNA gene. Both isolates are identical in both P1 (subtype 2 with a novel variant, 2bv) and multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis type (53662). This is indicative of chronic M pneumoniae carriage with de novo macrolide-resistance mutation and subsequent breakthrough pneumonia that is reported for the first time here. Children with immunosuppression may be at increased risk of life-threatening macrolide-resistant pneumonia after M pneumoniae carriage. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of this phenomenon. This will then guide strategies to limit the associated morbidity, such as testing for macrolide resistance, treatment of M pneumoniae pneumonia in high-risk children with bactericidal antibiotics (such as fluoroquinolones), and possibly eradication protocols of M pneumoniae carriage to prevent subsequent life-threatening infections.","['Alishlash, Ammar Saadoon', 'Atkinson, Thomas Prescott', 'Schlappi, Charles', 'Leal, Sixto M Jr', 'Waites, Ken B', 'Xiao, Li']","['Alishlash AS', 'Atkinson TP', 'Schlappi C', 'Leal SM Jr', 'Waites KB', 'Xiao L']",,"['Departments of Pediatrics, ammarsaadoon@uabmc.edu.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pathology, and.', 'Pathology, and.', 'Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20190905,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['peds.2019-1642 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2019-1642 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2019 Oct;144(4). pii: peds.2019-1642. doi: 10.1542/peds.2019-1642.

We used the ability of IL6 to inhibit the clonal proliferation of the mouse M1 myeloid leukemia cell line in agar to positively screen a cDNA expression library for proteins that inhibited IL6 activity. We found three clones completely resistant to IL6 that contained the cDNA for the Membrane-Associated RING-CH E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH2. MARCH2 is a member of a family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligases that target cell surface receptors for degradation. MARCH2 overexpressing M1 clones retained responsiveness to the related cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M and we showed that its inhibitory effect was a result of selective down-regulation of the IL6 receptor alpha chain and not the shared receptor subunit, gp130 or other signalling molecules. This activity of MARCH2 was also shared with related proteins MARCH4, MARCH9 and an isoform of MARCH3. The transmembrane domains and C-terminal domains, as well as a functional RING domain, of MARCH proteins were all required for substrate recognition and down-regulation. Genetic deletion of individual MARCH proteins in mice had no or little effect on IL6Ralpha levels but combined deletions of MARCH2,3 and 4 displayed elevated steady-state levels of IL6Ralpha in selected haemopoietic cell subsets including CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. These studies extend the potential immunosuppressive roles of MARCH proteins to include down-regulation of IL6 inflammatory responses.","['Babon, Jeffrey J', 'Stockwell, Dina', 'DiRago, Ladina', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Laktyushin, Artem', 'Villadangos, Jose', 'Ching, Alan', 'Ishido, Satoshi', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Nicola, Nicos A']","['Babon JJ', 'Stockwell D', 'DiRago L', 'Zhang JG', 'Laktyushin A', 'Villadangos J', 'Ching A', 'Ishido S', 'Hilton DJ', 'Alexander WS', 'Nicola NA']",,"['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hyogo College of Medicine, 1-1 Mukogawa-cho, Nishinomiya 663-8501, Japan.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cytokine receptors', '*cytokines', '*march proteins', '*ubiquitin ligases']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/07/11 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['220489 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20190577 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2019 Oct 15;476(19):2869-2882. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20190577.,20200710,2869-2882,"['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

Their diagnosis is challenging, with up to 30% of cases remaining unclassifiable and referred to as ""not otherwise specified"". We developed a reverse transcriptase-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification gene expression profiling assay to differentiate the main T-cell lymphoma entities and to study the heterogeneity of the ""not specified"" category. The test evaluates the expression of 20 genes, including 17 markers relevant to T-cell immunology and lymphoma biopathology, one Epstein-Barr virus-related transcript, and variants of RHOA (G17V) and IDH2 (R172K/T). By unsupervised hierarchical clustering, our assay accurately identified 21 of 21 ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas, 16 of 16 extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas, 6 of 6 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, and 13 of 13 adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas. ALK-negative anaplastic lymphomas (n=34) segregated into one cytotoxic cluster (n=10) and one non-cytotoxic cluster expressing Th2 markers (n=24) and enriched in DUSP22-rearranged cases. The 63 TFH-derived lymphomas divided into two subgroups according to a predominant TFH (n=50) or an enrichment in Th2 (n=13) signatures. We next developed a support vector machine predictor which attributed a molecular class to 27 of 77 not specified T-cell lymphomas: 17 TFH, five cytotoxic ALK-negative anaplastic and five NK/T-cell lymphomas. Among the remaining cases, we identified two cell-of-origin subgroups corresponding to cytotoxic/Th1 (n=19) and Th2 (n=24) signatures. A reproducibility test on 40 cases yielded a 90% concordance between three independent laboratories. This study demonstrates the applicability of a simple gene expression assay for the classification of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Its applicability to routinely-fixed samples makes it an attractive adjunct in diagnostic practice.","['Drieux, Fanny', 'Ruminy, Philippe', 'Abdel-Sater, Ahmad', 'Lemonnier, Francois', 'Viailly, Pierre-Julien', 'Fataccioli, Virginie', 'Marchand, Vinciane', 'Bisig, Bettina', 'Letourneau, Audrey', 'Parrens, Marie', 'Bossard, Celine', 'Bruneau, Julie', 'Dobay, Pamela', 'Veresezan, Liana', 'Dupuy, Aurelie', 'Pujals, Anais', 'Robe, Cyrielle', 'Sako, Nouhoum', 'Copie-Bergman, Christiane', 'Delfau-Larue, Marie-Helene', 'Picquenot, Jean-Michel', 'Tilly, Herve', 'Delarue, Richard', 'Jardin, Fabrice', 'de Leval, Laurence', 'Gaulard, Philippe']","['Drieux F', 'Ruminy P', 'Abdel-Sater A', 'Lemonnier F', 'Viailly PJ', 'Fataccioli V', 'Marchand V', 'Bisig B', 'Letourneau A', 'Parrens M', 'Bossard C', 'Bruneau J', 'Dobay P', 'Veresezan L', 'Dupuy A', 'Pujals A', 'Robe C', 'Sako N', 'Copie-Bergman C', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Picquenot JM', 'Tilly H', 'Delarue R', 'Jardin F', 'de Leval L', 'Gaulard P']",,"['INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France."", 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France philippe.ruminy@chb.unicancer.fr.', 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'Unite Hemopathies Lymphoides, Groupe Hospitalier Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Institut de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institut de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.', ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Hopital Haut-Leveque, CHU de Bordeaux, France."", ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, CHU de Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Hopital Universitaire Necker - Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France."", 'Institut de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France."", 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'Departement de Pathologie, Groupe Hospitalier Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', 'Departement de Pathologie, Groupe Hospitalier Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Creteil, France.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie et Immunologie Biologique, Groupe Hospitalier Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Creteil, France."", 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France."", 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Service Hematologie Adultes, Hopital Universitaire Necker - Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Institut de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'INSERM U955 and Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France philippe.gaulard@aphp.fr.', 'Departement de Pathologie, Groupe Hospitalier Henri Mondor, AP-HP, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190905,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7271600,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.226647 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.226647 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jun;105(6):1582-1592. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.226647.

PRIMA-1(Met)(APR-246,APR) is a methylated derivative of PRIMA-1, which induces apoptosis in human tumor cells through restoration of the transcriptional transactivation function of mutant p53. Here we show that low doses of APR on its own or in combination with AZA reactivate the p53 pathway and induce an apoptosis program. Functionally, we demonstrate that APR exerts these activities on its own and that it synergizes with AZA in TP53-mutated myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and in TP53-mutated primary cells from MDS/AML patients. Low doses of APR on its own or in combination with AZA also show significant efficacy in vivo Lastly, using transcriptomic analysis, we found that the APR + AZA synergy was mediated by downregulation of the FLT3 pathway in drug-treated cells. Activation of the FLT3 pathway by FLT3 ligand reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation by APR + AZA. These data suggest that TP53-mutated MDS/AML may be better targeted by the addition of APR-246 to conventional treatments.","['Maslah, Nabih', 'Salomao, Norman', 'Drevon, Louis', 'Verger, Emmanuelle', 'Partouche, Nicolas', 'Ly, Pierre', 'Aubin, Philippe', 'Naoui, Nadia', 'Schlageter, Marie-Helene', 'Bally, Cecile', 'Miekoutima, Elsa', 'Rahme, Ramy', 'Lehmann-Che, Jacqueline', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Giraudier, Stephane']","['Maslah N', 'Salomao N', 'Drevon L', 'Verger E', 'Partouche N', 'Ly P', 'Aubin P', 'Naoui N', 'Schlageter MH', 'Bally C', 'Miekoutima E', 'Rahme R', 'Lehmann-Che J', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P', 'Cassinat B', 'Giraudier S']",,"['APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'Faculte de Medecine Universite Paris Diderot Paris 7, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris 12-UPEC, Hopital Henri Mondor, APHP, Creteil.', 'APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', ""APHP, Service d'Hematologie Senior, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris."", ""APHP, Service d'Hematologie Senior, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris."", ""APHP, Service d'Hematologie Senior, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris."", 'Faculte de Medecine Universite Paris Diderot Paris 7, Paris.', ""Unite d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, APHP, Paris, France."", 'Faculte de Medecine Universite Paris Diderot Paris 7, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', ""APHP, Service d'Hematologie Senior, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris."", 'Faculte de Medecine Universite Paris Diderot Paris 7, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', ""APHP, Service d'Hematologie Senior, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris."", 'APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.', 'Faculte de Medecine Universite Paris Diderot Paris 7, Paris stephane.giraudier@aphp.fr.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190905,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7271596,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.218453 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.218453 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jun;105(6):1539-1551. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.218453.

These challenges may differentially impact on quality of life, coping ability and compliance to treatment. This especially holds true for haemato-oncological diseases. To date, psychological interventions have predominantly been developed for oncological patients however specific interventions for partners of haemato-oncological patients are rare. In this study we aim to conduct a psycho-oncological group-intervention for partners of patients with haemato-oncological diseases. The aim of the intervention is to significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in the partners and the patient, as well as enhancing dyadic coping. METHODS: The design of the INPART-study is an unblinded, randomised controlled trial with 2 treatment conditions (experimental and control) and assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months. It will be conducted at three study centres: the university medical centre's in Leipzig, Hannover and Ulm. The outcome criteria will be a reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as an improvement of dyadic coping. DISCUSSION: This trial shall provide information regarding the efficiency of a psycho-oncological intervention for partners of patients with haemato-oncological diseases and give references to the possible outcome in terms of dyadic coping and the reduction of mental strain. The study was supported by a grant from the German Jose Carreras Leukaemia Foundation.

Results from a French longitudinal observational study among older patients.,10.1186/s12885-019-6093-3 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Evidences support social inequalities in cancer survival. Studies on hematological malignancies, and more specifically Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), are sparser. Our study assessed: 1/ the influence of patients' socioeconomic position on survival, 2/ the role of treatment in this relationship, and 3/ the influence of patients' socioeconomic position on treatment utilization. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study includes all patients aged 60 and older, newly diagnosed with AML, excluding promyelocytic subtypes, between 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2014 in the South-West of France. Data came from medical files. Patients' socioeconomic position was measured by an ecological deprivation index, the European Deprivation Index. We studied first, patients' socioeconomic position influence on overall survival (n = 592), second, on the use of intensive chemotherapy (n = 592), and third, on the use of low intensive treatment versus best supportive care among patients judged unfit for intensive chemotherapy (n = 405). RESULTS: We found an influence of patients' socioeconomic position on survival (highest versus lowest position HRQ5: 1.39 [1.05;1.87] that was downsized to become no more significant after adjustment for AML ontogeny (HRQ5: 1.31[0.97;1.76] and cytogenetic prognosis HRQ5: 1.30[0.97;1.75]). The treatment was strongly associated with survival. A lower proportion of intensive chemotherapy was observed among patients with lowest socioeconomic position (ORQ5: 0.41[0.19;0.90]) which did not persist after adjustment for AML ontogeny (ORQ5: 0.59[0.25;1.40]). No such influence of patients' socioeconomic position was found on the treatment allocation among patients judged unfit for intensive chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, these results suggest an indirect influence of patients' socioeconomic position on survival through AML initial presentation.","['Berger, Eloise', 'Delpierre, Cyrille', 'Despas, Fabien', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Berard, Emilie', 'Bombarde, Oriane', 'Bories, Pierre', 'Sarry, Audrey', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Recher, Christian', 'Lamy, Sebastien']","['Berger E', 'Delpierre C', 'Despas F', 'Bertoli S', 'Berard E', 'Bombarde O', 'Bories P', 'Sarry A', 'Laurent G', 'Recher C', 'Lamy S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2412-1133'],"['LEASP, UMR 1027, Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de medecine de Purpan, Inserm-Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France. eloise.berger@univ-tlse3.fr.', 'LEASP, UMR 1027, Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de medecine de Purpan, Inserm-Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'LEASP, UMR 1027, Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de medecine de Purpan, Inserm-Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse - Oncopole, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'LEASP, UMR 1027, Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de medecine de Purpan, Inserm-Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Epidemiologie, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Service de Pharmacologie Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse - Oncopole, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Reseau regional de cancerologie Onco-Occitanie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse - Oncopole, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'LEASP, UMR 1027, Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de medecine de Purpan, Inserm-Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse - Oncopole, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Toulouse UMR 1037 Inserm / ERL5294 CNRS, University of Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'LEASP, UMR 1027, Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Faculte de medecine de Purpan, Inserm-Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['SSC201504/Institut de Recherche en Sante Publique', 'ANR-11-PHUC-001/Agence Nationale de la Recherche']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20190905,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6729078,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cancer management and survival', 'Elderly patients', 'French European deprivation index', 'Observational study']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6093-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6093-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Sep 5;19(1):883. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6093-3.,20200226,883,,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to generate a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector that has a high efficiency in gene transfer to megakaryocytic leukemic cells with anticancer potential. We first modified the rAd5 backbone vector with a chimeric fiber gene of Ad5 and Ad11p (rAd5F11p) to increase the gene delivery efficiency. Then, the nonstructural protein NS1 of human parvovirus B19 (B19V), which induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis, was cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector. As the expression of parvoviral NS1 protein inhibited Ad replication and production, we engineered the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which governs NS1 expression, with two tetracycline operator elements (TetO2). Transfection of the rAd5F11p proviral vectors in Tet repressor-expressing T-REx-293 cells produced rAd in a large quantity. We further evaluated this chimeric rAd5F11p vector in gene delivery in human leukemic cells, UT7/Epo-S1. Strikingly, the novel rAd5F11p-B19NS1-GFP vector, exhibited a transduction efficiency much higher than the original vector, rAd5-B19NS1-GFP, in UT7/Epo-S1 cells, in particular, when they were transduced at a relatively low multiplicity of infection (100 viral genome copies/cell). After the transduction of rAd5F11p-B19NS1-GFP, over 90% of the UT7/Epo-S1 cells were arrested at the G2/M phase, and approximately 40%-50% of the cells were undergoing apoptosis, suggesting the novel rAd5F11P-B19NS1-GFP vector holds a promise in therapeutic potentials of megakaryocytic leukemia.","['Xu, Peng', 'Wang, Xiaomei', 'Li, Yi', 'Qiu, Jianming']","['Xu P', 'Wang X', 'Li Y', 'Qiu J']",,"['Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan 430415, China. xupenghuashi@163.com.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA. xupenghuashi@163.com.', 'Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan 430415, China. wangxiaomei_wxm@126.com.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA. wangxiaomei_wxm@126.com.', 'Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan 430415, China. johnli2668@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA. jqiu@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,PMC6783920,['NOTNLM'],"['*adenoviral vector', '*anti-cancer', '*apoptosis', '*cell cycle arrest', '*parvovirus B19']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['v11090820 [pii]', '10.3390/v11090820 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2019 Sep 4;11(9). pii: v11090820. doi: 10.3390/v11090820.,20200903,,,['0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques/instrumentation', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using chemical and biological methods, we characterized the biological activity, identified cellular protein targets and defined the mechanism of action of the test dicarboximides. The reported IC50 values (concentration required to reduce cell survival fraction to 50% of control) of selected dicarboximides were similar or lower than IC50 of registered anticancer drugs, for example cytarabine, sorafenib, irinotecan. Test compounds induced apoptosis in chronic myelogenous (K562) and acute lymphoblastic (MOLT-4) leukemia cells by activation of receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and increased the expression of proapoptotic genes (BAX, NOXA, HTRA2, TNFRSF10B, ESRRBL1). Selected dicarboximides displayed immunomodulatory activity and downregulated IKZF1 and IKZF3 transcription factors in K562 and MOLT-4 leukemia cells. ATP-binding cassette protein 50 (ABC50) was identified as a target for dicarboximides. Cancer cells with knocked down ABC50 showed increased resistance to dicarboximides. Based on the structure of dicarboximides and thalidomide, novel proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) were synthesized and used as tools to downregulate ABC50 in leukemia cells.","['Cieslak, Marcin', 'Kazmierczak-Baranska, Julia', 'Krolewska-Golinska, Karolina', 'Napiorkowska, Mariola', 'Stukan, Iga', 'Wojda, Urszula', 'Nawrot, Barbara']","['Cieslak M', 'Kazmierczak-Baranska J', 'Krolewska-Golinska K', 'Napiorkowska M', 'Stukan I', 'Wojda U', 'Nawrot B']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9628-214X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1174-2208', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4084-4334']","['Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland. marcin@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Medical University of Warsaw, 3 Oczki Str., 02-007 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Testing of Higher Standard, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of Polish Academy of Sciences, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Testing of Higher Standard, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of Polish Academy of Sciences, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,PMC6770581,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABC50 (ABCf1)', '*anticancer compounds', '*apoptosis', '*cytotoxicity', '*dicarboximides', '*leukemia', '*protac (proteolysis targeting chimera)']",2019/09/07 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['biom9090446 [pii]', '10.3390/biom9090446 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2019 Sep 4;9(9). pii: biom9090446. doi: 10.3390/biom9090446.,20200727,,,"['0 (ABCF1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thalidomide/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a study to elucidate the role of CD204(+) macrophages in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allogeneic HCT). METHODS: In a total of 81 patients who received allogeneic HCT for non-remission malignant lymphoma, immunohistochemical staining of CD204 using specimens preserved before allogeneic HCT was performed. According to the average number of CD204(+) macrophages in a high-power field, patients were categorized into three groups: low (<25th percentile), intermediate (>/=25th percentile and <50th percentile), and high (>/=50th percentile). RESULTS: The B-cell lymphoma proportion was higher in the low group, while T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia proportions were higher in the high group. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was poorest in the high group; low vs intermediate vs high = 83.3% vs 43.7% vs 20.2% (P < .01). The 3-year cumulative incidences of relapse were significantly higher in the high group than the intermediate and low groups: 67.0% vs 38.1% vs 18.2% (P < .01). In multivariate analyses, the numbers of CD204(+) macrophages were independent risk factors of poorer OS and cumulative incidences of relapse.

The diagnostic criteria for NK/T-cell lymphoma are highlighted, followed by an update of the diagnostic and prognostic importance (on presentation, at interim and end-of-treatment) of plasma EBV DNA as a surrogate biomarker of lymphoma load. Prognostic models based on clinicopathologic features and EBV DNA load are discussed. For stage I/II NK/T-cell lymphomas, combined chemotherapy, and radiotherapy gives the best results, with their concomitant or sequential administration equally efficacious. For stage III/IV NK/T-cell lymphoma, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Conventional anthracycline-based regimens for B-cell lymphomas are ineffective. Recommended regimens combine L-asparaginase with other drugs not affected by P-glycoprotein. For relapsed/refractory patients, immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 has shown much promise.Expert opinion: Current strategies result in durable remissions in a significant proportion of NK/T-cell lymphomas.

Moreover, dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways that normally regulate cellular transcription, growth, translation, and proliferation is frequently encountered in this malignancy. ALL is the most frequent tumor in childhood, and adult ALL patients still correlate with poor survival. This review focuses on modern therapies in ALL that move beyond standard chemotherapy, with a particular emphasis on immunotherapeutic approaches as new treatment strategies. Bi-specific T-cell Engagers (BiTE) antibodies, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, or CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]-associated nuclease 9) represent other new innovative approaches for this disease. Target and tailored therapy could make the difference in previously untreatable cases, i.e., precision and personalized medicine. Clinical trials will help to select the most efficient novel therapies in ALL management and to integrate them with existing treatments to achieve durable cures.","['Simioni, Carolina', 'Bergamini, Fabio', 'Ferioli, Martina', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'Caruso, Lorenzo', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Simioni C', 'Bergamini F', 'Ferioli M', 'Rimondi E', 'Caruso L', 'Neri LM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0801-7811'],"['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA-Electron Microscopy Center, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA-Electron Microscopy Center, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Fondo di Ateneo per la Ricerca Scientifica (FAR)', ""Fondo per l'Incentivazione alla Ricerca (FIR)"", 'Lega Italiana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (LILT) - Sezione Provinciale di', 'Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy', 'Associazione Onconauti, Bologna, Italy']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191021,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,['NOTNLM'],"['BiTE antibodies', 'CAR-T', 'CRISPR-Cas9', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'targeted therapy']",2019/09/06 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2678 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;38(1):22-33. doi: 10.1002/hon.2678.

Because of the complexity of the current minimal residual disease (MRD) detecting-methods, the DNA methylation status of the RASSF6 and RASSF10 genes could potentially become biomarkers for the assessment of MRD levels in ALL patients. The promoter methylation status of RASSF6 and RASSF10 was assessed by using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in the DNA isolated from 280 peripheral blood (PB) samples taken at the time of diagnosis, day 14, 28, and from the subsequent 30-month follow-ups of 45 adult ALL patients. The relative methylation level obtained during the follow-ups by MSP was compared to the MRD results obtained by the amplification of IG/TCR clonal rearrangements using the allele-specific quantitative-PCR (ASO-PCR) assay. Frequently, RASSF6 was methylated in B-ALL, and RASSF10 was methylated in T-ALL. The applicability and accuracy of the assays were increased when these markers were combined (91.1% and 93.8%, respectively). When a cutoff was defined for the PCR-MRD level, results of the 30 months of MRD detection showed a significant correlation between the PCR and MSP techniques (r = 0.848; p < 0.001). Due to the high applicability, the non-invasiveness, and promising prospect of longitudinal assessment, the DNA methylation status of the RASSF6 and RASSF10 genes could be potential biomarkers for the assessment of residual disease in PB of patients with ALL.","['Younesian, Samareh', 'Shahkarami, Sepideh', 'Ghaffari, Parisa', 'Alizadeh, Shaban', 'Mehrasa, Roya', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Younesian S', 'Shahkarami S', 'Ghaffari P', 'Alizadeh S', 'Mehrasa R', 'Ghaffari SH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8633-9077'],"['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, International Campus, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Research Center for Immunodeficiencies, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."", 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari200@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['95-01-36-31971/Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research', 'Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190905,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'DNA hypermethylation', 'Minimal residual disease', 'RASSF10', 'RASSF6', 'Tumor suppressor gene']",2019/09/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03775-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03775-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Dec;98(12):2719-2727. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03775-y.

Animatronic devices are a promising means of distraction intervention. This study aimed to assess acceptability and feasibility of the My Special Aflac Duck(R) (MSAD) intervention among pediatric oncology patients and parents. We hypothesized that MSAD would be feasible to implement, have greater than 50% acceptance, and be useful distraction. PROCEDURES: This feasibility study enrolled oncology patients aged 3-11 years admitted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta between May and August 2018. Patients were exposed to MSAD for 3 days and completed quantitative and qualitative assessments of acceptability. Patient and hospital data were abstracted. RESULTS: Seventeen (80.9%) of 21 eligible patients enrolled; 64.7% were <7 years, 47% were female, 52.9% had leukemia, 41.2% had solid tumors, and 5.9% had brain tumors. Patients had 1-12 previous admissions (mean 4.8, SD 3.1) and approximately 65% were planned hospitalizations. Approximately 69% reported MSAD helped reduce in-patient distress and 93.7% were satisfied with MSAD overall. Child satisfaction was high. There were no significant differences in acceptability or satisfaction with MSAD based on age, gender, number of inpatient procedures or previous hospitalizations, or hospitalization reason. Qualitative interviews revealed patients liked expressing feelings with tokens and thought MSAD was a fun distraction. CONCLUSIONS: MSAD implementation was feasible, and its acceptability was high among both patients and parents. MSAD shows potential as good distraction and an alternative means of communicating feelings. Future research should expand upon the effectiveness of MSAD on reducing distress.","['Miller, Tamara P', 'Klosky, James L', 'Zamora, Fernanda', 'Swift, Megan', 'Mertens, Ann C']","['Miller TP', 'Klosky JL', 'Zamora F', 'Swift M', 'Mertens AC']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4250-5376', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0989-0962']","[""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['K07 CA211956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190905,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC6938026,['NOTNLM'],"['*intervention', '*pediatric oncology', '*psychosocial', '*support care']",2019/09/06 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27984 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Dec;66(12):e27984. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27984.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of microRNA-577 in peripheral blood of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Meanwhile, the expression of microRNA-577 was detected in CML cell line after imatinib treatment. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assay were applied to verify the effect of microRNA-577 on cell proliferation and cycle. NUP160 was identified as a target gene of microRNA-577 by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell reverse test was performed to figure out whether microRNA-577 can enhance the sensitivity of CML to imatinib. RESULTS: QRT-PCR results revealed that microRNA-577 level was notably decreased in peripheral blood of patients with CML, and microRNA-577 could inhibit the proliferation and cycle of CML cells. In addition, the result of dual-luciferase reporting assay indicated that microRNA-577 had a binding relationship with NUP160, and up-regulation of microRNA-577 in CML cell lines reduced the expression of NUP160, and vice versa. Lastly, cell reverse experiments confirmed that microRNA-577 can alleviate the resistance of CML to imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: We found that microRNA-577 promotes the sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib by down-regulating the expression of NUP160.","['Zhang, X-T', 'Dong, S-H', 'Zhang, J-Y', 'Shan, B']","['Zhang XT', 'Dong SH', 'Zhang JY', 'Shan B']",,"['Department of Pediatric Clinic, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China. qdbaihexuan@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,,,,2019/09/06 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201908_18741 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Aug;23(16):7008-7015. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201908_18741.,20201207,7008-7015,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN577 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NUP160 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

More rarely the diagnosis is directed towards an eosinophilic pathology or an acute leukemia. In other cases, CMML, MPN or MDS with monocytosis may be highlighted.

Although histological, immunohistochemical and phenotypic flow cytometric studies are not currently recommended by WHO, these investigations could be of interest in the evaluation of difficult cases.","['Labrousse, Julien', 'Pasini, Sophie', 'Vignon, Guillaume', 'Bonnin, Anthony', 'Mottaz, Philippe', 'Carrere, Francois', 'Augereau, Pierre-Frederic', 'Aucher, Philippe', 'Lellouche, Franck']","['Labrousse J', 'Pasini S', 'Vignon G', 'Bonnin A', 'Mottaz P', 'Carrere F', 'Augereau PF', 'Aucher P', 'Lellouche F']",,"[""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France."", ""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France."", ""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France."", 'Service de medecine interne, Centre Hospitalier de Royan, Vaux-sur-Mer, France.', 'Service de medecine interne, Centre Hospitalier de Royan, Vaux-sur-Mer, France.', ""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France."", ""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France."", ""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France."", ""Groupement de cooperation sanitaire de Saintonge, Laboratoire inter-hospitalier de biologie medicale (Centres Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, Saintes, Royan et Jonzac), Saint-Jean-d'Angely, France, Service de medecine interne, Centre Hospitalier de Royan, Vaux-sur-Mer, France.""]",['fre'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*monocytes', '*monocytosis', '*myeloproliferative neoplasms']",2019/09/06 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['abc.2019.1475 [pii]', '10.1684/abc.2019.1475 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2019 Oct 1;77(5):485-494. doi: 10.1684/abc.2019.1475.,20200331,485-494,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology']",,,,,,Conduite a tenir devant une monocytose de l'adulte.,,,,,,

Recent studies also demonstrated the potential role of DOK6 in solid tumors such as gastric cancer and breast cancer. However, previous studies of DOK6 have not dealt with its roles in myeloid malignancies. Herein, we verified the promoter methylation status of DOK6 and further explored its clinical implication in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: A total of 100 newly diagnosed adult AML patients were involved in the current study. DOK6 expression and methylation were detected by real-time qPCR and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was performed to assess the methylation density of the DOK6 promoter. RESULTS: Downstream of tyrosine kinase 6 promoter methylation was significantly increased in AML patients compared to controls (P = .037), whereas DOK6 expression significantly decreased in AML patients (P < .001). The expression of DOK6 was markedly up-regulated after treated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) in THP-1 cell lines. The methylation status of the DOK6 promoter was associated with French-American-British classifications (P = .037). There was no significant correlation existed between DOK6 expression and its promoter methylation (R = .077, P = .635). Interestingly, of whole-AML and non-APL AML patients, both have a tendency pertaining to the DOK6 methylation group and a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than the DOK6 unmethylation group (P = .042 and .036, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that DOK6 promoter hypermethylation was a common molecular event in de novo AML patients. Remarkably, DOK6 promoter methylation could serve as an independent and integrated prognostic biomarker not only in non-APL AML patients but also in AML patients who are less than 60 years old.","['Sun, Guo-Kang', 'Tang, Li-Juan', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Yang, Lan', 'Yuan, Qian', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Liu, Xing-Hui', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun', 'Yao, Dong-Ming']","['Sun GK', 'Tang LJ', 'Zhou JD', 'Xu ZJ', 'Yang L', 'Yuan Q', 'Ma JC', 'Liu XH', 'Lin J', 'Qian J', 'Yao DM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8253-8768', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1476-926X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4704-9157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2649-8121']","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Gongli Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['81270630/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'BRA2016131/333 Project of Jiangsu Province/International', 'CXTDB2017002/Medical Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province/International', 'SS2018009/Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology/International', '2015-WSN-115/Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province/International', 'SH2018044/Social Development Foundation of Zhenjiang/International', 'Key Medical Talent Program of Zhenjiang City/International', 'KYCX17_1821/Postgraduate Research &amp; Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu', 'Province/International', 'PWZxq2017-15/The Key Disciplines Group Construction Project of Pudong Health', 'Bureau of Shanghai/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6797566,['NOTNLM'],"['* DOK6', '*AML', '*biomarker', '*methylation', '*prognosis']",2019/09/06 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2540 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Oct;8(14):6393-6402. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2540.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether HOTAIR could serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM), and to investigate its role in regards to MM cell viability and chemoresistance to dexamethasone (DEX). The results revealed that the expression of HOTAIR was significantly upregulated in serum, bone marrow and primary CD138+ cells from MM patients compared with those from normal controls as determined by qPCR. HOTAIR expression was obviously increased in MM cell lines compared to that in normal plasma cells. ROC curve analysis showed that the serum level of HOTAIR exhibited a higher diagnostic value for MM. Furthermore, lossoffunctional assays indicated that HOTAIR inhibition suppressed MM cell viability by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase as determined by cell viability assay and flow cytometry. An indepth study revealed that knockdown of HOTAIR led to decreased chemoresistance of DEX in MM cells by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that upregulation of serum HOTAIR may prove to be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of MM. HOTAIR promoted MM cell viability and increased chemoresistance of MM to DEX via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, indicating HOTAIR may also serve as a potential therapeutic target for MM.","['Guan, Rongyan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Fu, Bin', 'Pang, Yujun', 'Lou, Ye', 'Li, Hong']","['Guan R', 'Wang W', 'Fu B', 'Pang Y', 'Lou Y', 'Li H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Daqing Oilfield General Hospital, Daqing, Heilongjiang 163001, P.R.

Bioactive nutrients, including resveratrol (RSV) and alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been indicated to regulate epigenetic machinery in malignant cells. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether the tested phytochemicals, RSV or ATRA, can improve the therapeutic epigenetic effects of CIF in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. The present study investigates, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the influence of CIF in combination with RSV or ATRA on the expression of relevant modifiers of DNA methylation machinery, including DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) in CML cells. Subsequently, the combinatorial effects on promoter methylation and transcript levels of methylationsilenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB), were estimated using MSRA and qPCR, respectively. The tested TSGs were chosen according to bioinformatical analysis of publicly available clinical data of human DNA methylation and gene expression arrays in leukemia patients. The K562 cell line was used as an experimental CML in vitro model. Following a period of 72 h exposure of K562 cells, the tested combinations led to significant cell growth inhibition and induction of caspase3dependent apoptosis. These observations were accompanied by DNMT1 downregulation and CDKN1A upregulation, with a concomitant enhanced decrease in DNMT1 protein level, especially after ATRA treatment with CIF. Concurrent methylationmediated RARB and PTEN reactivation was detected. The results of the current study demonstrated that CIF that was used in combination with the tested phytochemicals, RSV or ATRA, exhibited a greater ability to remodel DNA methylation marks and promote cell death in CML cells. These results may support the application of CIF combinations with natural bioactive agents in antileukemic epigenetic therapy.","['Kaufman-Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Majda, Katarzyna', 'Szulawska-Mroczek, Agata', 'Fabianowska-Majewska, Krystyna', 'Lubecka, Katarzyna']","['Kaufman-Szymczyk A', 'Majda K', 'Szulawska-Mroczek A', 'Fabianowska-Majewska K', 'Lubecka K']",,"['Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lodz, 92215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lodz, 92215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lodz, 92215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Lazarski University, 02662 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lodz, 92215 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190827,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,PMC6755200,,,2019/09/06 06:00,2020/02/08 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/mmr.2019.10619 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2019 Oct;20(4):3597-3608. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2019.10619.

The present study explored the association between the autophagic activity and chemotherapy resistance of leukaemia cells, and the possibility of using autophagy inhibitors to combat leukemic drug resistance. It was found that the levels of basic autophagy in multidrugresistant leukaemia cells (K562/ADM) were significantly higher compared with sensitive cells (K562), and that Adriamycin (ADM) was capable of inducing autophagic activity in K562 and K562/ADM cells. K562 and K562/ADM cells were treated with a series of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) concentrations to inhibit cellular autophagy and detect cell sensitivity to ADM. The results demonstrated that the sensitivity of K562 cells to ADM was mildly enhanced by HCQ, and that the sensitivity of K562/ADM cells to ADM was markedly strengthened by HCQ. In addition, more typical morphological changes associated with apoptosis emerged, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl2 and activity of caspase3 were markedly increased in K562/ADM cells treated with HCQ. Notably, the expression of mdr1 mRNA and Pglycoprotein (Pgp) in drugresistant K562/ADM cells was upregulated along with increasing autophagic activity induced by ADM. Furthermore, HCQ significantly reduced the increase in Pgp expression by inhibiting autophagic activity. Collectively, these findings indicated that the inhibition of autophagy significantly promoted the sensitivity of K562/ADM cells to ADM by facilitating apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy attenuated the expression of Pgp; therefore, Pgp may be involved in autophagic regulation in drugresistant cells.","['Wang, Feifei', 'Zhang, Zhewen', 'Leung, Wing Ting', 'Chen, Jing', 'Yi, Juan', 'Ying, Chunmei', 'Yuan, Minmin', 'Wang, Mingyan', 'Zhang, Na', 'Qiu, Xuemin', 'Wang, Ling', 'Wei, Hulai']","['Wang F', 'Zhang Z', 'Leung WT', 'Chen J', 'Yi J', 'Ying C', 'Yuan M', 'Wang M', 'Zhang N', 'Qiu X', 'Wang L', 'Wei H']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200011, P.R.

Method: In a non-randomized trial, controls (the first three rotations) received a standard set of lectures, and the intervention arm received these lectures plus five simulation-training scenarios-fever/neutropenia, a new leukemia diagnosis, end-of-life care discussion, tumor lysis syndrome, and a mediastinal mass. All residents were tested after the rotation on the first three scenarios; management skills were evaluated independently by two raters. Before and after training, all residents completed an emotional-appraisal questionnaire evaluating each scenario as a perceived challenge or threat. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) measured differences by study arm in skills-checklist assessments and appraisals; repeated-measures ANOVA measured changes in emotional-appraisal scores. Results: Forty-two residents (9 control, 33 intervention) participated. Inter-rater agreement for skills-checklist scores using average-measures intraclass correlation was high (0.847), and overall mean scores were significantly higher for the intervention than control group across both raters (P = 0.005). For all residents, perceived challenge increased in the end-of-life simulation, and perceived threat decreased in all three test scenarios. The intervention group, regardless of training year, evaluated the teaching scenarios favorably and felt that challenging oncology situations were addressed, skills were enhanced, and the simulations should be offered to other residents. Conclusions: It was feasible to introduce residents to difficult pediatric oncology scenarios using simulation. The intervention group performed more skills than controls when tested, and perceive threat declined in all residents after their pediatric oncology rotation.","['Smink, Gayle M', 'Jeffe, Donna B', 'Hayashi, Robert J', 'Al-Hammadi, Noor', 'Fehr, James J']","['Smink GM', 'Jeffe DB', 'Hayashi RJ', 'Al-Hammadi N', 'Fehr JJ']",,"['Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Penn State Milton S.

Here we evaluated the effects of aging on B cell subsets in peripheral blood of 155 immunologically healthy individuals in four age categories (range 20-95y) via multi-parameter flow cytometry. Furthermore, we studied the naive and antigen-experienced B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire of different age groups and compared it to the clonal BCR repertoire of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease typically presenting in elderly individuals. Results: Total numbers and relative frequencies of B cells were found to decline upon aging, with reductions in transitional B cells, memory cell types, and plasma blasts in the 70 + y group. The BCR repertoire of naive mature B cells and antigen-experienced B cells did not clearly alter until age 70y. Clear changes in IGHV gene usage were observed in naive mature B cells of 70 + y individuals, with a transitional pattern in the 50-70y group. IGHV gene usage of naive mature B cells of the 50-70y, but not the 70 + y, age group resembled that of both younger (50-70y) and older (70 + y) CLL patients. Additionally, CLL-associated stereotypic BCR were found as part of the healthy control BCR repertoire, with an age-associated increase in frequency of several stereotypic BCR (particularly subsets #2 and #5). Conclusion: Composition of the peripheral B cell compartment changes with ageing, with clear reductions in non-switched and CD27 + IgG+ switched memory B cells and plasma blasts in especially the 70 + y group. The BCR repertoire is relatively stable until 70y, whereafter differences in IGHV gene usage are seen. Upon ageing, an increasing trend in the occurrence of particular CLL-associated stereotypic BCR is observed.","['Muggen, Alice F', 'de Jong, Madelon', 'Wolvers-Tettero, Ingrid L M', 'Kallemeijn, Martine J', 'Teodosio, Cristina', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Stadhouders, Ralph', 'IJspeert, Hanna', 'van der Burg, Mirjam', 'van IJcken, Wilfred Fj', 'Verhaar, Jan A N', 'Abdulahad, Wayel H', 'Brouwer, Elisabeth', 'Boots, Annemieke M H', 'Hendriks, Rudi W', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['Muggen AF', 'de Jong M', 'Wolvers-Tettero ILM', 'Kallemeijn MJ', 'Teodosio C', 'Darzentas N', 'Stadhouders R', 'IJspeert H', 'van der Burg M', 'van IJcken WF', 'Verhaar JAN', 'Abdulahad WH', 'Brouwer E', 'Boots AMH', 'Hendriks RW', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Langerak AW']",,"['1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '2Present Address: Department Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.0000000089452978grid.10419.3d', '3Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.grid.497421.d', '4Department Internal Medicine, University Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.0000 0004 0646 2097grid.412468.d', '5Department Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '6Present Address: Department Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.0000000089452978grid.10419.3d', '7Biomics Core Facility, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '8Department Orthopedics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '9Department Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.0000 0000 9558 4598grid.4494.d', '9Department Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.0000 0000 9558 4598grid.4494.d', '9Department Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.0000 0000 9558 4598grid.4494.d', '5Department Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2', '2Present Address: Department Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.0000000089452978grid.10419.3d', '1Department Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.000000040459992Xgrid.5645.2']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190828,England,Immun Ageing,Immunity & ageing : I & A,101235427,PMC6714092,['NOTNLM'],"['Aging', 'B-lymphocyte', 'BCR repertoire', 'CLL', 'Stereotypic BCR']",2019/09/06 06:00,2019/09/06 06:01,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12979-019-0163-x [doi]', '163 [pii]']",epublish,Immun Ageing. 2019 Aug 28;16:22. doi: 10.1186/s12979-019-0163-x. eCollection 2019.,,22,,,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that dismal clinical outcomes may be improved by a better definition of the tight interaction between the AML cell population and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (""the niche""); the latter has been progressively highlighted to have an active role in the disease process. It has now been well established that the leukemic population may misinterpret niche-derived signals and remodel the niche, providing a shelter to AML cells and protecting them from the cytotoxic effects of chemoradiotherapy. Novel imaging technological advances and preclinical disease models have revealed that, due to the finite number of BM niches, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) compete for the same functional areas. Thus, the removal of LSCs from the BM niche and the promotion of normal HSC engraftment should be the primary goals in antileukemic research. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly clear that AML-niche dynamics are disease stage specific. In AML, the niche has been linked to disease pathogenesis in the preleukemic stage, the niche becomes permissive once leukemic cells are established, and the niche is transformed into a self-reinforcing structure at a later disease stage. These concepts have been fostered by the demonstration that, in unrelated AML types, endosteal vessel loss occurs as a primary AML-induced niche alteration, and additional AML-induced alterations of the niche and normal hematopoiesis evolve focally and in parallel. Obviously, this endosteal vessel loss plays a fundamental role in AML pathogenesis by causing excessive vascular permeability, hypoxia, altered perfusion, and reduced drug delivery. Each of these alterations may be effectively targeted by various therapeutic procedures, but preservation of endosteal vessel integrity might be the best option for any future antileukemic treatment.","['Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Borsani, Oscar']","['Bernasconi P', 'Borsani O']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7805-7806'],"['University of Pavia, Department of Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'University of Pavia, Department of Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190807,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,PMC6702816,,,2019/09/06 06:00,2019/09/06 06:01,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/8323592 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 Aug 7;2019:8323592. doi: 10.1155/2019/8323592. eCollection 2019.,,8323592,,,,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The C-terminal catalytic SET (Su(var.)3-9, enhancer of zeste and trithorax) domains of MLL proteins are associated with a common set of regulatory factors (WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L and DPY30) to achieve specific activities(7-9). Current knowledge of the regulation of MLL activity is limited to the catalysis of histone H3 peptides, and how H3K4 methyl marks are deposited on nucleosomes is poorly understood. H3K4 methylation is stimulated by mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2BK120ub1), a prevalent histone H2B mark that disrupts chromatin compaction and favours open chromatin structures, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown(10-12). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MLL1 and MLL3 catalytic modules associated with nucleosome core particles that contain H2BK120ub1 or unmodified H2BK120. These structures demonstrate that the MLL1 and MLL3 complexes both make extensive contacts with the histone-fold and DNA regions of the nucleosome; this allows ease of access to the histone H3 tail, which is essential for the efficient methylation of H3K4. The H2B-conjugated ubiquitin binds directly to RBBP5, orienting the association between MLL1 or MLL3 and the nucleosome. The MLL1 and MLL3 complexes display different structural organizations at the interface between the WDR5, RBBP5 and MLL1 (or the corresponding MLL3) subunits, which accounts for the opposite roles of WDR5 in regulating the activity of the two enzymes. These findings transform our understanding of the structural basis for the regulation of MLL activity at the nucleosome level, and highlight the pivotal role of nucleosome regulation in histone-tail modification.","['Xue, Han', 'Yao, Tonghui', 'Cao, Mi', 'Zhu, Guanjun', 'Li, Yan', 'Yuan, Guiyong', 'Chen, Yong', 'Lei, Ming', 'Huang, Jing']","['Xue H', 'Yao T', 'Cao M', 'Zhu G', 'Li Y', 'Yuan G', 'Chen Y', 'Lei M', 'Huang J']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', ""Shanghai Institute of Precision Medicine, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'National Facility for Protein Sciences in Shanghai, ZhangJiang Laboratory, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', ""Shanghai Institute of Precision Medicine, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', ""Shanghai Institute of Precision Medicine, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Institute of Precision Medicine, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. huangjing@shsmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,,,2019/09/06 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41586-019-1528-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41586-019-1528-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2019 Sep;573(7774):445-449. doi: 10.1038/s41586-019-1528-1.

Here, we find that the oncofetal HMGA2 gene is aberrantly reexpressed in many tumor types together with its antisense transcribed pseudogene RPSAP52. RPSAP52 is abundantly present in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with the RNA binding protein IGF2BP2/IMP2, facilitating its binding to mRNA targets, promoting their translation by mediating their recruitment on polysomes and enhancing proliferative and self-renewal pathways. Notably, downregulation of RPSAP52 impairs the balance between the oncogene LIN28B and the tumor suppressor let-7 family of miRNAs, inhibits cellular proliferation and migration in vitro and slows down tumor growth in vivo. In addition, high levels of RPSAP52 in patient samples associate with a worse prognosis in sarcomas. Overall, we reveal the roles of a transcribed pseudogene that may display properties of an oncofetal master regulator in human cancers.","['Oliveira-Mateos, Cristina', 'Sanchez-Castillo, Anais',

Patients with aggressive ATL exhibit poor outcomes, even with dose-dense intensive chemotherapy. Thus, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is considered in all patients eligible for transplant. However, patients with aggressive ATL often have chemo-refractoriness or experience early relapse during chemotherapy. Allo-HSCT is often ineffective in patients with active disease status. Mogamulizumab (Moga) was approved in 2012 in Japan as a potent treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory ATL. However, there is a major concern that the use of Moga before allo-HSCT could increase the risk of post-transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), because Moga depletes regulatory T cells. Here, we would like to describe the possible effects of pre-transplant Moga on post-transplant complications, such as acute GVHD, and to discuss how Moga could be efficiently incorporated in the treatment regimen of patients with aggressive ATL to maximize the expected clinical benefit.","['Fuji, Shigeo']",['Fuji S'],,"['Department of Hematology, Osaka International Cancer Institute.']",['jpn'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Mogamulizumab', 'Regulatory T cell']",2019/09/06 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.60.968 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2019;60(8):968-972. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.60.968.,20190910,968-972,,"['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A matched brain-dead lung donor was found after 5 months of intensive care management on ECMO, and bilateral lung transplantation was successfully performed. BO is a progressive refractory respiratory disease with poor prognosis. Careful management of infection, monitoring organ function, and lung transplantation at the appropriate time of initiation of mechanical ventilation or ECMO may save a patient's life.

Here, we describe mechanisms of adaptive resistance in FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase (FLT3)-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by examining integrative in-cell kinase and gene regulatory network responses after oncogenic signaling blockade by FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i). We identified activation of innate immune stress response pathways after treatment of FLT3-mutant AML cells with FLT3i and showed that innate immune pathway activation via the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and 4 (IRAK1/4) complex contributes to adaptive resistance in FLT3-mutant AML cells. To overcome this adaptive resistance mechanism, we developed a small molecule that simultaneously inhibits FLT3 and IRAK1/4 kinases. The multikinase FLT3-IRAK1/4 inhibitor eliminated adaptively resistant FLT3-mutant AML cells in vitro and in vivo and displayed superior efficacy as compared to current targeted FLT3 therapies. These findings uncover a polypharmacologic strategy for overcoming adaptive resistance to therapy in AML by targeting immune stress response pathways.","['Melgar, Katelyn', 'Walker, Morgan M', 'Jones,

We analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of DDX41-related myeloid malignancies in an unselected cohort of 1385 patients with MDS or AML. Using targeted next-generation sequencing, we identified 28 different germline DDX41 variants in 43 unrelated patients, which we classified as causal (n = 21) or unknown significance (n = 7) variants. We focused on the 33 patients having causal variants, representing 2.4% of our cohort. The median age was 69 years; most patients were men (79%). Only 9 patients (27%) had a family history of hematological malignancy, and 15 (46%) had a personal history of cytopenia years before MDS/AML diagnosis. Most patients had a normal karyotype (85%), and the most frequent somatic alteration was a second DDX41 mutation (79%). High-risk DDX41 MDS/AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (n = 9) or azacitidine (n = 11) had an overall response rate of 100% or 73%, respectively, with a median overall survival of 5.2 years. Our study highlights that germline DDX41 mutations are relatively common in adult MDS/AML, often without known family history, arguing for systematic screening. Salient features of DDX41-related myeloid malignancies include male preponderance, frequent preexisting cytopenia, additional somatic DDX41 mutation, and relatively good outcome.","['Sebert, Marie', 'Passet, Marie', 'Raimbault, Anna', 'Rahme, Ramy', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Sicre de Fontbrune, Flore', 'Cerrano, Marco', 'Quentin, Samuel', 'Vasquez, Nadia', 'Da Costa, Melanie', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Peffault de Latour, Regis', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle']","['Sebert M', 'Passet M', 'Raimbault A', 'Rahme R', 'Raffoux E', 'Sicre de Fontbrune F', 'Cerrano M', 'Quentin S', 'Vasquez N', 'Da Costa M', 'Boissel N', 'Dombret H', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Socie G', 'Itzykson R', 'Fenaux P', 'Soulier J', 'Ades L', 'Clappier E']",,"['Hematologie Senior, Saint Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematology Laboratory.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematology Laboratory.', 'Hematologie Senior, Saint Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematologie adulte, and.', 'Hematology/Transplantation, Saint Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie adulte, and.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory.', 'Hematology Laboratory.', 'Hematology Laboratory.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematologie adulte, and.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematologie adulte, and.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematology/Transplantation, Saint Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematology/Transplantation, Saint Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematologie adulte, and.', 'Hematologie Senior, Saint Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematology Laboratory.', 'Hematologie Senior, Saint Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, INSERM U944/CNRS Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7212, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Paris-Diderot, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; and.', 'Hematology Laboratory.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2019/09/06 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)74028-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000909 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Oct 24;134(17):1441-1444. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000909.,20200217,1441-1444,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['EC 3.6.1.- (DDX41 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",,,,['Blood. 2019 Oct 24;134(17):1368-1370.

Recently, there has been discussion regarding the combination of tiopronin in anticancer therapy to overcome acquired resistance to anticancer drugs. However, thiols are also known to act as antioxidants, which can be contraindicated in cancer chemotherapy. This article focuses on the inhibitory effects of tiopronin and MSA on bovine and human glutathione peroxidase activities, and their effects on the redox status of cancer cells. IC50 values for the inhibition for the bovine erythrocyte enzyme were 356 and 24.7 muM for tiopronin and MSA, respectively, with the corresponding Ki values of 343 muM and 14.6 muM, respectively at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C. MSA inhibited human GPx activity in human cancer cell lysates at its IC50 while tiopronin did not. Both compounds were cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines GUMBUS and HL-60, with IC50 values between 42.7 and 149.4 muM. Neither had an effect on cell cycle. Only MSA induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells but not in GUMBUS cells, while tiopronin resulted in no apoptosis in either cell line. Combination studies of the MSA with hydrogen peroxide in living cells enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species in GUMBUS cells while tiopronin acted as antioxidant in HL-60 cells. MSA and tiopronin antagonized the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate in combination studies. Our findings indicate that the antioxidant properties of both thiols prevail over their GPx inhibitory activity in human cancer cell lines.","['Behnisch-Cornwell, S', 'Laubenstein, G', 'Bednarski, P J']","['Behnisch-Cornwell S', 'Laubenstein G', 'Bednarski PJ']",,,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,,,,2019/09/06 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1691/ph.2019.9472 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmazie. 2019 Sep 1;74(9):536-542. doi: 10.1691/ph.2019.9472.,20200714,536-542,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiomalates)', '94239W5L4H (2-thiomalic acid)', 'C5W04GO61S (Tiopronin)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thiomalates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tiopronin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Permanently active KIT mutations lead these host cells to tumorigenesis, and to such diseases as mast cell leukemia (MCL), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, we reported that in MCL, KIT with mutations (D816V, human; D814Y, mouse) traffics to endolysosomes (EL), where it can then initiate oncogenic signaling. On the other hand, KIT mutants including KIT(D814Y) in GIST accumulate on the Golgi, and from there, activate downstream. KIT mutations, such as N822K, have been found in 30% of core binding factor-AML (CBF-AML) patients. However, how the mutants are tyrosine-phosphorylated and where they activate downstream molecules remain unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether a KIT mutant other than KIT(D816V) in MCL is able to signal on EL. METHODS: We used leukemia cell lines, such as Kasumi-1 (KIT(N822K), AML), SKNO-1 (KIT(N822K), AML), and HMC-1.1 (KIT(V560G), MCL), to explore how KIT transduces signals in these cells and to examine the signal platform for the mutants using immunofluorescence microscopy and inhibition of intracellular trafficking. RESULTS: In AML cell lines, KIT(N822K) aberrantly localizes to EL. After biosynthesis, KIT traffics to the cell surface via the Golgi and immediately migrates to EL through endocytosis in a manner dependent on its kinase activity. However, results of phosphorylation imaging show that KIT is preferentially activated on the Golgi. Indeed, blockade of KIT(N822K) migration to the Golgi with BFA/M-COPA inhibits the activation of KIT downstream molecules, such as AKT, ERK, and STAT5, indicating that KIT signaling occurs on the Golgi. Moreover, lipid rafts in the Golgi play a role in KIT signaling. Interestingly, KIT(V560G) in HMC-1.1 migrates and activates downstream in a similar manner to KIT(N822K) in Kasumi-1. CONCLUSIONS: In AML, KIT(N822K) mislocalizes to EL. Our findings, however, suggest that the mutant transduces phosphorylation signals on lipid rafts of the Golgi in leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, the KIT(V560G) signal platform in MCL is similar to that of KIT(N822K) in AML. These observations provide new insights into the pathogenic role of KIT mutants as well as that of other mutant molecules.","['Obata, Yuuki', 'Hara, Yasushi', 'Shiina, Isamu', 'Murata, Takatsugu', 'Tasaki, Yasutaka', 'Suzuki, Kyohei', 'Ito, Keiichi', 'Tsugawa, Shou', 'Yamawaki, Kouhei', 'Takahashi, Tsuyoshi', 'Okamoto, Koji', 'Nishida, Toshirou', 'Abe, Ryo']","['Obata Y', 'Hara Y', 'Shiina I', 'Murata T', 'Tasaki Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Ito K', 'Tsugawa S', 'Yamawaki K', 'Takahashi T', 'Okamoto K', 'Nishida T', 'Abe R']",,"['Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Yamazaki 2669, Noda, Chiba, 278-0022, Japan. yuobata@ncc.go.jp.', 'Division of Cancer Differentiation, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji 5-1-1, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Tokyo, Japan. yuobata@ncc.go.jp.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Yamazaki 2669, Noda, Chiba, 278-0022, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Kagurazaka 1-3, Shinjuku-ku, 162-8601, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Kagurazaka 1-3, Shinjuku-ku, 162-8601, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Kagurazaka 1-3, Shinjuku-ku, 162-8601, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Kagurazaka 1-3, Shinjuku-ku, 162-8601, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Kagurazaka 1-3, Shinjuku-ku, 162-8601, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Differentiation, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji 5-1-1, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Kagurazaka 1-3, Shinjuku-ku, 162-8601, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Differentiation, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji 5-1-1, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Osaka University, Graduate School of Medicine, Yamadaoka 2-2, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Differentiation, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji 5-1-1, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tsukiji 5-1-1, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Yamazaki 2669, Noda, Chiba, 278-0022, Japan. rabe@rs.noda.tus.ac.jp.', 'SIRC, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku 2-11-1, Itabashi-ku, 173-8605, Tokyo, Japan. rabe@rs.noda.tus.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,PMC6727407,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT', '*ERK', '*Endocytosis', '*Golgi', '*KIT tyrosine kinase', '*Leukemia', '*Lipid rafts', '*STAT5']",2019/09/06 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-019-0426-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12964-019-0426-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2019 Sep 4;17(1):114. doi: 10.1186/s12964-019-0426-3.,20200713,114,,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL cells affect the phenotype and function of the entire spectrum of innate and adaptive immune cells, including monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, leading to a tumor-supportive environment and reduced immunosurveillance. Novel immunotherapies like immune checkpoint blockade, bi- and tri-specific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells use the patients' immune system to induce therapeutic responses. Although these novel immunotherapies showed impressive results in several B cell lymphomas, responses in CLL were often disappointing. The strong immunomodulatory effect of CLL is believed to play a pivotal role in the low response rates to these immunotherapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize how CLL influences the function of non-malignant lymphocytes, with a special focus on T and NK cells, two important cellular mediators for immunotherapy. Secondly, we provide a short overview of the activity of several immunotherapeutics in CLL, and discuss how novel strategies may overcome the disappointing response rates in CLL.","['Hofland, Tom', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Tonino, Sanne H']","['Hofland T', 'Eldering E', 'Kater AP', 'Tonino SH']",,"['Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.h.tonino@amc.nl.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.h.tonino@amc.nl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190903,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6747204,['NOTNLM'],"['T cells', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer cells']",2019/09/06 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/09/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20174315 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20174315 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Sep 3;20(17). pii: ijms20174315. doi: 10.3390/ijms20174315.,20200127,,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous theoretical and experimental studies focus on probing the mechanisms caused by a single type of stimulus, while ignoring the synergetic effects, especially for single cell migration during cell-to-cell interaction. Here we develop a chemomechanical model to assess the biochemical and biophysical modulators of single cell migration during cell-to-cell interaction. This model considers the stimulation of chemoattractant concentration gradient, influence of dynamic adhesion strength and relative motion between cells. The model is validated with single cell manipulation of leukemia cancer cell on stromal cell layer using optical tweezers. Both the modeling and experimental results demonstrate that cell migration velocity caused by chemotaxis can be biased by dynamic adhesion force, which is related to the retrograde flow of stromal cell layer. Besides, the biophysical modulators can influence the effect of drug treatment for specific signaling pathway. Our work provides a quantitative description of single cell migration in a complex environment that is close to realistic in vivo situation and is useful for further exploration of cell signaling pathway during cell-to-cell interactions for investigation of potential therapeutic strategy.","['Gou, Xue', 'E, J C', 'Yang, Hao', 'Sun, Dong']","['Gou X', 'E JC', 'Yang H', 'Sun D']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190830,United States,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,0012737,,,,2019/09/05 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TBME.2019.2938569 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2020 May;67(5):1474-1482. doi: 10.1109/TBME.2019.2938569.

TET2, a member of this family, is frequently mutated in hematological disorders. The contributions of TET2 in hematopoiesis have been attributed to its DNA demethylase activity, and the significance of its nonenzymatic functions has remained undefined. To dissect the catalytic and non-catalytic requirements of Tet2, we engineered catalytically inactive Tet2 mutant mice and conducted comparative analyses of Tet2 mutant and Tet2 knockout animals. Tet2 knockout mice exhibited expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and developed myeloid and lymphoid disorders, while Tet2 mutant mice predominantly developed myeloid malignancies reminiscent of human myelodysplastic syndromes. HSPCs from Tet2 knockout mice exhibited distinct gene expression profiles, including downregulation of Gata2. Overexpression of Gata2 in Tet2 knockout bone marrow cells ameliorated disease phenotypes. Our results reveal the non-catalytic roles of TET2 in HSPC homeostasis.","['Ito, Kyoko', 'Lee, Joun', 'Chrysanthou, Stephanie', 'Zhao, Yilin', 'Josephs, Katherine', 'Sato, Hiroyo', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Zheng, Deyou', 'Dawlaty, Meelad M', 'Ito, Keisuke']","['Ito K', 'Lee J', 'Chrysanthou S', 'Zhao Y', 'Josephs K', 'Sato H', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Zheng D', 'Dawlaty MM', 'Ito K']",,"['Ruth L. and David S.

LncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) has been recognized as a tumour-promoting factor in various types of cancer. However, the biological role of SNHG16 and its underlying mechanism are still unknown in DLBCL. Here we disclosed that SNHG16 was overexpressed in DLBCL tissues and the derived cell lines. SNHG16 knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and it induced apoptosis of DLBCL cells in vitro. Furthermore, silencing of SNHG16 markedly repressed in vivo growth of OCI-LY7 cells. Mechanistically, SNHG16 directly interacted with miR-497-5p by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and inversely regulated the abundance of miR-497-5p in DLBCL cells. Moreover, the proto-oncogene proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus 1 (PIM1) was identified as a novel direct target of miR-497-5p. SNHG16 overexpression rescued miR-497-5p-induced down-regulation of PIM1 in DLBCL cells. Importantly, restoration of PIM1 expression reversed SNHG16 knockdown-induced inhibition of proliferation, G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis of OCI-LY7 cells.

The objective of the current study was to determine the prevalence, temporal trends, and factors associated with no active treatment (NAT) among older patients with AML in the United States. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data from 14,089 patients with AML residing in the United States who were diagnosed with AML at age >/=66 years during 2001 through 2013. NAT was defined as not receiving any chemotherapy, including hypomethylating agents. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze sociodemographic, clinical, and provider characteristics associated with NAT. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with NAT decreased over time from 59.7% among patients diagnosed in 2001 to 42.8% among those diagnosed in 2013. The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 82 days from the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with NAT had worse survival compared with those receiving active treatment. Variables found to be associated with higher odds of NAT included older age, certain sociodemographic characteristics (household income within the lowest quartile, residence outside the Northeast region of the United States, and being unmarried), and clinical factors (>/=3 comorbidities, the presence of mental disorders, recent hospitalization, and disability). CONCLUSIONS: Greater than one-half of older patients with AML residing in the United States do not receive any active leukemia-directed therapy despite the availability of lower intensity therapies such as hypomethylating agents. Lack of active therapy receipt is associated with inferior survival. Identifying predictors of NAT might improve the quality of care and survival in this patient population, especially as novel therapeutic options with lower toxicity are becoming available.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A', 'Wang, Xiaoyi', 'Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Shallis, Rory M', 'Huntington, Scott F', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Davidoff, Amy J', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Wang, Rong']","['Zeidan AM', 'Podoltsev NA', 'Wang X', 'Bewersdorf JP', 'Shallis RM', 'Huntington SF', 'Gore SD', 'Davidoff AJ', 'Ma X', 'Wang R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3657-778X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7071-6475', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8141-9249', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2169-4174']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['Celgene Corporation/International', 'Celgene/International', 'N02 PC015105/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services/International', 'Leukemia and Lymphoma Society/International', 'P30 CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC7733320,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Epidemiology', '*Surveillance', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*and End Results (SEER)-Medicare', '*elderly', '*no active treatment', '*outcome']",2019/09/05 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32439 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Dec 1;125(23):4241-4251. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32439.

RECENT FINDINGS: The noninferiority of haploidentical donors compared with other donor sources, including HLA-matched related or unrelated donors, has been demonstrated in patients with various hematological diseases. The development of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis using posttransplant cyclophosphamide has effectively reduced transplant-related mortality caused by GVHD, graft rejection, and other related complications. Novel GVHD prophylactic methods and other supportive strategies are under intense investigation to reduce the risk of infections and retain graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma effects after transplantation. SUMMARY: Recent progress in haploidentical stem cell transplantation has broadened the availability of donor sources for patients with hematological diseases. It is important to compare and examine the impact of donor sources on transplant outcomes to achieve a better understanding about the appropriate donor choice for each patient.","['Watanabe, Mizuki', 'Kanda, Junya']","['Watanabe M', 'Kanda J']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,2019/09/05 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000532 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Nov;26(6):406-412. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000532.,20200803,406-412,,,IM,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Disease Management', 'Donor Selection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have introduced the R178E mutation into the Trp53 gene of mice to specifically ablate the cooperative nature of p53 DNA binding. Trp53(R178E) mice show no detectable target gene regulation and, at first sight, are largely indistinguishable from Trp53(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, stabilization of p53(R178E) in Mdm2(-/-) mice nevertheless triggers extensive apoptosis, indicative of residual wild-type activities. Although this apoptotic activity suffices to trigger lethality of Trp53(R178E) ;Mdm2(-/-) embryos, it proves insufficient for suppression of spontaneous and oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. Trp53(R178E) mice develop tumors indistinguishably from Trp53(-/-) mice and tumors retain and even stabilize the p53(R178E) protein, further attesting to the lack of significant tumor suppressor activity. However, Trp53(R178E) tumors exhibit remarkably better chemotherapy responses than Trp53(-/-) ones, resulting in enhanced eradication of p53-mutated tumor cells. Together, this provides genetic proof-of-principle evidence that a p53 mutant can be highly tumorigenic and yet retain apoptotic activity which provides a survival benefit in the context of cancer therapy.","['Timofeev, Oleg', 'Klimovich, Boris', 'Schneikert, Jean', 'Wanzel, Michael', 'Pavlakis, Evangelos', 'Noll, Julia', 'Mutlu, Samet', 'Elmshauser, Sabrina', 'Nist, Andrea', 'Mernberger, Marco', 'Lamp, Boris', 'Wenig, Ulrich', 'Brobeil, Alexander', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Kohler, Kernt', 'Stiewe, Thorsten']","['Timofeev O', 'Klimovich B', 'Schneikert J', 'Wanzel M', 'Pavlakis E', 'Noll J', 'Mutlu S', 'Elmshauser S', 'Nist A', 'Mernberger M', 'Lamp B', 'Wenig U', 'Brobeil A', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Kohler K', 'Stiewe T']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0134-7826'],"['Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Center, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany.', 'German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Center, Marburg, Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['STI 182/7-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)/International', 'TI 1028/2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)/International', '111250/Deutsche Krebshilfe/International', '111444/Deutsche Krebshilfe/International', '70112623/Deutsche Krebshilfe/International', '13/08/Deutsche Jose Carreras Leukamie Stiftung e.V./International', '09 R/2018/Deutsche Jose Carreras Leukamie Stiftung e.V./International', '031L0063/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', 'German Center for Lung Research/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,PMC6792016,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mdm2', '*apoptosis', '*mutant p53', '*p53', '*tumor suppression']",2019/09/05 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.15252/embj.2019102096 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2019 Oct 15;38(20):e102096. doi: 10.15252/embj.2019102096.

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the prognostic effect of DNMT3A mutations in patients with MDS. Methods: Eligible studies from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Trials and the Cochrane Library were searched. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were pooled to assess the effect of DNMT3A mutations on the prognosis in MDS patients. Results: A total of 12 studies with 2236 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled HRs for OS and LFS revealed that MDS patients with DNMT3A mutations had a significantly poor prognosis as compared with those without mutations (OS: HR = 1.654, 95% CI = 1.387-1.973, p < 0.001; LFS: HR = 4.624, 95% CI = 3.121-6.851, p < 0.001). Discussion and Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed an adverse prognostic effect of DNMT3A mutations in patients with MDS, which will contribute to risk stratification and prognostic assessment in the disease.","['Liang, Simin', 'Zhou, Xiaojia', 'Pan, Hui', 'Yang, Yichun', 'Shi, Lin', 'Wang, Li']","['Liang S', 'Zhou X', 'Pan H', 'Yang Y', 'Shi L', 'Wang L']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['mutations', 'hypomethylating agents', 'leukemia-free survival', 'meta-analysis', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'overall survival', 'prognosis', 'risk factors']",2019/09/05 06:00,2020/01/31 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1657613 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):613-622. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1657613.,20200130,613-622,,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study enrolled biopsy proven newly diagnosed pediatric LL patients presenting in the Children Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE) during the period from October 2014 to October 2016. 18F-FDG-PET/CT was done initially before therapy and after induction chemotherapy in all patients. The patients were followed until the end of April 2018 (mean 23.5 months). RESULTS: All lymphoma involvement lesions (n = 43) were FDG avid and the intensity of nodal FDG uptake was variable. Two patients (11%) had bone marrow (BM) involvement by < 25% blast cells with corresponding positive BM focal uptake in 18F-FDG-PET/CT (SUVmax = 4 and 4.5). Evaluation post induction phase; CT detected 8 residual lesions in 8 patients (44.4%), while 18F-FDG-PET/CT detected only 3 Deauville-positive residual lesions in 3 patients (16.6%). No intensification of therapy was done in all post-induction positive patients. Repeated 18F-FDG-PET/CT at week 18 for post-induction patients revealed cleared all Deauville-positive residual lesions. On the other hand, repeated CT at week 18 detected regression but still residual in 4/8 (50%) post-induction CT lesions with clearance of the rest (50%). CONCLUSION: In initial staging, 18F-FDG-PET/CT is a useful tool for disease extent evaluation of pediatric LL. Moreover, it could provide a diagnostic hint for BM involvement. 18F-FDG-PET/CT done after induction therapy has a good negative predictive value with higher specificity than CT alone, but is not an indication for treatment intensification due to false positive results. However, larger sample size is required for better conclusion.","['Elhussein, Ahmed', 'Fawzy, Mohamed', 'Abdel Rahman, Hany', 'Omar, Walid', 'Hussein, Elshaymaa Mohamed']","['Elhussein A', 'Fawzy M', 'Abdel Rahman H', 'Omar W', 'Hussein EM']",,"[""Consultant of pediatric oncology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE 57357)., seket elemam street, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Professor of pediatric oncology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE/57357)., seket el emam, cairo, Egypt."", ""Professor of pediatric oncology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE/57357)., seket el emam, cairo, Egypt."", 'Professor of nuclear medicine, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University., cairo, Egypt.', 'consultant of nuclear medicine, department of nuclear medicine andradiation oncology, faculty of medicine, cairo university, cairo, Egypt. elshaymaahussein@cu.edu.eg.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur,Nuclear medicine review.

Useful therapeutic targets are normally unique peculiarities of cancer cells that distinguish them from normal cells and that can be tackled with appropriate drugs. It is now known that cell metabolism is rewired during tumorigenesis and metastasis as a consequence of oncogene activation and oncosuppressors inactivation, leading to a new cellular homeostasis typically directed towards anabolism. Because of these modifications, cells can become strongly or absolutely dependent on specific substrates, like sugars, lipids or amino acids. Cancer addictions are a relevant target for therapy, as removal of an essential substrate can lead to their selective cell-cycle arrest or even to cell death, leaving normal cells untouched. Enzymes can act as powerful agents in this respect, as demonstrated by asparaginase, which has been included in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for half a century. In this review, a short outline of cancer addictions will be provided, focusing on the main cancer amino acid dependencies described so far. Therapeutic enzymes which have been already experimented at the clinical level will be discussed, along with novel potential candidates that we propose as new promising molecules. The intrinsic limitations of their present molecular forms, along with molecular engineering solutions to explore, will also be presented.","['Maggi, Maristella', 'Scotti, Claudia']","['Maggi M', 'Scotti C']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Unit of Immunology and General Pathology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. maristella.maggi01@universitadipavia.it.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Unit of Immunology and General Pathology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,['NOTNLM'],"['Arginase', 'Arginine deaminase', 'Asparaginase', 'Cancer addictions', 'Glutaminase']",2019/09/05 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7709-9_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1148:173-199. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7709-9_9.,20190912,173-199,,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Enzymes)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*chemistry', 'Asparaginase', 'Enzyme Therapy', 'Enzymes/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Enzyme-based therapies are currently in use for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including leukemia, metabolic disorders, inflammation and cardiovascular disease. However, several challenges, such as immunogenicity and stability, remain. X-ray crystallography has provided key structural insights into the understanding of the molecular basis of diseases and development of enzyme-based therapies.

An array of therapeutic enzymes has been developed for a variety of human diseases, including leukaemia and enzyme-deficiency diseases such as Gaucher's disease. Production and testing of therapeutic enzymes is strictly governed by regulatory bodies in each country around the world, and batch-to-batch consistency is crucially important. Manufacture of a batch starts with the fermentation or cell culture stage. After expression of the therapeutic enzyme in a cell culture bioreactor, robust and reproducible protein purification, or downstream processing (DSP) of the target product, is critical to ensuring safe delivery of these medicines. Modern processing technology, including the use of disposable processing equipment, has greatly improved the DSP development pathway in terms of robustness and speed to clinic. Once purified, the drug substance undergoes rigorous quality control (QC) testing according to current regulatory guidance, to enable release to the clinic and patient. QC testing is conducted to ensure the safety, purity, identity, potency and strength of the medicinal product, requiring multiple analytical methods that are rigorously validated and monitored for robust performance. Several case studies, including L-asparaginase and asfotase alfa, are discussed to illustrate the methods described herein.","['Gervais, David']",['Gervais D'],,"['Porton Biopharma Limited, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK. dave.gervais@portonbiopharma.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,['NOTNLM'],"['Downstream processing', 'Enzyme characterisation', 'Enzyme manufacturing', 'Quality control', 'Therapeutic enzymes']",2019/09/05 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7709-9_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1148:55-80. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7709-9_3.,20190912,55-80,,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Enzymes)']",IM,"['Biological Products', 'Bioreactors', 'Enzymes/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Fermentation', 'Humans', '*Quality Control']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the combination of ERK2 inhibitor VX-11e and voreloxin on MOLM-14, K562, REH and MOLT-4 leukemia cell lines. We found that VX-11e alone and in combination with voreloxin significantly decreased ERK activation in all cell lines tested. To evaluate the interactions of the drugs, cells were treated for 24 h with VX-11e or voreloxin alone and in combination at fixed ratios based on IC50 values. The combinatorial effects of both drugs were synergistic over a wide range of concentrations in MOLM-14, REH and MOLT-4 cell lines. In K562 cells, three effects were found to be additive, one antagonistic and only one synergistic. The results showed that incubation with both VX-11e and voreloxin inhibited the growth of leukemia cells, affected cell cycle and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of these effects might be attributed to an increased expression of p21 and a decreased expression of survivin and NF-kappaB in all cell lines tested except from K562 cells. In conclusion, combination of VX-11e and voreloxin can exert a synergistic anticancer effect in leukemia cells.","['Jasek-Gajda, Ewa', 'Jurkowska, Halina', 'Jasinska, Malgorzata', 'Litwin, Jan A', 'Lis, Grzegorz J']","['Jasek-Gajda E', 'Jurkowska H', 'Jasinska M', 'Litwin JA', 'Lis GJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2030-0356', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0984-220X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8102-6039', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6100-2622', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0467-8519']","['Department of Histology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kopernika 7, 31034, Krakow, Poland. ewa.jasek@uj.edu.pl.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kopernika 7, 31034, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kopernika 7, 31034, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kopernika 7, 31034, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],['K/ZDS/007917/Uniwersytet Jagiellonski Collegium Medicum/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,PMC6823322,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell cycle', '*Leukemia cell lines', '*VX-11e', '*Voreloxin']",2019/09/05 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10495-019-01564-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-019-01564-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2019 Dec;24(11-12):849-861. doi: 10.1007/s10495-019-01564-6.,20200803,849-861,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Naphthyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have reported the potential poor prognostic impact of EVI1 higher expression (EVI1(H)) in the AML patients; however, the conclusions previously reported have not been fully assessed and are still controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic significance of EVI1(H) in patients with AML. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the event-free survival (EFS) was selected as the secondary endpoint. We extracted the hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) for the OS and EFS from the multivariate COX proportional hazard models. A total of 4767 AML patients from 11 studies up to 23 February 2019 were subjected to our meta-analysis. Pooled HRs suggested that EVI1(H) had an adverse impact on OS (HR = 1.52, 95%CI 1.24-1.86) and EFS (HR = 1.41, 95%CI 1.14-1.74) in AML patients. EVI1(H) was also associated with a shorter OS (HR = 1.73, 95%CI 1.43-2.11) and EFS (HR = 1.17, 95%CI 1.05-1.31) in AML patients with the intermediate cytogenetic risk (ICR) according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European leukemia network (ELN), or International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). Furthermore, EVI1(H) appeared to be a poor prognosis indicator in patients with normal cytogenetics (NC) (HR for OS:2.01, 95%CI 1.32-3.05; HR for EFS 1.54, 95%CI 1.09-2.17) and young patients (HR for OS 1.30, 95%CI 1.09-1.55), respectively. This meta-analysis indicates EVI1(H) has an independent and significantly adverse prognostic impact on AML patients in the entire population, and this conclusion same applies to some subgroups like AML patients with ICR, NC, and young AML patients.","['Wu, Xia', 'Wang, Huifang', 'Deng, Jili', 'Zheng, Xue', 'Ling, Yantao', 'Gong, Yuping']","['Wu X', 'Wang H', 'Deng J', 'Zheng X', 'Ling Y', 'Gong Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2437-9348'],"['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37 GuoXue Xiang, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37 GuoXue Xiang, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37 GuoXue Xiang, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37 GuoXue Xiang, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37 GuoXue Xiang, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37 GuoXue Xiang, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China. gongyuping2010@aliyun.com.']",['eng'],"['2016-HM01-00001-SF/Foundation of Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau', '2015SZ0234-5/Foundation of the Science & Technology Department of Sichuan', 'Province']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20190903,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'EVI1', 'Expression', 'Meta-analysis', 'Prognosis']",2019/09/05 06:00,2019/11/22 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03774-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03774-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Nov;98(11):2485-2496. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03774-z.

We studied in a phase II trial whether the addition of peri-transplant rituximab would reduce the relapse risk compared with historical controls (n = 157). Patients (n = 55) received fludarabine and low-dose total body irradiation combined with rituximab on days -3, + 10, + 24, + 36. Relapse rate at 3 years was significantly lower among rituximab-treated patients versus controls (17% versus 31%; P = 0.04). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were statistically similar: (53% versus 50%; P = 0.8), (44% versus 42%; P = 0.63), and (38% versus 28%; P = 0.2), respectively. In multivariate analysis, rituximab treatment was associated with lower relapse rates both in the overall cohort [hazard ratio (HR): 0.34, P = 0.006] and in patients with high-risk cytogenetics (HR: 0.21, P = 0.0003). Patients with no comorbidities who received rituximab conditioning had an OS rate of 100% and 75% at 1 and 3 years, respectively, with no NRM.

The study objective was to determine the prevalence of leukemia survivors among pregnant women and to examine the maternal and fetal outcomes of this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study on all births recorded in the Health - Care Cost and Utilization Project - Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1999 and 2014. We measured the prevalence of leukemia survivors in pregnancy and performed multivariate logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios for maternal and fetal outcomes among this group compared to a nonaffected one. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 14,513,587 births, of which 1,269 were to women with a history of leukemia or leukemia in remission, corresponding to a prevalence of 8.74 per 100,000 births. The prevalence rose steadily over the 16-year study period. Pregnant women who were leukemia survivors were more likely to experience gestational diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.70), threatened preterm labor (1.50, 1.09-2.08), venous thromboembolism (4.40, 2.86-6.78), and to require blood transfusions (1.89, 1.24-2.88). Preterm deliveries (1.25, 1.02-1.54) and congenital anomalies (2.32, 1.39-3.86) among their newborns were also more common. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of leukemia survivors among pregnant women has been steadily rising. While the disease may no longer be active during their pregnancy, leukemia survivors appeared to have increased risks of several adverse outcomes and as such, should be monitored closely in centers with access to specialized care.","['Nolan, Sabrina', 'Czuzoj-Shulman, Nicholas', 'Abenhaim, Haim Arie']","['Nolan S', 'Czuzoj-Shulman N', 'Abenhaim HA']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Community Studies, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Community Studies, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190918,England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer survivor', 'fetal outcomes', 'leukemia', 'leukemia survivor', 'maternal outcomes', 'pregnancy']",2019/09/05 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14767058.2019.1663818 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2021 Jul;34(14):2283-2289. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2019.1663818.

Using the zebrafish, we found that azacitidine destroyed their myeloid precursors and impaired myeloid function by inhibiting antigen processing, allogeneic response and phagocytic activity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection even by the normal flora E. coli. In addition, iron overload, a MDS-associated condition following repeated transfusions, exacerbated bacterial infection especially by V. vulnificus with known iron dependence. Furthermore, we show that the tp53(M214K) mutant zebrafish survived longer than the wild-type (WT) when challenged with bacteria following azacitidine treatment. This was attributed to the mutant's hematopoietic cells rather than its general genetic background, since the WT animals reconstituted with the tp53(M214K) mutant kidney marrow became more resistant to bacterial infection following treatment with azacitidine. The clinical relevance of our findings was indicated by a MDS case with severe azacitidine-induced bone marrow suppression and by the association of hyperferritinemia with bacteremia in azacitidine-treated patients, while tp53(M214K)-mediated resistance to azacitidine-induced myelosuppression may explain the survival advantage of malignant MDS and AML clones over their normal counterparts under azacitidine treatment. Together, we propose that myelosuppression, iron overload and TP53 mutations may represent the host variables that compromise the azacitidine efficacy.","['Wang, Shu-Ching', 'Wu, Ching-Tse', 'Wu, Dong-Yu', 'Chen, Caleb Gon-Shen', 'Chang, Kuo-Ming', 'Chang, Chien-Chung']","['Wang SC', 'Wu CT', 'Wu DY', 'Chen CG', 'Chang KM', 'Chang CC']",,"['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei 10449, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hsinchu Mackay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu 35071, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan. ccchang@life.nthu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan. ccchang@life.nthu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['MOST 104-2320-B-007-002, MOST 106-2320-B-007-001, MOST', '107-2320-B-007-002/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan']",['Journal Article'],20190902,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC6770285,['NOTNLM'],"['azacitidine', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myelosuppression']",2019/09/05 06:00,2019/09/05 06:01,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/05 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11091294 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11091294 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Sep 2;11(9). pii: cancers11091294. doi: 10.3390/cancers11091294.,,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence rates of solid cancers were analyzed for the 1990-2016 period in cleanup workers, evacuees, and the general population from the contaminated areas. In male cleanup workers, the significant increase in rates was demonstrated for cancers in total, leukemia, lymphoma, and thyroid cancer, as well as breast cancer rates were increased in females. Significantly elevated thyroid cancer incidence was identified in the male cleanup workers cohort (150,813) in 1986-2012 with an overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.35 (95% CI: 2.91-3.80). A slight decrease in incidence rates was registered starting at 25 years after exposure. In total, 32 of 57 deaths in a group of cleanup workers with confirmed acute radiation syndrome (ARS) or not confirmed ARS (ARS NC) were due to blood malignancies or cancer. Molecular studies in cohort members included gene expression and polymorphism, FISH, relative telomere length, immunophenotype, micronuclei test, histone H2AX, and TORCH infections. Analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases from the cohort showed more frequent mutations in telomere maintenance pathway genes as compared with unexposed CLL patients.","['Bazyka, Dimitry', 'Gudzenko, Natalya', 'Dyagil, Iryna', 'Ilienko, Iryna', 'Belyi, David', 'Chumak, Vadim', 'Prysyazhnyuk, Anatoly', 'Bakhanova, Elena']","['Bazyka D', 'Gudzenko N', 'Dyagil I', 'Ilienko I', 'Belyi D', 'Chumak V', 'Prysyazhnyuk A', 'Bakhanova E']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9982-5990', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6643-4141', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6045-9356']","['National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine. bazyka@yahoo.com.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov str, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190902,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC6770927,['NOTNLM'],"['Chornobyl (Chernobyl)', 'breast cancer', 'cleanup workers', 'leukemia', 'telomere length', 'thyroid cancer']",2019/09/05 06:00,2019/09/05 06:01,['2019/09/05 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/05 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11091291 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11091291 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Sep 2;11(9). pii: cancers11091291. doi: 10.3390/cancers11091291.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigates the anti-cancer properties of an Annona cherimola Mill ethanolic seed extract on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell lines in vitro and elucidates the underlying cellular mechanism. The anti-proliferative effects of the extract on various AML cell lines and normal mesenchymal cells (MSCs) were assessed using WST-1 viability reagent. The pro-apoptotic effect of the extract was evaluated using Annexin V/PI staining and Cell Death ELISA. The underlying mechanism was deciphered by analyzing the expression of various proteins using western blots. Treatment with an A. cherimola seed ethanolic extract promotes a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the proliferation of various AML cell lines, but not MSCs. Positive Annexin V staining, as well as DNA fragmentation, confirm an increase in apoptotic cell death by upregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins which control both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of phytosterols, in addition to other bioactive compounds. In conclusion, Annona cherimola Mill seed extract, previously known to possess a potent toxic activity, induces apoptosis in AML cell lines by the activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways.","['Haykal, Tony', 'Nasr, Peter', 'Hodroj, Mohammad H', 'Taleb, Robin I', 'Sarkis, Rita', 'Moujabber, Marvy Nadine El', 'Rizk, Sandra']","['Haykal T', 'Nasr P', 'Hodroj MH', 'Taleb RI', 'Sarkis R', 'Moujabber MNE', 'Rizk S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4405-5703'],"['Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Regenerative Hematopoiesis, Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) & Institute of Bioengineering (IBI), School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, City University of New York, New York, NY 10027, USA.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 13-5053, Lebanon.

Patients with post-MF acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be treated with curative or noncurative intent, but there is no standard of care. The use of hypomethylating agents has been correlated with limited activity and low overall survival rates, while ruxolitinib has been proven to have modest antileukemic activity. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case study, we present the case of a 67-year-old female patient with post-polycythemia vera MF who developed AML and was successfully treated with a combination of 5-azacytidine and ruxolitinib, without any significant toxicity. SUMMARY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with post-MF AML achieving a complete remission with a combination of ruxolitinib and a hypomethylating agent.

Other approaches in the search for new and modifiable prognostic factors are necessary to continue to improve these rates. The importance of environmental factors in the etiopathogenesis of childhood ALL has been regaining interest but its role in the prognosis and survival of this disease is not well explored. We aim to investigate the association between secondhand smoke (SHS) and survival in children diagnosed with ALL. METHODS: We analyzed survival rates in 146 patients under the age of 15 years diagnosed with ALL between January 1998 and May 2016 in the Region of Murcia, Spain. Evaluation of parental SHS and other known prognostic factors (sex, age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, cytogenetics, NCI/Rome Criteria, early response to therapy, and relapse) were assessed for impact on OS, event-free survival (EFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and treatment-related mortality (CITRM) using Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, and Fine-Gray model. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 105.3 months (+/-66.5). Prenatal exposure to SHS due to parental smoking was highly prevalent. Of the mothers, 44.4% and 55.5% of the fathers smoked at some point during pregnancy. After the child's diagnosis of ALL 39.7% of mothers and 45.9% of fathers reported smoking. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy and after diagnosis (HR=4.396, 95% CI: 1.173-16.474, p=0.028); and relapse (HR=7.919; 95% CI: 2.683-21.868; p<0.001) are independent prognostic factors in determining survival. The Fine-Gray model showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy and after diagnosis (HR=14.525, 95% CI: 4.228-49.90, p<0.001) is an independent prognostic factor in CITRM. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent SHS worsens OS and TRM in children with ALL. This negative impact contributes to a different prognosis and may possibly provide an exceptional insight into new therapeutic approaches, including environmental aspects such as prevention and smoking cessation to improve survival outcomes.","['Carceles-Alvarez, Alberto', 'Ortega-Garcia, Juan A', 'Lopez-Hernandez, Fernando A', 'Fuster-Soler, Jose L', 'Ramis, Rebeca', 'Kloosterman, Nicole', 'Castillo, Luis', 'Sanchez-Solis, Manuel', 'Claudio, Luz', 'Ferris-Tortajada, Josep']","['Carceles-Alvarez A', 'Ortega-Garcia JA', 'Lopez-Hernandez FA', 'Fuster-Soler JL', 'Ramis R', 'Kloosterman N', 'Castillo L', 'Sanchez-Solis M', 'Claudio L', 'Ferris-Tortajada J']",,"['European and Latin American Environment, Survival and Childhood Cancer Network (ENSUCHICA), Spain; Pediatric Environmental Health Speciality Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Environment and Human Health (A5), Institute of Biomedical Research (IMIB-Arrixaca), Clinical University Hospital ""Virgen de la Arrixaca"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'European and Latin American Environment, Survival and Childhood Cancer Network (ENSUCHICA), Spain; Pediatric Environmental Health Speciality Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Environment and Human Health (A5), Institute of Biomedical Research (IMIB-Arrixaca), Clinical University Hospital ""Virgen de la Arrixaca"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.

This study aimed to examine the effect of decitabine (DAC) on FLT3-ITD positive AML. In our study, we found that expression of FLT3 and its downstream targets was decreased in FLT3-ITD mutant cell lines treated with DAC. DAC treatment could increase the percentage of apoptotic cells and CD11b positive cells tested by flow cytometry and upregulate the expression of cleaved caspase3, cleaved PARP, C/EBPa and PU.1 detected by western blot. To explore the effect of increased expression of PU.1 on FLT3 protein, we transiently transfected MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells with siRNA against PU.1 and a siRNA control. In both FLT3-ITD positive cells, the effect of DAC on downregulation of FLT3 was diminished in PU.1-konckdown MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells and there was a decrease of CD11b expression after PU.1 knockdown. Furthermore, the percentage of apoptotic cells was also decreased in PU.1-konckdown cells compared with siRNA control-expressing cells with the same dose of DAC. These findings indicated that DAC upregulated PU.1 to induce downregulation of FLT3 to trigger apoptosis. DAC was also found efficacious in mouse xenograft models of FLT3-ITD AML in our study. These findings may provide a novel theoretical basis for treatment of FLT3-ITD positive AML patients.","['Hu, Xiaoli', 'Cai, Jiayi', 'Zhu, Jianyi', 'Lang, Wenjing', 'Zhong, Jihua', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Chen, Fangyuan']","['Hu X', 'Cai J', 'Zhu J', 'Lang W', 'Zhong J', 'Zhong H', 'Chen F']",,"['Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China..

We examined the pattern and rate of occult N1 nodal metastasis in patients with peripheral, small (</=2 cm), clinically node-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Patients with peripheral small (</=2 cm) NSCLC with no evidence of locally advanced or metastatic disease (clinical T1a-b N0 M0, American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition Cancer Staging Manual), who were deemed eligible for lobectomy or sublobar resection, were identified from preregistration eligibility screening logs for the Alliance/Cancer and Leukemia Group B 140503 trial at our institution. Pathologic outcomes were examined in all patients undergoing anatomic resection with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: Included were 58 patients treated between November 2014 and January 2017 who met the inclusion criteria: 51 underwent lobectomy, and 7 underwent segmentectomy. Mean tumor diameter on computed tomography was 1.5 cm, and mean positron emission tomography maximal standardized uptake value was 3.9. The mean consolidation-to-tumor ratio was 0.77. Occult nodal metastases in N1 stations were found in 8 of 58 patients (14%), and most of these nodes were found in interlobar or peribronchial stations (11 or 12). An additional 2 patients (3%) had occult positive N2 nodes. Overall, the false-negative rate for clinical staging was 16%. CONCLUSIONS: Occult nodal disease was frequently identified in peripheral N1 stations (11-13) in patients with small (</=2 cm) clinical N0 NSCLC. Hilar lymphadenectomy is essential for accurate staging in the management of patients with small clinical N0 NSCLC.","['Robinson, Eric M', 'Ilonen, Ilkka K', 'Tan, Kay See', 'Plodkowski, Andrew J', 'Bott, Matthew', 'Bains, Manjit S', 'Adusumilli, Prasad S', 'Park, Bernard J', 'Rusch, Valerie W', 'Jones, David R', 'Huang, James']","['Robinson EM', 'Ilonen IK', 'Tan KS', 'Plodkowski AJ', 'Bott M', 'Bains MS', 'Adusumilli PS', 'Park BJ', 'Rusch VW', 'Jones DR', 'Huang J']",,"['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.

METHODS: We performed FC using a standardized panel and two different diagnostic algorithms (Ogata, Wells) in a well-characterized cohort of 79 patients with ICUS/CCUS and compared it with a retrospective blinded morphological evaluation and data from targeted next-generation DNA sequencing of 20 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related genes. RESULTS: Our data show that FC has low sensitivity in distinguishing CCUS from ICUS patients (40.5% for Ogata score and 59.5% for Wells score). The Wells score was suggestive of dysplasia in ICUS/CCUS patients with concurrent morphological signs of dysplasia in the bone marrow (following re-evaluation by two hematopathologists) and in CCUS patients with a higher mutational burden. Eight patients with ICUS/CCUS from our cohort progressed to another myeloid malignancy (MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), all showing flow cytometric signs of dysplasia. CONCLUSION: FC performs poorly in diagnosing CCUS versus ICUS. However, it can potentially provide prognostic information in cytopenic patients by identifying a subgroup of patients with a higher grade of dysplasia, higher mutational burden, and higher risk of progression and, together with mutational screening, also identify a group of patients who might require morphological reassessment of dysplastic changes in their bone marrow.","['Dimopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Hansen, Olga Kristina', 'Sjo, Lene Dissing', 'Saft, Leonie', 'Schjodt, Ida Marianne', 'Werner Hansen, Jakob', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Dimopoulos K', 'Hansen OK', 'Sjo LD', 'Saft L', 'Schjodt IM', 'Werner Hansen J', 'Gronbaek K']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8402-500X'],"['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, DanStem, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, DanStem, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190903,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

CLINICAL FINDINGS: Physical examination revealed no peripheral lymphadenopathy or other abnormalities. Results of an abdominal palpation examination per rectum and thoracic and abdominal ultrasonographic examinations were unremarkable. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was diagnosed on the basis of severe lymphocytosis and positive expression of the B-cell marker CD20 by lymphocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Treatment with prednisolone (2 mg/kg [0.9 mg/lb], PO, every other day) and chlorambucil (20 mg/m(2), PO, every 3 weeks for 2 doses, then every 2 weeks) was initially associated with improvement in clinical signs and a decrease in the lymphocyte count. However, 3 weeks after administration of the first dose of chlorambucil, the lymphocyte count began to increase. One week later, the horse developed episodes of recurrent fever and the lymphocyte count continued to increase. Despite continued administration of the prednisolone-chlorambucil protocol, the horse's clinical condition deteriorated rapidly, and it was euthanized 6 weeks after initial examination at the referral hospital because of a poor prognosis. A necropsy was not performed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: B-cell CLL has been infrequently described in horses. This report was the first to describe the use of chemotherapy, albeit unsuccessful, for the treatment of B-cell CLL in a horse. This information should be useful for guiding expectations for prognosis and management of other horses affected with the disease.","['Long, Alicia E', 'Javsicas, Laura H', 'Stokol, Tracy', 'Felippe, M Julia B', 'Frimberger, Angela E']","['Long AE', 'Javsicas LH', 'Stokol T', 'Felippe MJB', 'Frimberger AE']",,,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,,,,2019/09/04 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/javma.255.6.716 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2019 Sep 15;255(6):716-721. doi: 10.2460/javma.255.6.716.,20200701,716-721,,['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Chlorambucil', 'Horse Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Horses', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Male', '*Physical Conditioning, Animal']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Children of advanced age fathers have a higher incidence of early onset cancer and neuropsychiatric disease. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the number of population adjusted cases of early-onset cancer and neuropsychiatric disease in children attributable to increasing paternal age in the United States. METHODS: Paternal age in the United States from 1972 to 2015 was collected using the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Population attributable fraction and paternal age-specific cumulative incidence rates of several cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders were obtained from peer-reviewed publications. Paternal age-specific birth rates were correlated with paternal age-specific cumulative incidence rates to determine the number of attributable cases of disease caused by advancing age of fathers in the United States. RESULTS: The 2015 birth cohort in the United States is estimated to expect 9.2% more cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed before 16 years of age (157 additional cases), 13.2% more cases of embryonal tumors in children <5 years of age (209 additional cases), and 13.0% more cases of breast cancer in females younger than 40 years old (424 additional cases) compared to the 1972 birth cohort. We can estimate to expect 10.5% more cases of schizophrenia diagnosed before 21 years of age (2864 additional cases), 6.3% more cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adolescents <17 years of age (2934 additional cases), 4.5% more cases of anorexia nervosa (AN) in females 8-30 years old (620 additional cases), and 9.2% more cases of bipolar disorder in young patients 16-25 years old (252 additional cases) in the 2015 birth cohort compared to the 1972 birth cohort. CONCLUSION: Increasing paternal age in the United States is associated with a substantial increase in the number of cases of early-onset cancer and neuropsychiatric disease in offspring.","['Greenberg, D R', 'Khandwala, Y S', 'Lu, Y', 'Stevenson, D K', 'Shaw, G M', 'Eisenberg, M L']","['Greenberg DR', 'Khandwala YS', 'Lu Y', 'Stevenson DK', 'Shaw GM', 'Eisenberg ML']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5050-7414'],"['Department of Urology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Urology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Urology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190903,England,Andrology,Andrology,101585129,,['NOTNLM'],"['*birth', '*cancer', '*neuropsychiatric', '*offspring', '*paternal age', '*reproduction']",2019/09/04 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/andr.12700 [doi]'],ppublish,Andrology. 2020 Mar;8(2):342-347. doi: 10.1111/andr.12700.

Based on our recent findings, we discuss the concept of CTLA4Ig-primed donor lymphocyte infusions following haploidentical transplantation as an effective tool to garner NK cell-mediated antitumor effect with abrogation of T cell-mediated alloreactivity. This approach might widen the possibility of immunotherapy following haploidentical transplantation without increase in graft-versus-host disease. Further studies would be needed to establish the veracity of this concept with better understanding of the antitumor effect via this pathway.

However, the mutational profile within these groups is highly heterogeneous and multiple AML subclones may exist in a single patient in parallel. Distinct alterations of single cells may be key factors in providing the fitness to survive in this highly competitive environment. Although the majority of AML patients initially respond to induction chemotherapy and achieve a complete remission, most patients will eventually relapse. These points toward an evolutionary process transforming treatment-sensitive cells into treatment-resistant cells. As described by Charles Darwin, evolution by natural selection is the selection of individuals that are optimally adapted to their environment, based on the random acquisition of heritable changes. By changing their mutational profile, AML cell populations are able to adapt to the new environment defined by chemotherapy treatment, ultimately leading to cell survival and regrowth. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about clonal evolution in AML, describe different models of clonal evolution, and provide the methodological background that allows the detection of clonal evolution in individual AML patients. During the last years, numerous studies have focused on delineating the molecular patterns that are associated with AML relapse, each focusing on a particular genetic subgroup of AML. Finally, we will review the results of these studies in the light of Darwinian evolution and discuss open questions regarding the molecular background of relapse development.","['Vosberg, Sebastian', 'Greif, Philipp A']","['Vosberg S', 'Greif PA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8464-1483'],"['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190903,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,PMC6852285,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*clonal evolution', '*next generation sequencing', '*relapse', '*therapy resistance']",2019/09/04 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22806 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Dec;58(12):839-849. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22806.

PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) testing is a useful diagnostic tool to assess clonality of a lymphoid population. Previous feline PARR studies evaluated clonality of complete immunoglobulin heavy chain V-D-J (IGH-VDJ) and T-cell receptor gamma (TRG) gene rearrangements. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of feline PARR primers targeting complete IGH-VDJ and TRG rearrangements, as well as incomplete IGH-DJ, kappa deleting element (Kde), and immunoglobulin lambda light chain (IGL) gene rearrangements in defined feline neoplasms and nonneoplastic controls. METHODS: Fluorescently labeled PCR primers were designed to amplify complete IGH-VDJ, incomplete IGH-DJ, Kde, IGL, and TRG gene rearrangements in two multiplexed PCR reactions, and PCR products were analyzed by fragment analysis. Fresh tissue samples from 12 flow cytometrically confirmed B-cell lymphomas, 26 cytologically confirmed gastric and renal lymphomas of presumed B-cell origin, 30 flow cytometrically confirmed T-cell leukemias, and 11 negative control cats were tested. RESULTS: Using four immunoglobulin primer sets (IGH-VDJ, IGH-DJ, Kde, and IGL), clonal immunoglobulin rearrangements were detected in 87% (33/38) of the presumed B-cell neoplasms. The IGH-VDJ reaction alone only detected clonality in 50% (19/38) of these cases. TRG rearrangements were clonal in 97% (29/30) of the T-cell leukemia cases. All negative control samples had polyclonal immunoglobulin and TRG rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: The PARR assay developed in this study is useful for assessing clonality in feline lymphoid neoplasms. Clonality assessment of incomplete IGH-DJ, Kde, and IGL rearrangements helped identify clonal B-cell neoplasms not detected with complete IGH-VDJ PARR alone.","['Rout, Emily D', 'Burnett, Robert C', 'Yoshimoto, Janna A', 'Avery, Paul R', 'Avery, Anne C']","['Rout ED', 'Burnett RC', 'Yoshimoto JA', 'Avery PR', 'Avery AC']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1435-8532'],"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190902,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell receptor gamma', 'antigen receptor rearrangement', 'lymphoma']",2019/09/04 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vcp.12767 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2019 Oct;48 Suppl 1:45-58. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12767.

Moreover, 40-60% of patients relapse owing to poor CAR T cell persistence or emergence of CD19(-) clones. Some factors, including the choice of single-chain spacer(6) and extracellular(7) and costimulatory domains(8), have a profound effect on CAR T cell function and persistence. However, little is known about the impact of CAR binding affinity. There is evidence of a ceiling above which increased immunoreceptor affinity may adversely affect T cell responses(9-11). We generated a novel CD19 CAR (CAT) with a lower affinity than FMC63, the high-affinity binder used in many clinical studies(1-4). CAT CAR T cells showed increased proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro and had enhanced proliferative and in vivo antitumor activity compared with FMC63 CAR T cells. In a clinical study (CARPALL, NCT02443831 ), 12/14 patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with CAT CAR T cells achieved molecular remission. Persistence was demonstrated in 11 of 14 patients at last follow-up, with enhanced CAR T cell expansion compared with published data. Toxicity was low, with no severe CRS. One-year overall and event-free survival were 63% and 46%, respectively.","['Ghorashian, Sara', 'Kramer, Anne Marijn', 'Onuoha, Shimobi', 'Wright, Gary', 'Bartram, Jack', 'Richardson, Rachel', 'Albon,

It may be caused by deletion of 17p involving the loss of TP53 gene, which occurs in low percentage of patients at diagnosis but can be acquired as the disease progresses. Since patients may harbor TP53 mutation without chromosome 17p deletion, consensus recommendations call for both cytogenetic and PCR mutation analysis of TP53 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We conducted a single-institution retrospective study to investigate the clinicopathologic features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with TP53 alterations as well as the utility of different diagnostic modalities to identify p53 alterations. Forty percent of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with TP53 alterations demonstrated atypical lymphocytes with cleaved/irregularly shaped nuclei and/or large atypical lymphoid cells with abundant cytoplasm in the peripheral blood. Progression was also observed in lymph node and bone marrow samples (21% with Richter transformation; 33% with findings suggestive of ""accelerated phase"" of chronic lymphocytic leukemia including prominent proliferation centers and/or increased numbers of prolymphocytes). However, the presence of the morphologic features suggestive of ""accelerated phase"" had no effect on overall survival within the chronic lymphocytic leukemia group with TP53 abnormalities (p > 0.05). As previously reported by others, a subset of patients with TP53 alterations were only identified by either PCR mutation analysis (12%) or cytogenetic studies (14%). p53 immunostain positivity was only identified in approximately half of the patients with TP53 alterations identified by either method, and it failed to identify any additional patients with p53 abnormalities. In summary, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with TP53 alterations frequently show atypical morphologic features. Use of multiple modalities to identify p53 abnormalities is recommended to ensure optimal sensitivity and specificity.","['Liu, Yen-Chun', 'Margolskee, Elizabeth', 'Allan, John N', 'Mathew, Susan', 'Bhavsar, Erica', 'Casano, Joseph', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Geyer, Julia T']","['Liu YC', 'Margolskee E', 'Allan JN', 'Mathew S', 'Bhavsar E', 'Casano J', 'Orazi A', 'Furman RR', 'Geyer JT']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8597-0636'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso, TX, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.

We aimed to comprehensively analyze the companion genetic abnormalities and their clinical significance in AML patients with CEBPAdm. By performed targeted amplicon sequencing of 58 genes in specimens at the time of initial diagnosis of 609 AML patients, we identified 76 cases (12.5%) were CEBPAdm, and 88.2% of them also carry other gene mutations. There were more additional gene mutations, especially more epigenetic modifiers gene mutations in CEBPAsm than CEBPAdm cases, while GATA2, CSF3R, JAK3, and KIT mutations were exclusively betide in CEBPAdm but not CEBPAsm. Mutations of tyrosine kinase genes confer to adverse prognostic in karyotype normal CEBPAdm AML and provide potential therapeutic targets. The incidence of germline CEBPA mutation in CEBPAdm cases was 5.3% (4/76), including one C-terminal mutation. Deciphering the mutation spectrum of CEBPAdm AML could facilitate an in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis and refine the prognostic classification of this disease entity.","['Zhang, Yang', 'Wang, Fang', 'Chen, Xue', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Wang, Mingyu', 'Liu, Hong', 'Teng, Wen', 'Cao, Panxiang', 'Nie, Daijing', 'Ma, Xiaoli', 'Wang, Tong', 'Lu, Peihua', 'Liu, Hongxing']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang F', 'Chen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang M', 'Liu H', 'Teng W', 'Cao P', 'Nie D', 'Ma X', 'Wang T', 'Lu P', 'Liu H']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0869-9429'],"['Beijing Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, 100076, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, 100076, China.', 'Beijing Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, 100076, China.', 'Beijing Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, 100076, China. starliu@pku.edu.cn.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, 065201, China. starliu@pku.edu.cn.', 'Divison of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, 100076, China. starliu@pku.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190903,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,,,,2019/09/04 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-019-0133-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-019-0133-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Aug;27(7-8):599-606. doi: 10.1038/s41417-019-0133-7.

We performed a multicenter propensity-matched case-control study to compare HRQOL of newly diagnosed CML patients treated with front-line dasatinib (cases) or imatinib (controls). Patient-reported HRQOL was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-CML24 questionnaires. The impact on daily life scale of the EORTC QLQ-CML24 was selected a priori in the protocol as the primary HRQOL scale for the comparative analysis. Overall, 323 CML patients were enrolled of whom 223 in therapy with imatinib and 100 in therapy with dasatinib. Patients treated with dasatinib reported better disease-specific HRQOL outcomes in impact on daily life (Delta = 8.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.17-14.27, p = 0.002), satisfaction with social life (Delta = 13.45, 95% CI: 5.82-21.08, p = 0.001), and symptom burden (Delta = 7.69, 95% CI: 3.42-11.96, p = 0.001). Analysis by age groups showed that, in patients aged 60 years and over, differences favoring dasatinib were negligible across several cancer generic and disease-specific HRQOL domains. Our findings provide novel comparative HRQOL data that extends knowledge on safety and efficacy of these two TKIs and may help to facilitate first-line treatment decisions.","['Efficace, Fabio', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Cottone, Francesco', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Patriarca, Andrea', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Cascavilla, Nicola', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Efficace F', 'Stagno F', 'Iurlo A', 'Breccia M', 'Cottone F', 'Bonifacio M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Castagnetti F', 'Caocci G', 'Crugnola M', 'Capodanno I', 'Martino B', 'Tiribelli M', 'Patriarca A', 'Gozzini A', 'Pregno P', 'Saussele S', 'Cascavilla N', 'Fozza C', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Binotto G', 'Vignetti M', 'Rosti G']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0716-1686', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5228-6491', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9449-2621']","['Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Rome, Italy. f.efficace@gimema.it.', 'Hematology Section with BMT Unit, AOU Policlinico-V.

MDS are associated with posttranslational modifications of proteins and variations in the protein expression levels. In this work, we present a novel interactomic diagnostic method based on both protein array and surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology, which enables monitoring of protein-protein interactions in a label-free manner. In contrast to conventional methods based on the detection of individual biomarkers, our presented method relies on measuring interactions between arrays of selected proteins and patient plasma. We apply this method to plasma samples obtained from MDS and AML patients, as well as healthy donors, and demonstrate that even a small protein array comprising six selected proteins allows the method to discriminate among different MDS subtypes and healthy donors.","['Chrastinova, Leona', 'Pastva, Ondrej', 'Bockova, Marketa', 'Lynn, Nicholas S', 'Sacha, Pavel', 'Hubalek, Martin', 'Suttnar, Jiri', 'Kotlin, Roman', 'Stikarova, Jana', 'Hlavackova, Alzbeta', 'Pimkova, Kristyna', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Homola, Jiri', 'Dyr, Jan E']","['Chrastinova L', 'Pastva O', 'Bockova M', 'Lynn NS', 'Sacha P', 'Hubalek M', 'Suttnar J', 'Kotlin R', 'Stikarova J', 'Hlavackova A', 'Pimkova K', 'Cermak J', 'Homola J', 'Dyr JE']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. leona.chrastinova@uhkt.cz.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Photonics and Electronics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Photonics and Electronics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Photonics and Electronics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190902,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6718656,,,2019/09/04 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-49084-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-49084-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Sep 2;9(1):12647. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-49084-2.,20201023,12647,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess the evolution of outcomes within donor groups over time and explore whether donor-recipient HLA disparity might be advantageous in patients with aggressive disease. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre study, we assessed the outcomes for adult patients (>/=18 years) with haematological malignancies who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between Jan 3, 2001, and Dec 31, 2015, and were reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The donor types studied were matched sibling, matched unrelated, mismatched unrelated, haploidentical, and cord blood donors. Unrelated non-cord-blood donors and recipients were typed at the allelic level for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. We evaluated trends in overall survival, non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, progression-free survival, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and GVHD-free and relapse-free survival following transplantation from various donor types (matched sibling, matched unrelated, mismatched unrelated, haploidentical, and umbilical cord blood), and compared transplantation outcomes across three epochs (epoch 1: 2001-05; epoch 2: 2006-10; and epoch 3: 2011-15). We used Kaplan-Meier estimators for survival probabilities and cumulative incidence functions accounting for competing risks for probabilities of GHVD, relapse, and non-relapse mortality, using multiple imputations by chained equations to deal with missing data. In epoch 3, we directly compared outcomes by donor group, stratified by a novel three-level disease-risk scheme. FINDINGS: We included 106 188 patients in our analysis. The median follow-up was 4.1 years (IQR 1.7-7.7). Overall survival at 3 years increased with all donor groups between epochs 2 and 3 (matched sibling: 54.0% [95% CI 53.1-54.8] to 54.6% [53.6-55.6]; matched unrelated: 49.1% [48.0-50.2] to 51.6% [50.7-52.6]; mismatched unrelated: 37.4% [35.7-39.2] to 41.3% [39.5-43.1]; haploidentical: 34.5% [31.4-37.9] to 44.2% [42.1-46.3]; and cord blood 36.3% [33.9-39] to 43.7% [40.8-46.8]). Improvement in overall survival seems to be driven by a reduction in non-relapse mortality, except in cord blood HSCT recipients, who had a lower relapse incidence. Comparing donor groups across disease-risk strata using the novel disease-risk scheme, overall survival among recipients of matched sibling transplantations remained better than other donor groups except in high-risk disease, where overall survival with matched unrelated transplantations was not different. INTERPRETATION: Overall survival following allogeneic stem cell transplantation is improving with substantial progress among recipients of haploidentical and cord blood HSCT. Nonetheless, the traditional donor hierarchy of matched sibling donors followed by matched unrelated donors and then other donors holds. Our findings warrant further investigation and could inform decision making and the development of donor-selection algorithms.

Without long-term clinical trial data, current practice to extrapolate survival beyond the trial period involves fitting alternative parametric models to the observed survival. Choosing the most appropriate model is based on how well each model fits to the observed data. Supplementing trial data with feedback from experts may improve the plausibility of survival extrapolations. We demonstrate the feasibility of formally integrating long-term survival estimates from experts with empirical clinical trial data to provide more credible extrapolated survival curves. METHODS: The case study involved relapsed or refractory B-cell pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r pALL) regarding long-term survival for tisagenlecleucel (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell [CAR-T]) with evidence from the phase II ELIANA trial. Seven pediatric oncologists and hematologists experienced with CAR-T therapies were recruited. Relevant evidence regarding r/r pALL and tisagenlecleucel provided a common basis for expert judgments. Survival rates and related uncertainty at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were elicited from experts using a web-based application adapted from Sheffield Elicitation Framework. Estimates from each expert were combined with observed data using time-to-event parametric models that accounted for experts' uncertainty, producing an overall distribution of survival over time. These results were validated based on longer term follow-up (median duration 24.2 months) from ELIANA following the elicitation. RESULTS: Extrapolated survival curves based on ELIANA trial without expert information were highly uncertain, differing substantially depending on the model choice. Survival estimates between 2 to 5 years from individual experts varied with a fair amount of uncertainty. However, incorporating expert estimates improved the precision in the extrapolated survival curves. Predictions from a Gompertz model, which experts believed was most appropriate, suggested that more than half of the ELIANA patients treated with tisagenlecleucel will survive up to 5 years. Expert estimates at 24 months were validated by longer follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an example of how expert opinion can be elicited and synthesized with observed survival data using a transparent and formal procedure, capturing expert uncertainty, and ensuring projected long-term survival is clinically plausible.","['Cope, Shannon', 'Ayers, Dieter', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Batt, Katharine', 'Jansen, Jeroen P']","['Cope S', 'Ayers D', 'Zhang J', 'Batt K', 'Jansen JP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1721-9485'],"['Precision Xtract, 1505 West 2nd Avenue, Suite 300, Vancouver, BC, V6H 3Y4, Canada. shannon.cope@precisionxtract.com.', 'Precision Xtract, 1505 West 2nd Avenue, Suite 300, Vancouver, BC, V6H 3Y4, Canada.', 'Global Oncology Strategy and Business Dev, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 1 Health Plaza, East Hanover, NJ, 07936, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, 1 Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.', 'Precision Xtract, 555 12th Street, Suite 250, Oakland, CA, 94607, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190902,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,PMC6721254,['NOTNLM'],"['*Expert elicitation', '*Leukemia', '*Pediatric', '*Survival', '*Tisagenlecleucel']",2019/09/04 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2017/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12874-019-0823-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12874-019-0823-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2019 Sep 2;19(1):182. doi: 10.1186/s12874-019-0823-8.,20200803,182,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Expert Testimony/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysfunction of the TM causes resistance to outflow of aqueous humor, which in turn leads to elevated IOP, a main risk factor of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Due to variations in IOP, TM cells are continuously exposed to mechanical deformations. We previously reported activation of macroautophagy/autophagy, as one of the physiological responses elicited in TM cells following mechanical strain application. By using biochemical fractionation analysis and imaging techniques, we demonstrate here for the first time the nuclear accumulation of the autophagic marker MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein1 light chain 3)-II, endogenous and exogenously added (AdGFP-LC3, AdtfLC3), in response to cyclic mechanical stress (CMS). Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and leptomycin B treatment suggest LC3 to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion, but to exit in an XPO1/CRM1 (exportin 1)-dependent manner in human TM (hTM) cells. While blockage of nuclear export leads to accumulation of LC3 with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, nuclear LC3 localizes in the nucleolus in cells under CMS. Moreover, nuclear LC3 co-immunoprecipitated with NUFIP1, a ribosome receptor for starvation-induced ribophagy. More interestingly, we further demonstrate that NUFIP1 translocates from the nucleus to LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2)-positive organelles in the stretched cells without triggering ribophagy, suggesting a more general role of NUFIP1 as a selective autophagy receptor for another yet-to-be-identified target in CMS and a surveillance role of nuclear LC3 against stretch-induced damage.

METHODS: The study analyzed 644 untreated CLL patients (pts) using conventional/molecular cytogenetics to reveal the presence of a CK and its composition and to assess its predictive value. The mutational status ofTP53 was detected by next generation sequencing. RESULTS: A CK was detected in 79 pts (12.3%). Patients with a CK showed shorter overall survival (OS) compared to those without a CK (77 months vs. 115 months, p<0.0001). Chromosomes most frequently included in a CK were 13, 11, 17, 8, 2, and 6. The most common aberrations in a CK were translocations, numerical changes and dicentric chromosomes (with no effect on OS). Patients with aberrations ofTP53 and ATM were shown to have adverse prognosis comparable to patients with a CK without these abnormalities. A stronger impact of a CK on OS of female and older CLL patients was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The determining of the presence of a CK is essential in modern clinical CLL practice. According to recent studies, the presence of a CK affects clinical and treatment decision-making.","['Kruzova, Lenka', 'Schneiderova, Petra', 'Holzerova, Milena', 'Vatolikova, Michaela', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Turcsanyi, Peter', 'Urbanova, Renata', 'Kudelka, Milos', 'Radvansky, Martin', 'Kriegova, Eva', 'Papajik, Tomas', 'Urbankova, Helena']","['Kruzova L', 'Schneiderova P', 'Holzerova M', 'Vatolikova M', 'Divoka M', 'Turcsanyi P', 'Urbanova R', 'Kudelka M', 'Radvansky M', 'Kriegova E', 'Papajik T', 'Urbankova H']",,"['Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.

This is particularly the case regarding magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. A major goal of this study is to examine how source of funding influences the reported results and conclusions. Several meta-analyses dating from about 2000 all report significant associations between exposure and risk of leukemia. By examining subsequent reports on childhood leukemia it is clear that almost all government or independent studies find either a statistically significant association between magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia, or an elevated risk of at least OR=1.5, while almost all industry supported studies fail to find any significant or even suggestive association. A secondary goal of this report is to examine the level of evidence for exposure and elevated risk of various adult cancers. Based on pooled or meta-analyses as well as subsequent peer-reviewed studies there is strong evidence that excessive exposure to magnetic fields increases risk of adult leukemia, male and female breast cancer and brain cancer. There is less convincing but suggestive evidence for elevations in several other cancer types. There is less clear evidence for bias based on source of funding in the adult cancer studies. There is also some evidence that both paternal and maternal prenatal exposure to magnetic fields results in an increased risk of leukemia and brain cancer in offspring. When one allows for bias reflected in source of funding, the evidence that magnetic fields increase risk of cancer is neither inconsistent nor inconclusive. Furthermore adults are also at risk, not just children, and there is strong evidence for cancers in addition to leukemia, particularly brain and breast cancer.","['Carpenter, David O']",['Carpenter DO'],,"['Institute for Health and the Environment, University at Albany, A Collaborating Centre of the World Health Organization, 5 University Place, Room A 217, Rensselaer, NY, N 12144, USA.

A pivotal role is played by monocyte recruitment and induction of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which provide immunosuppression and tumorigenesis. The effect of nemorosone, an antiproliferative phytocomponent present in Cuban Propolis, on TAM-induced tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Here we investigated the symbiotic relationship between monocytic leukemia THP-1 and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, and the role of nemorosone in preventing TAM-induced tumor growth. MAIN METHODS: Macrophage differentiation induced by HepG2-conditioned medium was assessed by flow cytometry, analysis of secreted molecules and cytokine expression. The effect of nemorosone and/or conditioned THP-1-medium on HepG2 proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, colony formation, cells cycle and migration assays. KEY FINDINGS: HepG2 cells induced THP-1 recruitment and differentiation to macrophages. When compared with control THP-1 cells, differentiated THP-1 showed a significant increase of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression (P<0.01), and slightly induced HepG2 cells growth. This effect was counteracted by nemorosone, which also significantly inhibited colony formation (P<0.01) and migratory capacity of HepG2 cells, driving a high percentage of cells (80%) to the G0/G1 phase. SIGNIFICANCE: HepG2-conditioned medium is a suitable model for THP-1 modulation and differentiation. Moreover, nemorosone significantly inhibits the proliferation of HepG2 cells, both in presence and absence of the soluble factors secreted by TAMs. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of this natural compound in the HCC-TAM relationship.","['Frion-Herrera, Yahima', 'Gabbia, Daniela', 'Cuesta-Rubio, Osmany', 'De Martin, Sara', 'Carrara, Maria']","['Frion-Herrera Y', 'Gabbia D', 'Cuesta-Rubio O', 'De Martin S', 'Carrara M']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, L.go Meneghetti 2, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, L.go Meneghetti 2, Italy.', 'Chemistry and Health Faculty, Technical University of Machala, Ave. Panamericana Via a Pasaje Km. 5 1/2, Ecuador.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, L.go Meneghetti 2, Italy.

The use of cytostatic drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as adjuvants to cART could be helpful to avoid the reservoir establishment and replenishment. We determined previously that TKI dasatinib, which is successfully used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), shows antiviral effect against HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T cells in vitro. HIV-infected subjects that developed CML may safely combine long-term treatment with TKIs and cART but there is no information about the effect of dasatinib on HIV-1 reservoir in vivo. Therefore, we analyzed the ability of dasatinib to protect NSG mice engrafted with human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells from HIV-1 infection. Mice were randomly assigned to two groups that received dasatinib or placebo daily by oral gavage. After five days, all mice were infected intraperitoneally with HIV-1 and followed up for 21days in the absence of cART. Daily administration of dasatinib decreased viral and proviral load in all treated mice, showing in 40% of these mice undetectable viral RNA or DNA in blood. Proviral HIV-1 DNA in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) was also reduced in all dasatinib-treated mice and under the limit of detection in one of these mice. Finally, treatment with dasatinib modified the distribution of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subpopulations, delaying their differentiation into memory T-cell subsets that are a major component of the viral reservoir.

Anticancer drugs produce huge adverse effects, ultimately leading to death of the patient. Researchers have been focusing on the development of novel molecules with higher efficacy and lower toxicity; the anti-malarial drug artemisinin and its derivatives have exhibited cytotoxic effects. METHODS: We have done extensive literature search for artemisinin for its new role as anti-cancer agent for future treatment. Last two decades papers were referred for deep understanding to strengthen its role. RESULT: Literature shows changes at 9, 10 position in the artemisinin structure produces anticancer activity. Artemisinin shows anticancer activity in leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal and breast cancer cell lines. Artemisinin and its derivatives have been studied as combination therapy with several synthetic compounds, RNA interfaces, recombinant proteins and antibodies etc., for synergizing the effect of these drugs. They produce an anticancer effect by causing cell cycle arrest, regulating signaling in apoptosis, angiogenesis and cytotoxicity activity on the steroid receptors. Many novel formulations of artemisinin are being developed in the form of carbon nanotubes, polymer-coated drug particles, etc., for delivering artemisinin, since it has poor water/ oil solubility and is chemically unstable. CONCLUSION: We have summarize the combination therapies of artemisinin and its derivatives with other anticancer drugs and also focussed on recent developments of different drug delivery systems in the last 10 years. Various reports and clinical trials of artemisinin type drugs indicated selective cytotoxicity along with minimal toxicity thus projecting them as promising anti-cancer agents in future cancer therapies.","['Kumar, Maushmi S', 'Yadav, Tanuja T', 'Khair, Rohan R', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Yergeri, Mayur C']","['Kumar MS', 'Yadav TT', 'Khair RR', 'Peters GJ', 'Yergeri MC']",,"[""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, SVKM'S NMIMS, Vile Parle west, Mumbai-400056, India."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, SVKM'S NMIMS, Vile Parle west, Mumbai-400056, India."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, SVKM'S NMIMS, Vile Parle west, Mumbai-400056, India."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, SVKM'S NMIMS, Vile Parle west, Mumbai-400056, India.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Artemisinin', '*anticancer properties', '*combination therapy', '*formulations', '*reactive oxygen species', '*repurposing.']",2019/09/03 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/09/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPD-EPUB-100596 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612825666190902155957 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2019;25(31):3323-3338. doi: 10.2174/1381612825666190902155957.,20200615,3323-3338,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)']",IM,"['Antimalarials', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Artemisinins/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Nanotubes, Carbon', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of early versus late platelet and neutrophil recovery after induction chemotherapy on survival outcomes of AML patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 181 patients with AML who were treated in our tertiary center between 2001 and 2018 were evaluated. Neutrophil and platelet recovery times were accepted as the periods from the beginning of induction chemotherapy to a neutrophil count of >/=0.5x10(9)/L and a platelet count of >/=20x10(9)/L 3 days in a row, respectively. The median time to platelet recovery was 25 days (range=12-52) for all patients. Therefore, platelet recovery in the first 25 days was defined as early platelet recovery (EPR) and at >/=26 days it was defined as late platelet recovery (LPR). The median time to neutrophil recovery was 28 days (range=13-51) for all patients. Therefore, neutrophil recovery in the first 28 days was defined as early neutrophil recovery, and at >/=29 days it was defined as late neutrophil recovery. Results: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for patients who had EPR and LPR after induction chemotherapy were 62% and 23%, respectively (p<0.001). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for patients who had EPR and LPR after induction chemotherapy were 57% and 15%, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: Short bone marrow recovery time may indicate better healthy hematopoiesis and marrow capacity associated with longer OS and DFS.","['Ciftciler, Rafiye', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C.', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Ozcebe, Osman', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Malkan, Umit Yavuz', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Ciftciler R', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Sayinalp N', 'Ozcebe O', 'Aksu S', 'Demiroglu H', 'Goker H', 'Malkan UY', 'Buyukasik Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5687-8531', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8028-9462', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0359-5148', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1039-7756', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5444-4895']","['Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Diskapi Education and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190902,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,PMC7236414,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Platelet recovery', '*Neutrophil recovery']",2019/09/03 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2019/09/03 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2019.0154 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2020 May 6;37(2):116-120. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2019.0154.

Gene mutation analysis may be more accurate than classical risk factors to pick out these patients before treatment. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of selected genetic mutations in a cohort of patients with high-risk FL. Twenty-five patients with FL refractory to front-line ICT and 10 non-refractory patients matched for age, sex, and FLIPI score were included. We sequenced 18 genes (custom targeted sequencing panel) previously reported to potentially have prognostic impact, including the seven genes necessary to determine m7FLIPI risk. The 35 patients had a median age of 62. The FLIPI and FLIPI2 were high in 27 (84%) and 14 (48%), respectively. Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) and OS probabilities were 25% (95% CI, 13%-41%) and 53% (34%-69%), respectively. There were 73 variants in the 18 genes among the 35 patients. The median number of mutations per patient was 1 (interquartile range, 0-3). The most commonly mutated genes were CREBBP (11 of 35, 31%) and EP300 (10 of 35, 29%). EP300 mutations were associated with refractoriness to treatment (10 of 25 among refractory and 0 of 10 among non-refractory).

Despite medical improvements, mortality in FG is still high. Early diagnosis is very important to reduce additional instrumentations and mortality. In this study, we aimed to present the characteristics of the patients with Fournier's gangrene followed in two centers during ten years period. METHODS: The medical records of patients with FG were reviewed retrospectively. The patient characteristics, causative pathogens, laboratory findings and treatment modalities were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 36 FG cases admitted between January 2008 and February 2018 were included in this study, consisting of 35 male patients, and one female patient with a mean age of 59.27+/-12.91 years. The mean duration of hospital stay was 19+/-10.44 days. The most common predisposing factor was diabetes mellitus, which was found in 28 patients. Malignancy was detected in three patients; prostate cancer in two patients and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia in one patient. Two patients had liver cirrhosis, and one patient had Behcet's disease and psoriasis. The microbiological agent was isolated from a wound culture in nine patients. After urgent surgical debridement, daily dressing with nitrofurazone (Furacin) was done. Additional debridement was conducted when necessary. Orchiectomy was performed in 10 patients; two of them underwent bilateral orchiectomy. One patient died because of sepsis on the seventh day of hospital admission. CONCLUSION: FG is a life-threatening urological emergency with a high mortality rate. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and urgent surgery is pivotal for the prevention of mortality.","['Caliskan, Selahattin', 'Ozsoy, Emrah', 'Sungur, Mustafa', 'Gozdas, Hasan Tahsin']","['Caliskan S', 'Ozsoy E', 'Sungur M', 'Gozdas HT']",,"['Department of Urology, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul-Turkey.', 'Department of Urology, Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul-Turkey.', 'Department of Urology, Hitit University Corum Erol Olcok Training and Research Hospital, Corum-Turkey.', 'Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, Abant Izzet Baysal University Faculty of Medicire, Bolu-Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,101274231,,,,2019/09/03 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/09/03 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14744/tjtes.2019.30232 [doi]'],ppublish,Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg. 2019 Sep;25(5):479-483. doi: 10.14744/tjtes.2019.30232.,20191210,479-483,,,IM,"['Aged', 'Debridement', 'Female', '*Fournier Gangrene', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,Fournier gangreni: Otuz alti olgunun incelenmesi.,,,,,,

Recently, genetic profiling has been fully investigated on ALL; however, the interaction between its genetic alterations and clinical features is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of genetic variants on ALL phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Methods: Targeted exome sequencing technology was used to detect molecular profiling of 140 Chinese pediatric patients with ALL. Correlation of genetic features and clinical outcomes was analyzed. Results: T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients had higher initial white blood cell (WBC) count (34.8x10(9)/L), higher incidence of mediastinal mass (26.9%), more relapse (23.1%), and enriched NOTCH1 (23.1%), FBXW7 (23.1%) and PHF6 (11.5%) mutations. Among the 18 recurrently mutated genes, SETD2 and TP53 mutations occurred more in female patients (P=0.041), NOTCH1 and SETD2 mutants were with higher initial WBC counts (>/=50x10(9)/L) (P=0.047 and P=0.041), JAK1 mutants were with higher minimal residual disease (MRD) level both on day 19 and day 46 (day 19 MRD >/=1%, P=0.039; day 46 MRD >/=0.01%, P=0.031) after induction chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that initial WBC counts (>/=50x10(9)/L), MLLr, and TP53 mutations were independent risk factors for 3-year relapse free survival (RFS) in ALL. Furthermore, TP53 mutations, age (<1 year or >/=10 years), and MLLr were independently associated with adverse outcome in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Conclusions: MLLr and TP53 mutations are powerful predictors for adverse outcome in pediatric B-ALL and ALL.

In addition, SDS patients are predisposed to develop myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), typically during adulthood and associated with TP53 mutations. Although most SDS diagnoses are established in childhood, the nature and frequency of serial bone marrow cell investigations during the patients' lifetime remain a debatable topic. The precise molecular mechanisms leading to AML progression in SDS patients have not been fully elucidated because the patient cohorts are small and most disease monitoring is conducted using standard histological and cytogenetic approaches. Here we report a rare case of a patient with SDS who was diagnosed with AML at 5 years of age and survived. Intermittent neutropenia preceded the AML diagnostic but serial bone marrow monitoring according to the standard of care revealed no cytogenetic anomalies nor signs of clonal hematopoiesis. Using next generation sequencing approaches to find cytogenetically cryptic pathogenic mutations, we identified the cancer hotspot mutation c.394C>T/p.Arg132Cys in IDH1 with high variant allelic frequency in bone marrow cells, suggesting clonal expansion of a major leukemic clone karyotypically normal, in the SDS-associated AML. The mutation was somatic and likely occurred at the leukemic transformation stage, as it was not detected in a matched normal tissue nor in bone marrow smear prior to AML diagnosis. Gain-of-function mutations in IDH1, such as c.394C>T/p.Arg132Cys, create a neo-activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 converting alpha-ketoglutarate into the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, inhibiting alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes, such as histone and DNA demethylases. Overall, our results suggest that along with previously described abnormalities such as TP53 mutations or monosomy7, 7q-, which are all absent in this patient, additional mechanisms including IDH1 mutations drive SDS-related AML and are likely associated with variable outcomes. Sensitive techniques complementary to standard cytogenetics, such as unbiased or targeted panel-based next generation sequencing approaches, warrant testing for monitoring of myelodysplasia, clonal hematopoiesis, and leukemia in the context SDS. Such analyses would also assist treatment decisions and allow to gain insight into the disease biology.","['Mourad, Stephanie', 'Bilodeau, Melanie', 'Roussy, Mathieu', 'Laramee, Louise', 'Boulianne, Luc', 'Rouette, Alexandre', 'Jouan, Loubna', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Duval, Michel', 'Teira, Pierre', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Pastore, Yves', 'Landry, Josette-Renee', 'Cellot, Sonia']","['Mourad S', 'Bilodeau M', 'Roussy M', 'Laramee L', 'Boulianne L', 'Rouette A', 'Jouan L', 'Gendron P', 'Duval M', 'Teira P', 'Hebert J', 'Bittencourt H', 'Pastore Y', 'Landry JR', 'Cellot S']",,"['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Integrated Centre for Pediatric Clinical Genomics, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Integrated Centre for Pediatric Clinical Genomics, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Streamline Genomics, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20190814,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6702516,['NOTNLM'],"['Shwachman-Diamond syndrome', 'cooperating mutation', 'leukemia', 'molecular profiling', 'pediatric patient', 'predisposition syndrome']",2019/09/03 06:00,2019/09/03 06:01,['2019/09/03 06:00'],"['2019/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00772 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Aug 14;9:772. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00772. eCollection 2019.,,772,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection phenotypes can range from asymptomatic to severe adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. HTLV-1, like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), is a blood-borne pathogen and viral infection happens in a similar fashion, with the major mode of transmission through breastfeeding. There is a strong correlation between time of infection and disease development, with a higher incidence of ATLL in patients infected during childhood. There is no successful therapeutic or preventative regimen for HTLV-1. It is therefore essential to develop therapies to inhibit transmission or block the onset/development of HTLV-1 associated diseases. Recently, we have seen the overwhelming success of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) in the treatment of HIV-1. Previously, raltegravir was shown to inhibit HTLV-1 infection. Here, we tested FDA-approved and two Phase II HIV-1 INSTIs in vitro and in a cell-to-cell infection model and show that they are highly active in blocking HTLV-1 infection, with bictegravir (EC50 = 0.30 +/- 0.17 nM) performing best overall. INSTIs, in particular bictegravir, are more potent in blocking HTLV-1 transmission than tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), an RT inhibitor. Our data suggest that HIV-1 INSTIs could present a good clinical strategy in HTLV-1 management and justifies the inclusion of INSTIs in clinical trials.","['Barski, Michal S', 'Minnell, Jordan J', 'Maertens, Goedele N']","['Barski MS', 'Minnell JJ', 'Maertens GN']",,"[""Division of Infectious Diseases, Section of Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Section of Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Section of Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190813,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC6705210,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'INSTI', 'PVL', 'bictegravir', 'elvitegravir', 'integrase', 'raltegravir']",2019/09/03 06:00,2019/09/03 06:01,['2019/09/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.01877 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Aug 13;10:1877. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.01877. eCollection 2019.,,1877,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the defect of mutant SF3B1 is unknown. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from MDS patients and confirmed that SF3B1 mutants use aberrant 3' splice sites. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we purified complexes containing either wild-type or the hotspot K700E mutant SF3B1 and found that levels of a poorly studied spliceosomal protein, SUGP1, were reduced in mutant spliceosomes. Strikingly, SUGP1 knockdown completely recapitulated the splicing errors, whereas SUGP1 overexpression drove the protein, which our data suggest plays an important role in branchsite recognition, into the mutant spliceosome and partially rescued splicing. Other hotspot SF3B1 mutants showed similar altered splicing and diminished interaction with SUGP1. Our study demonstrates that SUGP1 loss is a common defect of spliceosomes with disease-causing SF3B1 mutations and, because this defect can be rescued, suggests possibilities for therapeutic intervention.","['Zhang, Jian', 'Ali, Abdullah M', 'Lieu, Yen K', 'Liu, Zhaoqi', 'Gao, Jianchao', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Raza, Azra', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Manley, James L']","['Zhang J', 'Ali AM', 'Lieu YK', 'Liu Z', 'Gao J', 'Rabadan R', 'Raza A', 'Mukherjee S', 'Manley JL']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.', 'Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Furthermore, we performed serial BM transplantation to demonstrate that the DNA damage-induced expanded FA HSC compartment contained pre-leukemic stem cells that required the NHEJ activity of DNA-PKcs to induce leukemia in the secondary recipients.

In another late B-cell malignancy (multiple myeloma), levels of solubilized B-cell maturation antigen (sBCMA) are elevated and predict outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate sBCMA as a possible prognostic factor and monitoring tool for patients with CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we assessed plasma (p) levels of BCMA in 171 CLL patients and compared them with levels in healthy individuals. RESULTS: pBCMA levels were significantly higher among patients with CLL than those from healthy donors (p < 0.0001). Among patients with aggressive disease, pBCMA was elevated compared with patients with indolent disease (p < 0.001). Those with an initial pBCMA level in the highest quartile had a shorter time to first treatment compared with CLL patients with pBCMA levels in the lowest three quartiles (p < 0.0001). Among those in the highest quartile (pBCMA > 110.9 ng/mL), overall survival was shorter than those in the lowest three quartiles (p = 0.0007). Finally, among those patients who underwent serial pBCMA testing, changes in these levels correlated with changes in their clinical status. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings show that pBCMA is a promising new prognostic and predictive indicator for patients with CLL.","['Udd, Kyle A', 'Bujarski, Sean', 'Wirtschafter, Eric', 'Spektor, Tanya M', 'Ghermezi, Matthew', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'David, Michael E', 'Nosrati, Jason D', 'Rahbari, Ashkon A', 'Wang, James', 'Vardanyan, Suzie', 'Harutyunyan, Nika M', 'Linesch, Julia', 'Li, Mingjie', 'Sanchez, Eric', 'Chen, Haiming', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Berenson, James R']","['Udd KA', 'Bujarski S', 'Wirtschafter E', 'Spektor TM', 'Ghermezi M', 'Rassenti LZ', 'David ME', 'Nosrati JD', 'Rahbari AA', 'Wang J', 'Vardanyan S', 'Harutyunyan NM', 'Linesch J', 'Li M', 'Sanchez E', 'Chen H', 'Kipps TJ', 'Berenson JR']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1587-6104'],"['Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'UCLA-Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, 14445 Olive View Drive, Sylmar, CA, 91342, USA.', 'Oncotherapeutics, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 317, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Oncotherapeutics, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 317, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, 965 Fee Road A110, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA. jberenson@imbcr.org.', 'Oncotherapeutics, 9201 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 317, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, USA. jberenson@imbcr.org.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,,,,2019/09/02 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2019/09/02 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11523-019-00666-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-019-00666-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2019 Oct;14(5):551-561. doi: 10.1007/s11523-019-00666-0.,20200403,551-561,,"['0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Cell Maturation Antigen/*blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time-to-Treatment', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study was conducted on pediatric patients with disseminated T. marneffei infection in a clinical setting. Extracted data included demographic information (age and sex), clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis. Eleven HIV-negative children were enrolled. The male/female ratio was 8:3. The median age of onset was 17.5 months (3.5-84 months). The mortality rate in these children was 36.36% (4/11). Seven children had underlying diseases. All of the children had multiple immunoglobulin abnormalities and immune cell decline. Ten children received voriconazole treatment, and most of the children (7/10) had a complete response to therapy at primary and long-term follow-up assessment; only three children died of talaromycosis. One patient recovered from talaromycosis but died of leukemia. The child who received itraconazole treatment also showed clinical improvement.

Besides, an upregulation of regulatory T cells and inhibitory molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 may have a role as the loss of target by several mechanisms.

Mutations of SF3B1 are commonly seen in myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS)and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN-RS-T). These mutations are typically heterozygous missense substitutions, of which, 55% involve K700E. MDS-RS and MDS/MPN-RS-T usually carry a more favourable prognosis than other subtypes of MDS. SF3B1 itself does not influence survival in these conditions, but does correlate with increased thrombotic risk. Mutated SF3B1 is present in 9%-15% of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cases and on its own correlates with improved responsiveness to ibrutinib, but is associated with additional adverse genetic abnormalities including TP53 and ATM mutations, which traditionally confer adverse outcomes.","['Foy, Allister', 'McMullin, Mary Frances']","['Foy A', 'McMullin MF']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-9894', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0773-0204']","['Haematology, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, Belfast, UK allisterfoy@gmail.com.', 'Haematology, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, Belfast, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190831,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer genetics', 'haematology', 'lymphoma', 'myelodysplasia', 'spliceosomes']",2019/09/02 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/09/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2019-205895 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205895 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2019 Nov;72(11):778-782. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205895.

Targeted RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as a powerful and clinically practical tool, but it depends on expression of RNA transcript from the underlying DNA translocation. Here, we show the clinical utility of nanopore long-read sequencing in rapidly detecting DNA translocation with exact breakpoints. In a newly diagnosed patient with AML, conventional karyotyping showed translocation t(10;12)(q22;p13) but RNA NGS detected NUP98-NSD1 fusion transcripts from a known cryptic translocation t(5;11)(q35;p15). Rapid PCR-free nanopore whole-genome sequencing yielded a 26,194bp sequencing read and revealed the t(10;12) breakpoint to be DUSP13 and GRIN2B in head-to-head configuration. This translocation was then classified as a passenger structural variant. The sequencing also yielded a 20,709bp sequencing read and revealed the t(5;11) breakpoint of the driver NUP98-NSD1 fusion. The identified DNA breakpoints also served as markers for molecular monitoring, in addition to fusion transcript expression by digital PCR and sequence mutations by NGS. We illustrate that third-generation nanopore sequencing is a simple and low-cost workflow for DNA translocation detection.","['Au, Chun Hang', 'Ho, Dona N', 'Ip, Beca B K', 'Wan, Thomas S K', 'Ng, Margaret H L', 'Chiu, Edmond K W', 'Chan, Tsun Leung', 'Ma, Edmond S K']","['Au CH', 'Ho DN', 'Ip BBK', 'Wan TSK', 'Ng MHL', 'Chiu EKW', 'Chan TL', 'Ma ESK']",,"['Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, 1/F Li Shu Fan Block, 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong.

METHODS: An in silico screening was performed using Connectivity Maps to identify FDA-approved drugs that may revert an early leukaemic transformation gene signature. Hit compounds were validated in AML cell lines. Cytotoxic effects were assessed both in primary AML patient samples and healthy donor blood cells. Xenotransplantation assays were undertaken to determine the effect on engraftment of hit compounds. The mechanism of action responsible for the antileukaemic effect was studied focussing on lysosomes and mitochondria. FINDINGS: We identified a group of antihistamines (termed ANHAs) with distinct physicochemical properties associated with their cationic-amphiphilic nature, that selectively killed leukaemic cells. ANHAs behaved as antileukaemic agents against primary AML samples ex vivo, sparing healthy cells. Moreover, ANHAs severely impaired the in vivo leukaemia regeneration capacity. ANHAs' cytotoxicity relied on simultaneous mitochondrial and lysosomal disruption and induction of autophagy and apoptosis. The pharmacological effect was exerted based on their physicochemical properties that permitted the passive targeting of both organelles, without the involvement of active molecular recognition. INTERPRETATION: Dual targeting of lysosomes and mitochondria constitutes a new promising therapeutic approach for leukaemia treatment, supporting the further clinical development.

These variation rates are important to generate hypotheses on causal aetiology. This study aimed to describe incidence and mortality patterns of MM among children, adolescents and young adults (cAYA) in Brazil and to evaluate trends in incidence and mortality rate overtime. METHODS: Data were extracted from a dataset of 15 Population-based Cancer Registries located in five Brazilian geographical regions and calculated by age-specific, crude, and age-standardized incidence (ASR) and mortality rates per million persons. Joinpoint regression analyses were performed for trends evaluations, regionally. Annual Percent Change (APC) and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) were also estimated. RESULTS: The overall ASR for incidence and mortality of MM in Brazil was 14.57 and 8.83 per million, respectively. The AML (non-APL AML and APL) incidence rate is 8.18 per million, whereas other MM subtypes altogether have an incidence rate of 2.62 per million, and not otherwise specified (NOS) is 3.70 per million. The analysis of incidence trends (AAPC) showed a significant decline in Manaus (-5.6%) and Sao Paulo (-4.7%), and a significant increase was observed in Fortaleza (5.8%). Mortality trends steadily declined in all registries, with significant declines occurring in Goiania (-1.5%), Belo Horizonte (-2.3%), Sao Paulo (-2.5%), Curitiba (-2.8%) and Porto Alegre (-4.1%). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed differences in the incidence and mortality rates of MM in cAYA in Brazil, geographically. Infants-AML have the highest incidence within the cAYA population (17.42 per million). There was a substantial decrease in mortality rate observed, which was interpreted as an improvement in MM recognition and therapeutic approach.","['Feliciano, Suellen Valadares Moura', 'Santos, Marceli de Oliveira', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'de Aquino, Josefa Angela Pontes', 'de Aquino, Terezinha Almeida', 'Arregi, Miren Maite Uribe', 'Antoniazzif, Berenice Navarro', 'da Costa, Allini Mafra', 'Formigosa, Lucrecia Aline Cabral', 'Laporte, Cyntia Asturian', 'Lima, Carlos Anselmo', 'Machado, Nayara Cabral', 'de Oliveira, Jose Carlo', ""Pereira, Larissa Dell'Antonio"", 'de Souza, Adriana', 'Dos Santos, Cristina Maria Almeida', 'de Souza, Paulo Cesar Fernandes', 'Venezian, Donaldo Botelho']","['Feliciano SVM', 'Santos MO', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'de Aquino JAP', 'de Aquino TA', 'Arregi MMU', 'Antoniazzif BN', 'da Costa AM', 'Formigosa LAC', 'Laporte CA', 'Lima CA', 'Machado NC', 'de Oliveira JC', 'Pereira LD', 'de Souza A', 'Dos Santos CMA', 'de Souza PCF', 'Venezian DB']",,"['Programa de Hematologia-Oncologia Pediatrica - PHOP, Instituto Nacional de Cancer Jose Alencar Gomes da Silva, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Vigilancia e Analise de Situacao, Coordenacao de Prevencao e Vigilancia, Instituto Nacional de Cancer Jose Alencar Gomes da Silva, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Programa de Hematologia-Oncologia Pediatrica - PHOP, Instituto Nacional de Cancer Jose Alencar Gomes da Silva, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: To build a video decision aid for hospitalized patients with advanced cancer referred for PRT and prospectively test its efficacy in reducing decisional uncertainty, improving knowledge, increasing treatment readiness and readiness for palliative care consultation, and its acceptability among patients. METHODS: Forty patients with advanced cancer hospitalized at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center watched a video decision aid about PRT and palliative care. Patients' conceptual and logistical knowledge of PRT, decisional uncertainty, treatment readiness, and readiness for palliative care consultation were assessed before and after watching the video with a six-item knowledge survey, the decisional uncertainty subscale of the Decisional Conflict Scale, and Likert instruments to assess readiness to accept radiation treatment and/or palliative care consultation, respectively. A postvideo survey assessed the video's acceptability among patients. RESULTS: After watching the video, decisional uncertainty was reduced (28.3 vs. 21.7; P = 0.02), knowledge of PRT improved (60.4 vs. 88.3; P < 0.001), and PRT readiness increased (2.0 vs. 1.3; P = 0.04). Readiness for palliative care consultation was unchanged (P = 0.58). Patients felt very comfortable (70%) watching the video and would highly recommend it (75%) to others. CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, a video decision aid reduced decisional uncertainty, improved knowledge of PRT, increased readiness for PRT, and was well received by patient viewers.","['Dharmarajan, Kavita V', 'Walters, Chasity B', 'Levin, Tomer T', 'Milazzo, Carol Ann', 'Monether, Christopher', 'Rawlins-Duell, Robin', 'Tickoo, Roma', 'Spratt, Daniel E', 'Lovie, Shona', 'Giannantoni-Ibelli, Gina', 'McCormick, Beryl']","['Dharmarajan KV', 'Walters CB', 'Levin TT', 'Milazzo CA', 'Monether C', 'Rawlins-Duell R', 'Tickoo R', 'Spratt DE', 'Lovie S', 'Giannantoni-Ibelli G', 'McCormick B']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA; Brookdale Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

Genomic analysis of peripheral blood DNA has recently identified leukemia-associated genetic mutations within otherwise healthy individuals, an observation that is strongly associated with age. These genetic mutations are often found at high frequency, suggesting dominance of a mutant HSC clone. Expansion of clones carrying other mutations not associated with leukemia or larger chromosomal deletions was also observed. This clinical observation has been termed clonal hematopoiesis, a condition associated with increased risk of both hematological malignancy and cardiovascular disease. Here, we discuss the identification of clonal hematopoiesis and its implications on human health, based on the May 2019 International Society for Experimental Hematology New Investigator Committee Webinar.","['Luis, Tiago C', 'Wilkinson, Adam C', 'Beerman, Isabel', 'Jaiswal, Siddhartha', 'Shlush, Liran I']","['Luis TC', 'Wilkinson AC', 'Beerman I', 'Jaiswal S', 'Shlush LI']",,"['Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Epigenetics and Stem Cell Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD.

LSCs, similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), are those cells that are able to give rise to a new leukemic clone when transplanted into a recipient.

The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved FLT3 inhibitors midostaurin and gilteritinib in FLT3 mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia. Historically, FLT3 was tested by fragment analysis, which has become the standard method endorsed by international guidelines. However, next generation sequencing is increasingly used at acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis given its ability to simultaneously evaluate multiple clinically informative markers. As FLT3-internal tandem duplication detection was known to be challenging by next generation sequencing and the results carry profound prognostic and therapeutic implications, it is important to thoroughly examine its performance in FLT3-internal tandem duplication detection and allelic ratio classification. In a comparative study with fragment analysis, we retrospectively reviewed our experience using a custom-designed, hybridization capture-based, targeted next generation sequencing panel. Among 7902 cases, FLT3-internal tandem duplication was detected in 335 with variable sizes (3-231 bp) and insertion sites. Fragment analysis was also performed in 402 cases, demonstrating 100% concordance in FLT3-internal tandem duplication detection. In 136 dual-tested, positive cases, 128/136 (94%) exhibited concordant high/low allelic ratio classifications. The remaining 6% showed borderline low allelic ratio by next generation sequencing. The two methods were concordant in FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain mutation detection at the hotspot D835/I836 targeted by fragment analysis. Furthermore, seven mutations which may benefit from FLT3 inhibitor therapy were detected by next generation sequencing, in regions not covered by fragment analysis. Our study demonstrates that using a hybridization capture-based chemistry and optimized bioinformatics pipeline, next generation sequencing can reliably detect FLT3-internal tandem duplication and classify its allelic ratio for acute myeloid leukemia risk stratification. Next generation sequencing also exhibits superior comprehensiveness in FLT3 mutation detection and may further improve personalized, targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia.","['He, Rong', 'Devine, Daniel J', 'Tu, Zheng Jin', 'Mai, Ming', 'Chen, Dong', 'Nguyen, Phuong L', 'Oliveira, Jennifer L', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Reichard, Kaaren K', 'Ollila, Paul L', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Alkhateeb, Hassan', 'Viswanatha, David S']","['He R', 'Devine DJ', 'Tu ZJ', 'Mai M', 'Chen D', 'Nguyen PL', 'Oliveira JL', 'Hoyer JD', 'Reichard KK', 'Ollila PL', 'Al-Kali A', 'Tefferi A', 'Begna KH', 'Patnaik MM', 'Alkhateeb H', 'Viswanatha DS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6116-8163'],"['Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.

However, knowledge about how to combine these therapies for optimal effects and what patients will best benefit from them is lacking. Here, we show that drug synergies can be identified by single cell signaling analyses. We investigated the effects of idelalisib, ibrutinib, and venetoclax on 35 protein epitopes by phospho flow in CLL cells. The activity of proteins in the B-cell receptor signalosome and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway were altered upon drug exposure. Combined treatment with ibrutinib and venetoclax give promising results in clinical studies and we show that this combination exerted synergistic inhibitory effects on cell signaling and cell viability. Cell viability was monitored by flow cytometry and with independent drug sensitivity screens. Our analyses indicate that the standard dosages of ibrutinib and venetoclax can be lowered without loss of efficacy, potentially reducing drug costs, and toxicities. Observed correlation between signaling and viability indicates that signaling molecules could serve as biomarkers to predict response to therapy.

The mutant CALR proteins activate the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) inducing cytokine-independent megakaryocyte progenitor proliferation. Here, we generated via CRISPR/Cas9 technology two knock-in mouse models that are heterozygous for a type-I murine Calr mutation. These mice exhibit an ET phenotype with elevated circulating platelets compared with wild-type controls, consistent with our previous results showing that murine CALR mutants activate TpoR. We also show that the mutant CALR proteins can be detected in plasma. The phenotype of Calr del52 is transplantable, and the Calr mutated hematopoietic cells have a slow-rising advantage over wild-type hematopoiesis. Importantly, a homozygous state of a type-1 Calr mutation is lethal at a late embryonic development stage, showing narrowed ventricular myocardium walls, similar to the murine Calr knockout phenotype, pointing to the C terminus of CALR as crucial for heart development.","['Balligand, Thomas', 'Achouri, Younes', 'Pecquet, Christian', 'Gaudray, Gilles', 'Colau, Didier', 'Hug, Eva', 'Rahmani, Yacine', 'Stroobant, Vincent', 'Plo, Isabelle', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Kralovics, Robert', 'Van den Eynde, Benoit J', 'Defour, Jean-Philippe', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N']","['Balligand T', 'Achouri Y', 'Pecquet C', 'Gaudray G', 'Colau D', 'Hug E', 'Rahmani Y', 'Stroobant V', 'Plo I', 'Vainchenker W', 'Kralovics R', 'Van den Eynde BJ', 'Defour JP', 'Constantinescu SN']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-3270', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8599-2699']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, LPAD Unit, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'MyeloPro Research and Diagnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Paris-Saclay, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Mixte de Recherche 1170, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Paris-Saclay, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Mixte de Recherche 1170, Villejuif, France.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Cliniques Universitaires de Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.

The management of these young patients during pregnancy represents a therapeutic dilemma due to the potential teratogen effects of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and is a matter of continuous debate. Indeed, despite the existence of several studies, there is currently no consensus on how to manage different pregnancy situations in subjects with CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe a female patient diagnosed with Ph-positive CML one month after her first delivery who achieved excellent hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses while on imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment. RESULTS: The excellent responses allowed the patient to suspend TKI treatment in order to plan a second pregnancy. Despite IM discontinuation, stringent molecular monitoring of her BCR-ABL1/ABL1 levels allowed the safe delivery of the child and, while the patient eventually developed a molecular relapse after four years of treatment discontinuation, upon restarting IM she quickly regained a deep molecular response that is still ongoing. CONCLUSION: Our case report demonstrates that, if the pregnancy is properly planned in CML patients, it can result in excellent management of the clinical therapeutic option for the benefit of both mother and child.","['Stella, Stefania', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Romano, Chiara', 'DI Gregorio, Sandra', 'Innao, Vanessa', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'DI Raimondo, Francesco', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Manzella, Livia']","['Stella S', 'Tirro E', 'Massimino M', 'Vitale SR', 'Russo S', 'Pennisi MS', 'Puma A', 'Romano C', 'DI Gregorio S', 'Innao V', 'Stagno F', 'DI Raimondo F', 'Musolino C', 'Manzella L']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy stefania.stel@gmail.com.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

It binds to nonmethylated CpG islands through its zinc finger-CxxC DNA binding domain and recruits the complex to target gene loci. Recent studies identified the loss of function mutations in the PRC1.1 gene, BCOR and BCORL1 in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We previously reported that Bcor insufficiency induces T-ALL in mice, supporting a tumor suppressor role for BCOR. However, the function of BCOR responsible for tumor suppression, either its corepressor function for BCL6 or that as a component of PRC1.1, remains unclear. We herein examined mice specifically lacking the zinc finger-CxxC domain of KDM2B in hematopoietic cells. Similar to Bcor-deficient mice, Kdm2b-deficient mice developed lethal T-ALL mostly in a NOTCH1-dependent manner. A chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence analysis of thymocytes revealed the binding of KDM2B at promoter regions, at which BCOR and EZH2 colocalized. KDM2B target genes markedly overlapped with those of NOTCH1 in human T-ALL cells, suggesting that noncanonical PRC1.1 antagonizes NOTCH1-mediated gene activation. KDM2B target genes were expressed at higher levels than the others and were marked with high levels of H2AK119ub1 and H3K4me3, but low levels of H3K27me3, suggesting that KDM2B target genes are transcriptionally active or primed for activation. These results indicate that PRC1.1 plays a key role in restricting excessive transcriptional activation by active NOTCH1, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor in the initiation of T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Isshiki, Yusuke', 'Nakajima-Takagi, Yaeko', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Aoyama, Kazumasa', 'Rizk, Mohamed', 'Kurosawa, Shuhei', 'Saraya, Atsunori', 'Kondo, Takashi', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Yokote, Koutaro', 'Koseki, Haruhiko', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Isshiki Y', 'Nakajima-Takagi Y', 'Oshima M', 'Aoyama K', 'Rizk M', 'Kurosawa S', 'Saraya A', 'Kondo T', 'Sakaida E', 'Nakaseko C', 'Yokote K', 'Koseki H', 'Iwama A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7254-1928', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1175-226X']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Developmental Genetics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, International University of Health and Welfare, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Developmental Genetics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan; and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6737409,,,2019/09/01 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/09/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018028522 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028522 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Sep 10;3(17):2537-2549. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028522.,20200903,2537-2549,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Bcor protein, mouse)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.27 (Kdm2b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*chemistry', 'CpG Islands', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/deficiency/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Domains', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers']",,,,,,,,,,,,

One or more infections occurred in 1045 (59.5%) patients (MAC, 595 [61%]; RIC/NMA, 450 [58%]; P = .21) by day 100. The median time to initial infection after MAC conditioning occurred earlier (MAC, 15 days [range, <1-99 days]; RIC/NMA, 21 days [range, <1-100 days]; P < .001). Patients receiving MAC were more likely to experience at least 1 bacterial infection by day 100 (MAC, 46% [95% confidence interval (CI), 43-49]; RIC/NMA, 37% [95% CI, 34-41]; P = .0004), whereas at least a single viral infection was more prevalent in the RIC/NMA cohort (MAC, 34% [95% CI, 31-37]; RIC/NMA, 39% [95% CI, 36-42]; P = .046). MAC remained a risk factor for bacterial infections in multivariable analysis (relative risk, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23-1.67; P < .0001). Moreover, the rate of any infection per patient-days at risk in the first 100 days (infection density) after alloHCT was greater for the MAC cohort (1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.32; P < .0001). RIC/NMA was associated with reduced infections, especially bacterial infections, in the first 100 days after alloHCT.","['Ustun, Celalettin', 'Kim, Soyoung', 'Chen, Min', 'Beitinjaneh, Amer M', 'Brown, Valerie I', 'Dahi, Parastoo B', 'Daly, Andrew', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Page, Kristin M', 'Papanicolaou, Genovefa', 'Saad, Ayman', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'William, Basem M', 'Wingard, John R', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Auletta, Jeffery J', 'Komanduri, Krishna V', 'Lindemans, Caroline A', 'Riches, Marcie L']","['Ustun C', 'Kim S', 'Chen M', 'Beitinjaneh AM', 'Brown VI', 'Dahi PB', 'Daly A', 'Diaz MA', 'Freytes CO', 'Ganguly S', 'Hashmi S', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Lazarus HM', 'Nishihori T', 'Olsson RF', 'Page KM', 'Papanicolaou G', 'Saad A', 'Seo S', 'William BM', 'Wingard JR', 'Wirk B', 'Yared JA', 'Perales MA', 'Auletta JJ', 'Komanduri KV', 'Lindemans CA', 'Riches ML']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6896-6213', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1404-0575', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2880-6797', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8914-7927', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0478-3340', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1159-5607', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2621-7924', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5970-2128', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0003-0130', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5346-6299', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3715-5236', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0257-0990']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy, Rush University, Chicago, IL.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Miami, Miami, FL.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital and College of Medicine, Hershey, PA."", 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Tom Baker Cancer Center, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Texas Transplant Institute, San Antonio, TX.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Health System, Kansas City, KS.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

We aimed to investigate incidence of and risk factors for end-organ damage resulting in registration on a waiting list for or receiving a solid organ transplantation and 5-year survival following these procedures. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a retrospective cohort of individuals who survived at least 5 years after childhood cancer diagnosed at younger than 21 years of age, between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 1986, at one of 25 institutions in the USA. We linked data from CCSS participants treated in the USA diagnosed between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 1986 (without solid organ transplantation before cohort entry) to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network-a database of all US organ transplants. Eligible participants had been diagnosed with leukaemia, lymphoma, malignant CNS tumours, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumours, and bone and soft tissue sarcomas. The two primary endpoints for each type of organ transplant were date of first registration of a transplant candidate on the waiting list for an organ and the date of the first transplant received. We also calculated the cumulative incidence of being placed on a waiting list or receiving a solid organ transplantation, hazard ratios (HRs) for identified risk factors, and 5-year survival following transplantation. FINDINGS: Of 13 318 eligible survivors, 100 had 103 solid organ transplantations (50 kidney, 37 heart, nine liver, seven lung) and 67 were registered on a waiting list without receiving a transplant (21 kidney, 25 heart, 15 liver, six lung). At 35 years after cancer diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of transplantation or being on a waiting list was 0.54% (95% CI 0.40-0.67) for kidney transplantation, 0.49% (0.36-0.62) for heart, 0.19% (0.10-0.27) for liver, and 0.10% (0.04-0.16) for lung. Risk factors for kidney transplantation were unilateral nephrectomy (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.3-7.7), ifosfamide (24.9, 7.4-83.5), total body irradiation (6.9, 2.3-21.1), and mean kidney radiation of greater than 15 Gy (>15-20 Gy, 3.6 [1.5-8.5]; >20 Gy 4.6 [1.1-19.6]); for heart transplantation, anthracycline and mean heart radiation of greater than 20 Gy (dose-dependent, both p<0.0001); for liver transplantation, dactinomycin (3.8, 1.3-11.3) and methotrexate (3.3, 1.0-10.2); for lung transplantation, carmustine (12.3, 3.1-48.9) and mean lung radiation of greater than 10 Gy (15.6, 2.6-92.7). 5-year overall survival after solid organ transplantation was 93.5% (95% CI 81.0-97.9) for kidney transplantation, 80.6% (63.6-90.3) for heart, 27.8% (4.4-59.1) for liver, and 34.3% (4.8-68.6) for lung. INTERPRETATION: Solid organ transplantation is uncommon in ageing childhood cancer survivors. Organ-specific exposures were associated with increased solid organ transplantation incidence. Survival outcomes showed that solid organ transplantation should be considered for 5-year childhood cancer survivors with severe end-organ failure.

For instance, chronic myeloid leukemia is now well treated with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Around 80% of the patients reach complete remission. However, despite its great efficiency, some patients are resistant to the drug. This heterogeneity in the response might be associated with pharmacokinetic parameters, varying between individuals because of genetic variants. To assess this issue, next-generation sequencing of large panels of genes can be performed from patient samples. However, the common problem in pharmacogenetic studies is the availability of samples, often limited. In the end, large sequencing data are obtained from small sample sizes; therefore, classical statistical analyses cannot be applied to identify interesting targets. To overcome this concern, here, we described original and underused statistical methods to analyze large sequencing data from a restricted number of samples. RESULTS: To evaluate the relevance of our method, 48 genes involved in pharmacokinetics were sequenced by next-generation sequencing from 24 chronic myeloid leukemia patients, either sensitive or resistant to imatinib treatment. Using a graphical representation, from 708 identified polymorphisms, a reduced list of 115 candidates was obtained. Then, by analyzing each gene and the distribution of variant alleles, several candidates were highlighted such as UGT1A9, PTPN22, and ERCC5. These genes were already associated with the transport, the metabolism, and even the sensitivity to imatinib in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: These relevant tests are great alternatives to inferential statistics not applicable to next-generation sequencing experiments performed on small sample sizes. These approaches permit to reduce the number of targets and find good candidates for further treatment sensitivity studies.","['Lichou, Florence', 'Orazio, Sebastien', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Longy, Michel', 'Hubert, Christophe', 'Groppi, Alexis', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Turcq, Beatrice']","['Lichou F', 'Orazio S', 'Dulucq S', 'Etienne G', 'Longy M', 'Hubert C', 'Groppi A', 'Monnereau A', 'Mahon FX', 'Turcq B']",,"['Laboratory of Mammary and Leukaemic Oncogenesis, Inserm U1218 ACTION, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, batiment TP 4eme etage, case 50, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Team EPICENE, Inserm U1219 BPH, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Laboratory of Mammary and Leukaemic Oncogenesis, Inserm U1218 ACTION, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, batiment TP 4eme etage, case 50, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Laboratory of Mammary and Leukaemic Oncogenesis, Inserm U1218 ACTION, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, batiment TP 4eme etage, case 50, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Laboratory of Mammary and Leukaemic Oncogenesis, Inserm U1218 ACTION, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, batiment TP 4eme etage, case 50, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm U1211 MRGM, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'The Bordeaux Bioinformatics Center (CBiB), University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Team EPICENE, Inserm U1219 BPH, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Laboratory of Mammary and Leukaemic Oncogenesis, Inserm U1218 ACTION, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, batiment TP 4eme etage, case 50, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Laboratory of Mammary and Leukaemic Oncogenesis, Inserm U1218 ACTION, Bergonie Cancer Institute, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, batiment TP 4eme etage, case 50, 33076, Bordeaux, France. beatrice.turcq@u-bordeaux.fr.']",['eng'],['PGA120140200913/La Fondation ARC/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190830,England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,PMC6717342,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Factorial correspondence analysis', '*Hierarchical clustering on principal components', '*Next-generation sequencing', '*Pharmacogenetics', '*Rank products', '*Small sample size', '*Statistics']",2019/09/01 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/09/01 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40246-019-0235-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s40246-019-0235-1 [pii]']",epublish,Hum Genomics. 2019 Aug 30;13(1):41. doi: 10.1186/s40246-019-0235-1.,20200317,41,,"['0 (DNA excision repair protein ERCC-5)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (UGT1A9 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 1A9)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN22 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Endonucleases/*genetics', 'Female', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22/*genetics', 'Sample Size', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 1A9', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Penfluridol, a long-acting oral antipsychotic drug, has an outstanding safety record and exerts oncostatic effects on various solid tumors. Until now, the effect of penfluridol on AML remains unknown. METHODS: AML cell lines harboring wild-type (WT) Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and internal tandem duplication (ITD)-mutated FLT3 were used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of penfluridol by an MTS assay. A flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the cell-death phenotype, cell cycle profile, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) formation. Western blotting and chemical inhibitors were used to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in penfluridol-mediated cell death. RESULTS: We observed that penfluridol concentration-dependently suppressed the cell viability of AML cells with FLT3-WT (HL-60 and U937) and FLT3-ITD (MV4-11). We found that penfluridol treatment not only induced apoptosis as evidenced by increases of nuclear fragmentation, the sub-G1 populations, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and caspase-3 activation, but also triggered autophagic responses, such as the light chain 3 (LC3) turnover and AVO formation. Interestingly, blocking autophagy by the pharmacological inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and chloroquine, dramatically enhanced penfluridol-induced apoptosis, indicating the cytoprotective role of autophagy in penfluridol-treated AML cells. Mechanistically, penfluridol-induced apoptosis occurred through activating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to suppress Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities. Moreover, penfluridol's augmentation of intracellular ROS levels was critical for the penfluridol-induced autophagic response. In the clinic, we observed that patients with AML expressing high PP2A had favorable prognoses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a rationale for penfluridol being used as a PP2A activator for AML treatment, and the combination of penfluridol with an autophagy inhibitor may be a novel strategy for AML harboring FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD.","['Wu, Szu-Yuan', 'Wen, Yu-Ching', 'Ku, Chia-Chi', 'Yang, Yi-Chieh', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien']","['Wu SY', 'Wen YC', 'Ku CC', 'Yang YC', 'Chow JM', 'Yang SF', 'Lee WJ', 'Chien MH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0084-7231'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. lwj5905@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. lwj5905@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mhchien1976@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mhchien1976@gmail.com.', 'Pulmonary Research Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mhchien1976@gmail.com.', 'TMU Research Center of Cancer Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mhchien1976@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['108-wf-swf-03/Wan Fang Hospital'],['Journal Article'],20190831,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,PMC6717358,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Akt', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'Penfluridol', 'Protein phosphatase 2 a', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2019/09/01 06:00,2019/12/25 06:00,['2019/09/01 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12929-019-0557-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12929-019-0557-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2019 Aug 31;26(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s12929-019-0557-2.,20191224,63,,"['0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '25TLU22Q8H (Penfluridol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Antipsychotic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Penfluridol/*pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an isomer of retinoic acid involved in the onset of differentiation and apoptosis of a number of normal and cancer cells, functioning as an anti-cancer agent in several neoplasms. Ectopic changes in the expression of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) occur in response to ATRA, leading to phenotypic alterations in neoplastic cell lines. Moreover, the modulation of miRNA patterns upon ATRA-treatment may represent an effective chemopreventive and anti-cancer therapy strategy. The present systematic review was performed to provide an overview of the modulation of ATRA-induced miRNA expression in different types of neoplastic cells and identify the efficacy of intervention factors (i.e., concentration and duration of treatment) and how they influence expression profiles of oncogenesis-targeting miRNAs. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA statement via the US National Library of Medicine MEDLINE/PubMed bibliographic search engine. RESULTS: The search identified 31 experimental studies involving human cell lines from nine different cancer types (neuroblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, glioblastoma, embryonal carcinoma, and colorectal cancer) treated with ATRA at concentrations ranging from 10(- 3) mumol/L to 10(2) mumol mol/L for 24 h to 21 days. CONCLUSION: The concentrations used and the duration of treatment of cancer cells with ATRA varied widely. The presence of ATRA in the culture medium of cancer cells was able to modulate the expression of more than 300 miRNAs, and inhibit invasive behavior and deregulated growth of cancer cells, resulting in total tumor remission in some cases. ATRA may thus be broadly effective for neoplasm treatment and prevention, although these studies may not accurately represent in vivo conditions. Additional studies are required to elucidate ATRA-induced miRNA modulation during neoplasm treatment.","['Lima, Lara', 'de Melo, Thaisa Cristina Tavares', 'Marques, Diego', 'de Araujo, Jessica Nayara Goes', 'Leite, Isabela Samaria Fernandes', 'Alves, Camila Xavier', 'Genre, Julieta', 'Silbiger, Vivian Nogueira']","['Lima L', 'de Melo TCT', 'Marques D', 'de Araujo JNG', 'Leite ISF', 'Alves CX', 'Genre J', 'Silbiger VN']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9252-0278'],"['Postgraduate Program in Nutrition, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Molecular Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Molecular Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Molecular Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Molecular Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Molecular Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Nutrition, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil. viviansilbiger@hotmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Molecular Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil. viviansilbiger@hotmail.com.', 'Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil. viviansilbiger@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Av.

However, no prior research studied this history's actual impact on the survival of CRC. In the paper, we study the effects of having a malignancy preceding CRC diagnosis on its survival outcomes. METHODS: CRC patients diagnosed during 1973-2008 were reviewed using the SEER 18 database. We calculated overall survival and cancer-specific survival of subsequent CRC, and more specifically stage IV CRC, using Kaplan-Meier test and adjusted Cox models. RESULTS: A total 550,325 CRC patients were reviewed, of whom 31,663 had history of a prior malignancy. The most commonly reported sites of a prior malignancy were: prostate, breast, urinary bladder, lung, and endometrium. Patients with history of a prior non-leukemic malignancy or history of a prior leukemia were found to have worse overall survival (HR = 1.165 95%CI = 1.148-1.183, P < 0.001) and (HR = 1.825 95%CI = 1.691-1.970, P < 0.001), respectively. However, CRC patients with history of a prior non-leukemic malignancy showed an improved colorectal cancer-specific survival (HR = .930 95%CI = .909-.952, P < 0.001). Analysis of stage IV CRC patients showed that patients with history of any non-leukemic malignancy did not have a significant change in overall survival. Whereas, patients with a prior leukemia showed a worse overall survival (HR = 1.535, 95%CI = 1.303-1.809, P < 0.001). When analyzed separately, right CRC and left CRC showed similar survival patterns. CONCLUSION: A prior malignancy before CRC -in general- can be associated with worse clinical survival outcomes. These worse outcomes are not observed in stage IV CRC. Considering these results when including/excluding stage IV CRC patients with prior malignancies in clinical trials may play help improve their generalizability.","['Al-Husseini, Muneer J', 'Saad, Anas M', 'Mohamed, Hadeer H', 'Alkhayat, Mohamad A', 'Sonbol, Mohamad Bassam', 'Abdel-Rahman, Omar']","['Al-Husseini MJ', 'Saad AM', 'Mohamed HH', 'Alkhayat MA', 'Sonbol MB', 'Abdel-Rahman O']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0101-0131'],"['Department of Medicine, Ascension St John Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Fayez Mansour Street, Damascus, Syria. anassaad256@gmail.com.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. omar.abdelrhman@med.asu.edu.eg.', 'Clinical Oncology department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Lofty Elsayed Street, Cairo, 11566, Egypt. omar.abdelrhman@med.asu.edu.eg.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190830,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6716811,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical trials', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Eligibility', 'Prior malignancy', 'SEER database', 'Survival analysis']",2019/09/01 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/09/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6074-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6074-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Aug 30;19(1):863. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6074-6.,20200121,863,,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*mortality/*pathology', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Selection', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to examine Candida colonization status and corresponding current changes in children with malignancy during repeated admissions and also investigate the possible epidemiological shifts after the implementation of ASP. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, all eligible patients younger than 18 years were recruited during 2016-2017 at Amir Medical Oncology Center (AMOC) in Shiraz, Iran. Totally, 136 patients were enrolled and 482 samples were collected from different sites (oral/nasal discharges, urine and stool). Weekly regular sampling was carried out during hospitalization. Candida colonization status and epidemiological changes were monitored during repeated admissions. Samples were cultivated on Sabouraud Dextrose agar medium and identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Estimated Candida colonization incidence was 59.9% (82/136) in our patients. Candida colonization was found to be higher in oral cavity and rectum than that in nasal cavity. Among those long-term follow ups and repetitive hospitalizations, a significant number of patients exhibited changes in their colonization patterns (37.7%). Candida colonization did not reveal any significant relationship with age, sex, oncologic diseases and degree of neutropenia. C. albicans (72.0%) was found as the most common Candida species in colonized patients, followed by C. krusei, C. kefyr, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence of Candida infections in children with cancers, close monitoring of epidemiologic changes is essential for judicious management, based on local surveillance data and improvement of overall quality of care in high risk patients.","['Hamzavi, Seyedeh Sedigheh', 'Amanati, Ali', 'Badiee, Parisa', 'Kadivar, Mohammad Rahim', 'Jafarian, Hadis', 'Ghasemi, Fatemeh', 'Haghpanah, Sezaneh', 'Dehghani, Mansooreh', 'Norouzian Baghani, Abbas']","['Hamzavi SS', 'Amanati A', 'Badiee P', 'Kadivar MR', 'Jafarian H', 'Ghasemi F', 'Haghpanah S', 'Dehghani M', 'Norouzian Baghani A']",,"['Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. amanati@sums.ac.ir.', 'Head of Infection Control Unit, Amir Medical Oncology Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. amanati@sums.ac.ir.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190830,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC6717378,['NOTNLM'],"['Candida albicans', 'Fungal colonization', 'Pediatric leukemia']",2019/09/01 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2019/09/01 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-019-4372-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-019-4372-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Aug 30;19(1):759. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4372-x.,20191114,759,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Candida/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology/therapy', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mouth/microbiology', 'Nose/microbiology', '*Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rectum/microbiology', 'Recurrence']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now widely accepted that curative therapies must have the potential to eliminate or completely suppress LSC, as only these cells can restore and propagate the malignancy for unlimited time periods. Since LSC represent a minor cell fraction in the leukemic clone, little is known about their properties and target expression profiles. Over the past few years, several cell-specific immunotherapy concepts have been developed, including new generations of cell-targeting antibodies, antibody-toxin conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T cell-based strategies. Whereas such concepts have been translated and may improve outcomes of therapy in certain lymphoid neoplasms and a few other malignancies, only little is known about immunological targets that are clinically relevant and can be employed to establish such therapies in myeloid neoplasms. In the current article, we provide an overview of the immunologically relevant molecular targets expressed on LSC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In addition, we discuss the current status of antibody-based therapies in these malignancies, their mode of action, and successful examples from the field.","['Valent, Peter', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Bauer, Karin', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Schulenburg, Axel', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Wolf, Dominik']","['Valent P', 'Sadovnik I', 'Eisenwort G', 'Bauer K', 'Herrmann H', 'Gleixner KV', 'Schulenburg A', 'Rabitsch W', 'Sperr WR', 'Wolf D']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0456-5095', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2735-4645']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology & Oncology), Medical University of Innsbruck, 1090 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical Clinic 3, Oncology, Hematology, Immunoncology & Rheumatology, University Clinic Bonn (UKB), 53127 Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190829,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6747233,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CAR-T cell therapy', 'CML', 'bispecific antibodies', 'leukemic stem cells', 'precision medicine']",2019/09/01 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/09/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20174233 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20174233 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Aug 29;20(17). pii: ijms20174233. doi: 10.3390/ijms20174233.,20200203,,,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'B7-H1 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods/trends', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-microbial and anti-tumor naphthoquinones fusarubin (FUS) and anhydrofusarubin (AFU) were isolated using column chromatography from a Cladosporium species residing inside Rauwolfia leaves. The impact of FUS and AFU on cell growth was assessed in acute myeloid leukemia (OCI-AML3) and other hematologic tumor cell lines (HL-60, U937, and Jurkat). Treatment with FUS or AFU reduced the number of OCI-AML3 cells as evaluated by a hemocytometer. Flow cytometry analyses showed that this effect was accompanied by diverse impairments in cell cycle progression. Specifically, FUS (20 or 10 mug/mL significantly decreased the percentage of cells in S phase and increased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase, whereas AFU increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase (50 and 25 mug/mL) and decreased the percentage of cells in S (50 mug/mL) and G2/M (50 and 25 mug/mL) phases. Both substances significantly increased apoptosis at higher concentrations. The effects of FUS were more potent than those of AFU, with FUS up-regulating p21 expression in a p53-dependent manner, as detected by Western blot analyses, likely the consequence of decreased ERK phosphorylation and increased p38 expression (both of which increase p21 stability). FUS also decreased Akt phosphorylation and resulted in increased Fas ligand production and caspase-8/3-dependent apoptosis.

One particular comorbidity of DS is transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), a disease characterized by leukocytosis with elevated blast counts. Approximately 10 percent of DS infants develop TMD, which usually manifests during the first week of life and can lead to an extended hospitalization in a NICU. In addition to hallmark hematologic findings, other manifestations include jaundice, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and pericardial or pleural effusions. TMD generally resolves spontaneously in the first three months of life with the provision of timely medical management; however, survivors are at increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Neonatal nurses need to have knowledge of this disorder to facilitate screening of DS infants and optimize family education and coordination of care.","['Gallaway, Larissa', 'Jnah, Amy J']","['Gallaway L', 'Jnah AJ']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8807-9902'],,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190520,United States,Neonatal Netw,Neonatal network : NN,8503921,,['NOTNLM'],"['AMKL', 'Down syndrome', 'ERG', 'GATA-1', 'TMD', 'genetics', 'leukemia']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['38/3/144 [pii]', '10.1891/0730-0832.38.3.144 [doi]']",ppublish,Neonatal Netw. 2019 May 1;38(3):144-150. doi: 10.1891/0730-0832.38.3.144.

The 3 + 7 regimen is the backbone of standard first-line induction therapy among young/fit patients. However, in elderly and/or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML, who cannot receive intensive chemotherapy, low-dose cytarabine or hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) are the treatment options, which generally cannot induce durable responses. Among young/fit patients, for high-risk disease in first remission, or in cases with relapsed/refractory AML, allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be performed when complete remission is achieved. However, since AML is primarily a disease of the elderly, neither intensive chemotherapy nor allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be generally tolerated in most cases. There is clearly a need for new treatment options in elderly and young/unfit patients who cannot receive intensive chemotherapy. The discovery of novel molecular genetic markers (e.g. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2) resulted in the development of new therapeutic options in AML. This review mainly focuses on 4 targeted therapy agents; glasdegib and venetoclax used in combination treatment with low-dose cytarabine or hypomethylating agents among newly diagnosed cases with AML; and ivosidenib and gilteritinib as monotherapy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML, which were all approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018.","['Kucukyurt, Selin', 'Eskazan, Ahmet Emre']","['Kucukyurt S', 'Eskazan AE']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9568-0894'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191213,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,PMC6955409,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*gilteritinib', '*glasdegib', '*ivosidenib', '*venetoclax']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14105 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Dec;85(12):2689-2693. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14105.

While deep sequencing uncovers rare tumor variants, the heterogeneity of the disease confounds the best of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here we set out to answer if the dark-matter of the genome encompass signals that can distinguish the fine subtypes of disease that are otherwise genomically indistinguishable. We introduce a novel stochastic regularization, ReVeaL, that empowers ML to discriminate subtle cancer subtypes even from the same 'cell of origin'. Analogous to heritability, implicitly defined on whole genome, we use predictability (F1 score) definable on portions of the genome. In an effort to distinguish cancer subtypes using dark-matter DNA, we applied ReVeaL to a new WGS dataset from 727 patient samples with seven forms of hematological cancers and assessed the predictivity over several genomic regions including genic, non-dark, non-coding, non-genic, and dark. ReVeaL enabled improved discrimination of cancer subtypes for all segments of the genome. The non-genic, non-coding and dark-matter had the highest F1 scores, with dark-matter having the highest level of predictability. Based on ReVeaL's predictability of different genomic regions, dark-matter contains enough signal to significantly discriminate fine subtypes of disease. Hence, the agglomeration of rare variants, even in the hitherto unannotated and ill-understood regions of the genome, may play a substantial role in the disease etiology and deserve much more attention.","['Parida, Laxmi', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Rhrissorrakrai, Kahn', 'Utro, Filippo', 'Levovitz, Chaya', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Twardziok, Sven', 'Hutter, Stephan', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Walter, Wencke', 'Baer, Constance', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Parida L', 'Haferlach C', 'Rhrissorrakrai K', 'Utro F', 'Levovitz C', 'Kern W', 'Nadarajah N', 'Twardziok S', 'Hutter S', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Walter W', 'Baer C', 'Haferlach T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7872-5074', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1567-9090', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3226-7642', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6486-9675']","['IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, United States of America.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, United States of America.', 'IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, United States of America.', 'IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, United States of America.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190830,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,PMC6742441,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2020/01/21 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007332 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-18-01941 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2019 Aug 30;15(8):e1007332. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007332. eCollection 2019 Aug.,20200120,e1007332,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genome, Human', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', '*Models, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates of organ dose to the developing fetus allow for the development of dose-dependent and gestational age-dependent models of deterministic (e.g., organ malformation) and stochastic (e.g., leukemia) risk of in utero exposure. To date, both the 1986 and 2002 dosimetry systems at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation have utilized the uterine wall in the non-pregnant adult female as a dose surrogate for individual fetal organs and tissues. Here we present a new J45 (Japanese 1945) series of high-resolution phantoms of the adult pregnant female at 8-, 15-, 25- and 38-weeks post-conception. These models, which were derived from the University of Florida (UF) series of ICRP Publication 89 compliant reference phantoms, have been rescaled to approximate the pregnant mother using 1945 Japanese morphometry data. Fetal and maternal organ doses were estimated by computationally exposing the pregnant female phantom series to DS02 free-in-air photon and neutron fluences at three distances from the hypocenter at both Hiroshima and Nagasaki under frontal (AP) and isotropic (ISO) particle incidence. As for the fetal organ doses, our results indicate that the uterine wall of the non-pregnant female generally underestimates fetal organ dose within the pregnant female. The magnitude of these differences varies with both radiation type and irradiation geometry, with the smallest differences (5-7%) seen for ISO photon fields and the largest differences (20-30%) seen for AP neutron fields. Significant discrepancies were seen in fetal brain dose and its uterine wall surrogate, particularly for photon AP fields (ratio of uterine wall to brain dose varied from 0.9 to 1.3) and neutron AP fields (dose ratios from 0.75 to 2.0). As for the maternal organ doses, the use of organ doses in a non-pregnant female was shown, in general, to overestimate the corresponding organ doses in the pregnant female, with greater deviations seen at later stages of pregnancy (12-16% for AP photons and 44-53% for AP neutrons). The one exception was the uterine wall dose in pregnancy which was seen to be underestimated by that in the non-pregnant female phantom, particularly for ISO and AP neutron fields. These results demonstrate that the J45 pregnant female phantom series offers the opportunity for significant improvements in both fetal and maternal organ dose assessment within this unique cohort of the atomic bomb survivors.","['Paulbeck, Colin', 'Griffin, Keith', 'Lee, Choonsik', 'Cullings, Harry', 'Egbert, Stephen D', 'Funamoto, Sachiyo', 'Sato, Tatsuhiko', 'Endo, Akira', 'Hertel, Nolan', 'Bolch, Wesley E']","['Paulbeck C', 'Griffin K', 'Lee C', 'Cullings H', 'Egbert SD', 'Funamoto S', 'Sato T', 'Endo A', 'Hertel N', 'Bolch WE']",,"['Medical Physics Program, College of Medicine.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of San Diego, California.', 'Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai-mura, Japan.', 'Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai-mura, Japan.', 'Department of George W.

Blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) is recommended for relapsed/refractory NHL, and the risk of VTE after these patients undergo BMT is uncertain. METHODS: Patients with NHL who survived 2 years or longer after BMT were surveyed for long-term health outcomes, including VTE. The median follow-up was 8.1 years (interquartile range, 5.6-12.9 years). The risk of VTE in 734 patients with NHL versus 897 siblings without a history of cancer and the risk factors associated with VTE were analyzed. RESULTS: BMT survivors of NHL were at increased risk for VTE in comparison with siblings (odds ratio for allogeneic BMT survivors, 4.61; P < .0001; odds ratio for autologous BMT survivors, 1.75; P = .035). The cumulative incidence of VTE was 6.3% +/- 0.9% at 5 years after BMT and 8.1% +/- 1.1% at 10 years after BMT. In allogeneic BMT recipients, an increased body mass index (BMI; hazard ratio [HR] for BMI of 25-30 kg/m(2) , 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-8.64; P = .006; HR for BMI > 30 kg/m(2) , 3.44; 95% CI, 1.15-10.23; P = .027) and a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.59-6.97; P = .001) were associated with an increased risk of VTE. Among autologous BMT recipients, a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (HR, 5.94; 95% CI, 1.7-20.71; P = .005) and prior treatment with carmustine (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.66-14.51; P = .004) were associated with increased VTE risk. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NHL who survive BMT are at risk for developing late occurring VTE, and ongoing vigilance for this complication is required. Future studies assessing the role of thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients with NHL are needed.","['Gangaraju, Radhika', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Hageman, Lindsey', 'Wu, Jessica', 'Francisco, Liton', 'Kung, Michelle', 'Ness, Emily', 'Parman, Mariel', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Armenian, Saro H', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Gangaraju R', 'Chen Y', 'Hageman L', 'Wu J', 'Francisco L', 'Kung M', 'Ness E', 'Parman M', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Forman SJ', 'Arora M', 'Armenian SH', 'Bhatia S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5542-4754', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2604-8603', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7755-5683']","['University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA078938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA213140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R6502-16/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190830,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC6891120,['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation', '*autologous blood or marrow transplantation', '*blood or marrow transplantation survivors', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*venous thromboembolism']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32488 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Dec 15;125(24):4498-4508. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32488.

Early attention to symptoms of depression may help to prevent the development of a more serious depression over time. Aims: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence, assess severity and identify determinants of depressive disorder among caregivers of children with leukaemia in Baghdad, Iraq, 2014. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of caregivers of 250 leukaemia children aged <15 years admitted to Child Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq. Socio-demographic variables were collected and the presence of depressive disorder was assessed using the Arabic Version of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II); those with a score of >16 were considered depressed. Results: The prevalence of depression was 72% (95% CI: 66-77.5%); classified to 18.9% having borderline clinical depression, 36.7% moderate depression, 27.8% severe depression and 16.7% extreme depression. Presence of depression was significantly higher among younger age caregivers, disease duration of >12 months and frequent hospital admission. Conclusions: The high prevalence of depression among care givers of leukaemia patients urge health care professionals to pay more attention to the psychological aspects of the families of leukaemia patients and ensure referring them for psychiatric support.","['Lutfi, Noor Mohammed', 'Al Lami, Faris']","['Lutfi NM', 'Al Lami F']",,"['Ministry of Health, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'College of Medicine, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190819,Egypt,East Mediterr Health J,Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,9608387,,['NOTNLM'],"['Iraq', 'caregivers', 'depressive disorders', 'determinants', 'leukaemia']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2015/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26719/emhj.19.005 [doi]'],epublish,East Mediterr Health J. 2019 Aug 19;25(6):385-393. doi: 10.26719/emhj.19.005.,20200318,385-393,"['Copyright (c) World Health Organization (WHO) 2019.

This article examines the role of the registered children's nurse in meeting the psychosocial needs of adolescents and their families during a diagnosis of ALL. The psychosocial needs considered in this article include those for information, emotional support, collaborative decision-making, education and socialisation.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used to treat CML patients, but these have limited efficacy due to the emergence of resistance via genetic mutation. Kamebakaurin is an ent-kaurane diterpenoid that has been isolated from Rabdosia excisa (Maxim.) H.Hara. Herein, we investigate the potential of kamebakaurin as a chemotherapy reagent for the treatment of CML. We conducted in vitro and in vivo biological experiments and found that kamebakaurin potently inhibits cell proliferation, mainly by enhancing cell apoptosis and down-regulating Bcr-Abl protein levels. In addition, kamebakaurin was found to inhibit tumor growth and has no side effects on five internal organs for in vivo experiment. These results suggest that kamebakaurin is a potential anticancer agent and is a key compound for further investigations.","['Xia, Yan', 'Feng, Miao', 'Wang, Erkang', 'Chen, Li', 'Wang, Jin', 'Hou, Ruibin', 'Zhao, Yinping']","['Xia Y', 'Feng M', 'Wang E', 'Chen L', 'Wang J', 'Hou R', 'Zhao Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6764-3308'],"['College of Chemistry and Life Science, Changchun University of Technology, Changchun, 130012, P.

This phase II study explored the benefit of adding pracinostat to HMAs in MDS patients who did not respond to single-agent HMA treatment. The goal was to estimate the clinical improvement rate [complete remission (CR), marrow CR, partial response (PR) and haematological improvement]. Group 1 included patients with primary/secondary HMA failures; Group 2 included those who did not achieve response but had stable disease (SD) after single-agent HMAs. Forty-five patients (39 Group 1, 6 Group 2) received a median of 3 cycles. Among all patients, 1 (2%) had CR, 7 (16%) had marrow CR and 18 (40%) had SD; disease progression occurred in 3 (7%). Median overall survival was 5.7/5.6 months for Group 1/2. Grade >/=3 adverse events occurred in 38 patients (84%) leading to treatment discontinuation in 12 (33%). Adding pracinostat to HMAs did not improve outcomes in patients previously treated with HMAs. Frequent dose modifications/early discontinuation resulted in suboptimal drug exposure.

Knockdown of TauT expression by RNAi resulted in cell cycle G2 arrest and suppressed human breast cancer MCF-7 cells proliferation determined by colonies production and cell migration assays. Knockdown of TauT also rendered MCF-7 cells more susceptible to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. An antibody specifically against TauT blocked taurine uptake and induced cell cycle G2 arrest leading to cell death of variety type of tumor cells without affecting the viability of normal mammalian cells. TauT peptide vaccination significantly increased median lifespan (1.5-fold) of the p53 null mice and rescued p53+/- mice by extending the median lifespan from 315 days to 621 days. Furthermore, single dose treatment of tumor-bearing (thymic lymphoma) p53 null mice with TauT peptide reduced tumor size by about 50% and significantly prolonged survival of these mice from average 7 days (after observing the thymic lymphoma) to 21 days. This finding demonstrates that a novel TauT peptide vaccine can delay, inhibit, and/or treat p53 mutation related spontaneous tumorigenesis in vivo. Therefore, TauT peptide may be used as a universal cancer vaccine to prevent and/or treat patients with p53 mutation-mediated cancers.","['Han, Xiaobin']",['Han X'],,"['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA. xhan@uthsc.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer immunotherapy', 'TauT', 'TauT peptide', 'p53']",2019/08/31 06:00,2019/09/20 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-8023-5_50 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1155:543-553. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-8023-5_50.,20190919,543-553,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '148686-53-7 (taurine transporter)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, jun', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'MCF-7 Cells', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', '*RNA Interference', 'Taurine', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Vaccines, Subunit']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gain-of-function mutations of the CCR4 gene in ATL patients may be associated with alterations at the carboxyl terminus, a finding which led to a high efficacy anti-CCR4 antibody, mogamulizumab. Only a few studies have reported CCR4 protein expression and genomic CCR4 mutations in non-ATL T/NK-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, an association between CCR4 protein expression, genomic CCR4 mutations, and transcript CCR4 mutations has not been well analyzed. The T/NK-cell lymphomas (n = 226) enrolled in this study were examined for CCR4 expression by immunohistochemistry. CCR4 mutations in the codons 322-348 were detected by direct sequencing and a SNaPshot Multiplex assay. CCR4 protein expression was positive in 48/52 (92%) and 58/174 (33%) of ATL and non-ATL cases, respectively, and genomic CCR4 mutations were detected in 17/52 (33%) and 6/174 (3.4%), respectively. While all 17 ATL cases with genomic CCR4 mutations were positive for CCR4 protein expression, five of six mutated non-ATL cases were negative for CCR4 protein expression and transcript CCR4 mutations. This study suggests that frequencies of CCR4 expression and genomic CCR4 mutations and an association between the two may be considerably different between ATL cases and non-ATL T/NK-cell lymphomas.","['Sakamoto, Yuma', 'Fujii, Keiichiro', 'Murase, Shunji', 'Nakano, Satsuki', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Murase, Takayuki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi']","['Sakamoto Y', 'Fujii K', 'Murase S', 'Nakano S', 'Masaki A', 'Murase T', 'Kusumoto S', 'Iida S', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ueda R', 'Ishida T', 'Inagaki H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9916-4862'],"['Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan. hinagaki@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['16H04713/scientific research (B)', '17ck0106287h0001/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '16cm0106301h0001/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '15ck0106132h0002/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development']",['Journal Article'],20190829,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'CCR4', 'Mogamulizumab', 'T/NK-cell lymphomas']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02728-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02728-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Oct;110(4):389-392. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02728-5.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared outcomes of patients who received a first alloHCST after non-myeloablative (NMA) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Data of 432 patients with a median age of 55 years were included, of which 86 patients underwent NMA and 346 RIC. RESULTS: The median follow-up after alloHSCT was 4.3 years. Compared to the RIC group, more NMA patients had purine-analog-sensitive disease, were in complete remission and received matched related donor transplantation. After RIC, the probabilities for 5-year OS, EFS, CIR, and NRM were 46%, 38%, 28%, and 35% and after NMA the respective probabilities were 52%, 43%, 25%, and 32%. In multivariate analysis, remission status prior to conditioning but not RIC versus NMA conditioning had a significant impact on CIR, EFS, and OS. CONCLUSION: Presumed higher anti-leukemic activity of RIC versus NMA conditioning did not translate into better outcomes after alloHSCT, but better remission status prior to conditioning did. Effective pathway inhibitor-based salvage therapies combined with NMA conditioning might thus represent the most attractive contemporary approach for alloHSCT for patients with CLL.","['Andersen, Niels Smedegaard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Vitek, Antonin', 'Karas, Michal', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Moreno, Carol', 'van Gelder, Michel', 'Henseler, Anja', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'Schonland, Stefan', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Schetelig, Johannes']","['Andersen NS', 'Bornhauser M', 'Gramatzki M', 'Dreger P', 'Vitek A', 'Karas M', 'Michallet M', 'Moreno C', 'van Gelder M', 'Henseler A', 'de Wreede LC', 'Schonland S', 'Kroger N', 'Schetelig J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2780-2981'],"['BMT Unit Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS gGmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik u.

On the one hand, a number of mutations were discovered and associated with AML diagnosis and prognosis; some of them were introduced into diagnostic tests. On the other hand, transcriptome studies, which preceded AML exome and genome sequencing, remained poorly translated into clinics. Nevertheless, gene expression studies significantly contributed to the elucidation of AML pathogenesis and indicated potential therapeutic directions. The power of transcriptomic approach lies in its comprehensiveness; we can observe how genome manifests its function in a particular type of cells and follow many genes in one test. Moreover, gene expression measurement can be combined with mutation detection, as high-impact mutations are often present in transcripts. This review sums up 20 years of transcriptome research devoted to AML. Gene expression profiling (GEP) revealed signatures distinctive for selected AML subtypes and uncovered the additional within-subtype heterogeneity. The results were particularly valuable in the case of AML with normal karyotype which concerns up to 50% of AML cases. With the use of GEP, new classes of the disease were identified and prognostic predictors were proposed. A plenty of genes were detected as overexpressed in AML when compared to healthy control, including KIT, BAALC, ERG, MN1, CDX2, WT1, PRAME, and HOX genes. High expression of these genes constitutes usually an unfavorable prognostic factor. Upregulation of FLT3 and NPM1 genes, independent on their mutation status, was also reported in AML and correlated with poor outcome. However, transcriptome is not limited to the protein-coding genes; other types of RNA molecules exist in a cell and regulate genome function. It was shown that microRNA (miRNA) profiles differentiated AML groups and predicted outcome not worse than protein-coding gene profiles. For example, upregulation of miR-10a, miR-10b, and miR-196b and downregulation of miR-192 were found as typical of AML with NPM1 mutation whereas overexpression of miR-155 was associated with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). Development of high-throughput technologies and microarray replacement by next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) enabled uncovering a real variety of leukemic cell transcriptomes, reflected by gene fusions, chimeric RNAs, alternatively spliced transcripts, miRNAs, piRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and their special type, circular RNAs. Many of them can be considered as AML biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. The relations between particular RNA puzzles and other components of leukemic cells and their microenvironment, such as exosomes, are now under investigation. Hopefully, the results of this research will shed the light on these aspects of AML pathogenesis which are still not completely understood.","['Handschuh, Luiza']",['Handschuh L'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9803-6877'],"['Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190730,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,PMC6699387,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2019/08/31 06:01,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/7239206 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 Jul 30;2019:7239206. doi: 10.1155/2019/7239206. eCollection 2019.,,7239206,,,,,['The author declares that she has no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the WT1 gene and NUP98-NSD1 fusion are predictors of poor survival outcome/prognosis that frequently occur in combination with internal tandem duplications of the juxta-membrane domain of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD). To re-evaluate the effect of these factors in contemporary protocols, 353 patients (<18 years) treated in Germany with AML-BFM treatment protocols between 2004 and 2017 were included. Presence of mutated WT1 and FLT3-ITD in blasts (n=19) resulted in low 3-year event-free survival of 29% and overall survival of 33% compared to rates of 45-63% and 67-87% in patients with only one (only FLT3-ITD; n=33, only WT1 mutation; n=29) or none of these mutations (n=272). Including NUP98-NSD1 and high allelic ratio (AR) of FLT3-ITD (AR >/=0.4) in the analysis revealed very poor outcomes for patients with co-occurrence of all three factors or any of double combinations. All these patients (n=15) experienced events and the probability of overall survival was low (27%). We conclude that co-occurrence of WT1 mutation, NUP98-NSD1, and FLT3-ITD with an AR >/=0.4 as triple or double mutations still predicts dismal response to contemporary first- and second-line treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.","['Niktoreh, Naghmeh', 'Walter, Christiane', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'von Neuhoff, Christine', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Rasche, Mareike', 'Waack, Katharina', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Hanenberg, Helmut', 'Reinhardt, Dirk']","['Niktoreh N', 'Walter C', 'Zimmermann M', 'von Neuhoff C', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Rasche M', 'Waack K', 'Creutzig U', 'Hanenberg H', 'Reinhardt D']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5032-4789', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0451-2735', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7027-4483']","[""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, LVR Klinikum Essen, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany."", 'Centre for Research Acceleration in Pediatrics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany."", 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology & Head/Neck Surgery, Heinrich Heine University, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190730,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,PMC6699323,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2019/08/31 06:01,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1609128 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 Jul 30;2019:1609128. doi: 10.1155/2019/1609128. eCollection 2019.,,1609128,,,,,"['The authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the current work.

MCL1 is a fast-turnover protein that is degraded via an ubiquitination/proteasome-dependent mechanism. Although several E3 ligases have been discovered to promote the ubiquitination of MCL1, the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that regulates its stability requires further investigation. Methods: The immunoprecipitation was used to determine the interaction between OTUD1 and MCL1. The ubiquitination assays was performed to determine the regulation of MCL1 by OTUD1. The cell viability was used to determine the regulation of BH3-mimetic inhibitor induced cell death by OTUD1. The survival analysis was used to determine the relationship between OTUD1 expression levels and the survival rate of cancer patients. Results: By screening a DUB expression library, we determined that the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUD1 regulates MCL1 protein stability in an enzymatic-activity dependent manner. OTUD1 interacts with MCL1 and promotes its deubiquitination. Knockdown of OTUD1 increases the sensitivity of tumour cells to the BH3-mimetic inhibitor ABT-263, while overexpression of OTUD1 increases tumour cell tolerance of ABT-263. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis data reveal that OTUD1 is a negative prognostic factor for liver cancer, ovarian cancer and specific subtypes of breast and cervical cancer. Conclusions: The deubiquitinating enzyme OTUD1 antagonizes BH3-mimetic inhibitor induced cell death through regulating the stability of the MCL1 protein. Thus, OTUD1 could be considered as a therapeutic target for curing these cancers.","['Wu, Lanqin', 'Lin, Yingying', 'Feng, Jinan', 'Qi, Yuanlin', 'Wang, Xinrui', 'Lin, Qiaofa', 'Shi, Wanyan', 'Zheng, Enrun', 'Wang, Wei', 'Hou, Zhenzhu', 'Lin, Hanbin', 'Yu, Cheng', 'He, Yan', 'Xu, Yan', 'Yang, Hong', 'Lin, Ling', 'Li, Lisheng']","['Wu L', 'Lin Y', 'Feng J', 'Qi Y', 'Wang X', 'Lin Q', 'Shi W', 'Zheng E', 'Wang W', 'Hou Z', 'Lin H', 'Yu C', 'He Y', 'Xu Y', 'Yang H', 'Lin L', 'Li L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0793-272X'],"['1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '2State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.0000 0004 0368 8293grid.16821.3c', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '1The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3', '3Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Gastrointestinal Cancer, Fujian Medical University, 1 Xueyuan Road, Minhou, Fuzhou China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190827,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC6712616,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3-mimetic inhibitor', 'Deubiquitinating enzyme', 'MCL1', 'OTUD1']",2019/08/31 06:00,2019/08/31 06:01,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0936-5 [doi]', '936 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Aug 27;19:222. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0936-5. eCollection 2019.,,222,,,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce toxicity of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen, intravenous busulfan is usually used as a preparative regimen for AL patients undergoing allo-SCT. Systemic busulfan exposure, characterized by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), is strongly associated with clinical outcome. An AUC that is too high is associated with severe toxicities, while an AUC that is too low carries increased risks of disease recurrence and failure to engraft. Consequently, an optimal AUC interval needs to be determined for therapeutic use. To address the possibility that busulfan pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary significantly with patient characteristics, we propose a tailored approach to determine optimal covariate-specific AUC intervals. To estimate these personalized AUC intervals, we apply a flexible Bayesian nonparametric regression model based on a dependent Dirichlet process and Gaussian process, DDP-GP. Our analyses of a dataset of 151 patients identified optimal therapeutic intervals for AUC that varied substantively with age and whether the patient was in complete remission or had active disease at transplant. Extensive simulations to evaluate the DDP-GP model in similar settings showed that its performance compares favorably to alternative methods.

These mutations associate with a more aggressive disease compared to wild-type (WT) CLL. In this work we demonstrate a bidirectional functional relationship between NOTCH1 and the B cell receptor (BCR) pathways. By using highly homogeneous cohorts of primary CLL cells, activation of NOTCH1 is shown to increase expression of surface IgM, as well as LYN, BTK, and BLNK, ultimately enhancing BCR signaling responses, including global mRNA translation. Upon BCR cross-linking, NOTCH1 itself is actively translated and increased on cell surface. Furthermore, BCR ligation induces calcium mobilization that can facilitate ligand-independent NOTCH1 activation. These data suggest that the two pathways are functionally linked, providing a rationale for dual inhibition strategies. Consistently, addition of the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT to ibrutinib significantly potentiates its effects, both in vitro and in a short-term patient-derived xenograft model. While this observation may find limited applications in the CLL field, it is more relevant for Richter's Syndrome (RS) management, where very few successful therapeutic options exist. Treatment of RS-patient-derived xenografts (RS-PDX) with the combination of ibrutinib and DAPT decreases disease burden and increases overall survival.","['Arruga, Francesca', 'Bracciama, Valeria', 'Vitale, Nicoletta', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Gizzi, Katiuscia', 'Yeomans, Alison', 'Coscia, Marta', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Allan, John N', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Packham, Graham', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Arruga F', 'Bracciama V', 'Vitale N', 'Vaisitti T', 'Gizzi K', 'Yeomans A', 'Coscia M', ""D'Arena G"", 'Gaidano G', 'Allan JN', 'Furman RR', 'Packham G', 'Forconi F', 'Deaglio S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2211-1831', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0632-5036']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. francesca.arruga@unito.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine, IIGM, Turin, Italy.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Haematological Oncology Group, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase (Tet2), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and solute carrier family 23 member 2 (Slc23a2) are the major target genes in the treatment of leukemia and are relevant to vitamin C. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using whole-genome expression profiles from mouse livers, the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), correlation matrix, and gene network graph were constructed with probes from each of these three genes and with their relative genes. The function of key genes was examined by their pathways and reported information. The results indicated that although direct correlations among their expression levels were not strong, alternative connecting pathways were discovered. By comparing the expression levels of one probe with known sequences from each of the three genes, we identified several key genes, induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl1), far upstream element-binding protein 1 (Fubp1), and tumor protein D52-like 2 (Tpd52l2), which play important roles in acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia. In conclusion, Alternative pathways and key genes that connect Tet2, Bcl2, and Slc23a2 for their therapeutic applications with vitamin C were identified.","['Li, Jing', 'Zhang, Wenqi', 'Liu, Weidong', 'Rong, Jarrett', 'Chen, Yuhan', 'Gu, Weikuan', 'Zhang, Wei']","['Li J', 'Zhang W', 'Liu W', 'Rong J', 'Chen Y', 'Gu W', 'Zhang W']",,"['Department of Orthopedic Surgery and BME-Campbell Clinic, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, U.S.A.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery and BME-Campbell Clinic, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, U.S.A.', 'College of Basic Medicine, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, P.R.

Since the prevalence of EM AML has so far only been clinically determined on examination, we performed a prospective study in patients with AML. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of metabolically active EM AML using total body (18)Fluorodesoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) imaging at diagnosis prior to initiation of therapy. In order to define the dynamics of EM AML throughout treatment, PET-positive patients underwent a second (18)FDG-PET/CT imaging series during follow up by the time of remission assessment. A total of 93 patients with AML underwent (18)FDG-PET/CT scans at diagnosis. The prevalence of PET-positive EM AML was 19% with a total of 65 EM AML manifestations and a median number of two EM manifestations per patient (range, 1-12), with a median maximum standardized uptake value of 6.1 (range, 2-51.4). When adding those three patients with histologically confirmed EM AML who were (18)FDG-PET/CT negative in the (18)FDG-PET/CT at diagnosis, the combined prevalence for EM AML was 22%, resulting in 77% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Importantly, 60% (6 of 10) patients with histologically confirmed EM AML still had active EM disease in their follow up (18)FDG-PET/CT. (18)FDG-PET/CT reveals a high prevalence of metabolically active EM disease in AML patients. Metabolic activity in EM AML may persist even beyond the time point of hematologic remission, a finding that merits further prospective investigation to explore its prognostic relevance.

Increased genomic complexity was a hallmark of relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive high-risk CLL. In relapsed/refractory cases previously exposed to the selective pressure of chemo(immuno)therapy, gain(8)(q24.21) and del(9)(p21.3) were particularly enriched. Both alterations affect key regulators of cell-cycle progression, namely MYC and CDKN2A/B While homozygous CDKN2A/B loss has been directly associated with Richter transformation, we did not find this association for heterozygous loss of CDKN2A/B Gains in 8q24.21 were either focal gains in a MYC enhancer region or large gains affecting the MYC locus, but only the latter type was highly enriched in relapsed/refractory CLL (17%). In addition to a high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations (23%), we found recurrent genetic alterations in SPEN (4% mutated), RBPJ (8% deleted) and SNW1 (8% deleted), all affecting a protein complex that represses transcription of NOTCH1 target genes. We investigated the functional impact of these alterations on HES1, DTX1 and MYC gene transcription and found derepression of these NOTCH1 target genes particularly with SPEN mutations. In summary, we provide new insights into the genomic architecture of high-risk CLL, define novel recurrent DNA copy number alterations and refine knowledge on del(9p), gain(8q) and alterations affecting NOTCH1 signaling.

Further improvements in survival demand better understanding of T-ALL biology and development of new therapeutic strategies. The Notch pathway has been involved in the pathogenesis of this disease and various therapeutic strategies are currently under development, including selective targeting of NOTCH receptors by inhibitory antibodies. We previously demonstrated that the NOTCH1-specific neutralizing antibody OMP52M51 prolongs survival in TALL patient-derived xenografts bearing NOTCH1/FBW7 mutations. However, acquired resistance to OMP52M51 eventually developed and we used patient-derived xenografts models to investigate this phenomenon. Multi-level molecular characterization of T-ALL cells resistant to NOTCH1 blockade and serial transplantation experiments uncovered heterogeneous types of resistance, not previously reported with other Notch inhibitors. In one model, resistance appeared after 156 days of treatment, it was stable and associated with loss of Notch inhibition, reduced mutational load and acquired NOTCH1 mutations potentially affecting the stability of the heterodimerization domain. Conversely, in another model resistance developed after only 43 days of treatment despite persistent down-regulation of Notch signaling and it was accompanied by modulation of lipid metabolism and reduced surface expression of NOTCH1. Our findings shed light on heterogeneous mechanisms adopted by the tumor to evade NOTCH1 blockade and support clinical implementation of antibody-based target therapy for Notch-addicted tumors.","['Agnusdei, Valentina', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Pinazza, Marica', 'Gasparini, Alessandra', 'Pezze, Laura', 'Amaro, Adriana Agnese', 'Pasqualini, Lorenza', 'Bianco, Paola Del', 'Tognon, Martina', 'Frasson, Chiara', 'Palumbo, Pietro', 'Ciribilli, Yari', 'Pfeffer, Ulrich', 'Carella, Massimo', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Indraccolo, Stefano']","['Agnusdei V', 'Minuzzo S', 'Pinazza M', 'Gasparini A', 'Pezze L', 'Amaro AA', 'Pasqualini L', 'Bianco PD', 'Tognon M', 'Frasson C', 'Palumbo P', 'Ciribilli Y', 'Pfeffer U', 'Carella M', 'Amadori A', 'Indraccolo S']",,"['Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Genetics, Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento.', 'Tumor Epigenetics, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova.', 'Tumor Epigenetics, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova.', 'Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Fondazione Citta della Speranza, Padova.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Genetics, Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento.', 'Tumor Epigenetics, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190829,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7193477,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.217687 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.217687 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1317-1328. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.217687.

By whole exome sequencing, we studied the genomics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who needed multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions after intensive chemotherapy treatment. ARHGEF12, encoding a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, was found to be associated with chemotherapy-induced anemia by genome-wide association study analyses. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ARHGEF12 located in an intron predicted to be a GATA1 binding site, rs10892563, is significantly associated with patients who need RBC transfusion (P=3.469E-03, odds ratio 5.864). A luciferase reporter assay revealed that this SNP impairs GATA1-mediated trans-regulation of ARHGEF12, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies confirmed that the homozygotes status is associated with an approximately 61% reduction in ARHGEF12 expression (P=0.0088). Consequently, erythropoiesis was affected at the pro-erythroblast phases. The role of ARHGEF12 and its homologs in erythroid differentiation was confirmed in human K562 cells, mouse 32D cells and primary murine bone marrow cells. We further demonstrated in zebrafish by morpholino-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of arhgef12 that its reduction resulted in erythropoiesis defects. The p38 kinase pathway was affected by the ARHGEF12-RhoA signaling in K562 cells, and consistently, the Arhgef12-RhoA-p38 pathway was also shown to be important for erythroid differentiation in zebrafish as active RhoA or p38 readily rescued the impaired erythropoiesis caused by arhgef12 knockdown. Finally, ARHGEF12-mediated p38 activity also appeared to be involved in phenotypes of patients of the rs10892563 homozygous genotype. Our findings present a novel SNP of ARHGEF12 that may involve ARHGEF12-RhoA-p38 signaling in erythroid regeneration in ALL patients after chemotherapy.","['Xie, Yangyang', 'Gao, Li', 'Xu, Chunhui', 'Chu, Liming', 'Gao, Lei', 'Wu, Ruichi', 'Liu, Yu', 'Liu, Ting', 'Sun, Xiao-Jian', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Zhou, Yong', 'Shen, Shuhong']","['Xie Y', 'Gao L', 'Xu C', 'Chu L', 'Gao L', 'Wu R', 'Liu Y', 'Liu T', 'Sun XJ', 'Ren R', 'Tang J', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Shen S']",,"[""Key Lab of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Beijing, China.', ""Key Lab of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Lab of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Lab of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China.', ""Key Lab of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH, USA Yi.Zheng@cchmc.org."", 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China zhouyong@sibs.ac.cn.', ""Key Lab of Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China shenshuhong@scmc.com.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190829,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7109745,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.210286 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.210286 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Apr;105(4):925-936. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.210286.

Although STAT3 is an inducer of transcription of a large number of oncogenes, so far its relationship with miRNAs has not been evaluated in T-LGLL patients. Here, we investigated whether STAT3 could carry out its pathogenetic role in T-LGLL through an altered expression of miRNAs. The expression level of 756 mature miRNA was assessed on purified T large granular lymphocytes (T-LGLs) by using a TaqMan Human microRNA Array. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis of miRNA array data shows that the global miRNome clusters with CD8 T-LGLs. Remarkably, CD8 T-LGLs exhibit a selective and STAT3-dependent repression of miR-146b expression, that significantly correlated with the absolute neutrophil counts and inversely correlated with the expression of Fas ligand (FasL), that is regarded as the most relevant factor in the pathogenesis of neutropenia. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the STAT3-dependent reduction of miR-146b expression in CD8 T-LGLs occurs as a consequence of miR-146b promoter hypermethylation and results in the disruption of the HuR-mediated post-transcriptional machinery controlling FasL mRNA stabilization. Restoring miR-146b expression in CD8 T-LGLs lead to a reduction of HuR protein and, in turn, of FasL mRNA expression, thus providing mechanistic insights for the existence of a STAT3-miR146b-FasL axis and neutropenia in T-LGLL.","['Mariotti, Barbara', 'Calabretto, Giulia', 'Rossato, Marzia', 'Teramo, Antonella', 'Castellucci, Monica', 'Barila, Gregorio', 'Leoncin, Matteo', 'Vicenzetto, Cristina', 'Facco, Monica', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Bazzoni, Flavia', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Mariotti B', 'Calabretto G', 'Rossato M', 'Teramo A', 'Castellucci M', 'Barila G', 'Leoncin M', 'Vicenzetto C', 'Facco M', 'Semenzato G', 'Bazzoni F', 'Zambello R']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, University of Verona, Verona.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, University of Verona, Verona.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, University of Verona, Verona.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of General Pathology, University of Verona, Verona flavia.bazzoni@univr.it.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology section, University of Padua, Padua.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190829,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7193483,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.225060 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.225060 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1351-1360. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.225060.

Analyses of clonality, somatic mutations, and gene expression in the malignant cells confirmed the report of rapid clonal expansion after PD-1 blockade in these patients, revealed a previously unappreciated origin of these malignant cells, identified a novel connection between ATLL cells and tumor-resident regulatory T cells (Tregs), and exposed a tumor-suppressive role for PD-1 in ATLL. Identifying the mechanisms driving this alarming outcome in nivolumab-treated ATLL may be broadly informative for the growing problem of rapid progression with immune checkpoint therapies.","['Rauch, Daniel A', 'Conlon, Kevin C', 'Janakiram, Murali', 'Brammer, Jonathan E', 'Harding, John C', 'Ye, B Hilda', 'Zang, Xingxing', 'Ren, Xiaoxin', 'Olson, Sydney', 'Cheng, Xiaogang', 'Miljkovic, Milos D', 'Sundaramoorthi, Hemalatha', 'Joseph, Ancy', 'Skidmore, Zachary L', 'Griffith, Obi', 'Griffith, Malachi', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Ratner, Lee']","['Rauch DA', 'Conlon KC', 'Janakiram M', 'Brammer JE', 'Harding JC', 'Ye BH', 'Zang X', 'Ren X', 'Olson S', 'Cheng X', 'Miljkovic MD', 'Sundaramoorthi H', 'Joseph A', 'Skidmore ZL', 'Griffith O', 'Griffith M', 'Waldmann TA', 'Ratner L']",,"['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['K99 HG007940/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002734/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 HG007940/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK100525/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA234640/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6839957,,,2019/08/31 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)74025-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002038 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Oct 24;134(17):1406-1414. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002038.,20200217,1406-1414,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '31YO63LBSN (Nivolumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nivolumab/*therapeutic use', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02631746'],['Blood. 2019 Oct 24;134(17):1366-1367.

Here, we report the discovery of an aminopyrazole, 2-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-N-(5-cyclobutyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)acetamide (analog 24), which selectively inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 5 over CDK2 in cancer cell lines. We also show that analog 24 reduced Mcl-1 levels in a concentration-dependent manner in cancer cell lines. Using a panel of doxycycline inducible cell lines, we show that CDK5 inhibitor 24 selectively modulates Mcl-1 function while the CDK4/6 inhibitor 6-acetyl-8-cyclopentyl-5-methyl-2-(5-(piperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-ylamino)pyrido[2,3 -day]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one does not. Previous studies using RNA interference and CRISPR showed that concurrent elimination of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 resulted in induction of apoptosis. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, we show that either CDK5 knockdown or expression of a dominant negative CDK5 results in synergistic induction of apoptosis. Moreover, concurrent pharmacological perturbation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL in pancreatic cancer cell lines using a CDK5 inhibitor analog 24 that reduced Mcl-1 levels and 4-(4-{[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl]methyl}-1-piperazinyl)-N -[(4-{[(2R)-4-(4-morpholinyl)-1-(phenylsulfanyl)-2-butanyl]amino}-3-[(trifluorome thyl)sulfonyl]phenyl)sulfonyl] benzamide (navitoclax), a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor, resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate targeting CDK5 will sensitize pancreatic cancers to Bcl-2 protein inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Mcl-1 is stabilized by CDK5-mediated phosphorylation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, resulting in the deregulation of the apoptotic pathway. Thus, genetic or pharmacological targeting of CDK5 sensitizes pancreatic cancers to Bcl-2 inhibitors, such as navitoclax.","['Kour, Smit', 'Rana, Sandeep', 'Contreras, Jacob I', 'King, Hannah M',

Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) can closely regulate carcinogenesis and thus we analyzed the possible action of FCN may have on these two signaling cascades in tumor cells. The effect of FCN on NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling cascades and its downstream functions was deciphered using diverse assays in both human chronic myeloid leukemia (KBM5) and multiple myeloma (U266). FCN attenuated growth of both leukemic and multiple myeloma cells and repressed NF-kappaB, and AP-1 activation through diverse mechanisms, including attenuation of phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and p65. Furthermore, FCN could also cause significant enhancement in TNFalpha-driven apoptosis as studied by various molecular techniques. Thus, FCN may exhibit potent anti-neoplastic effects by affecting diverse oncogenic pathways and may be employed as pro-apoptotic agent against various malignancies.","['Jung, Young Yun', 'Shanmugam, Muthu K', 'Chinnathambi, Arunachalam', 'Alharbi, Sulaiman Ali', 'Shair, Omar H M', 'Um, Jae-Young', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok']","['Jung YY', 'Shanmugam MK', 'Chinnathambi A', 'Alharbi SA', 'Shair OHM', 'Um JY', 'Sethi G', 'Ahn KS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2882-0612'],"['Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117600, Singapore.', 'Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117600, Singapore. phcgs@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea. ksahn@khu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190828,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC6749215,['NOTNLM'],"['AP-1', 'NF-kappaB', 'apoptosis', 'cancer', 'fangchinoline']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24173127 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24173127 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Aug 28;24(17). pii: molecules24173127. doi: 10.3390/molecules24173127.,20200121,,,"['0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '953592C3ZB (fangchinoline)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct genetic and epigenetic aberrations are key features of AML that account for its variable response to standard therapy. Irrespective of their oncogenic mutations, AML cells produce elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). They also alter expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes to promote cell proliferation and survival. Subsequently, selective targeting of redox homeostasis in a molecularly heterogeneous disease, such as AML, has been an appealing approach in the development of novel anti-leukemic chemotherapeutics. Naphthoquinones are able to undergo redox cycling and generate ROS in cancer cells, which have made them excellent candidates for testing against AML cells. In addition to inducing oxidative imbalance in AML cells, depending on their structure, naphthoquinones negatively affect other cellular apparatus causing neoplastic cell death. Here we provide an overview of the anti-AML activities of naphthoquinone derivatives, as well as analysis of their mechanism of action, including induction of reduction-oxidation imbalance, alteration in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, Bcl-2 modulation, initiation of DNA damage, and modulation of MAPK and STAT3 activity, alterations in the unfolded protein response and translocation of FOX-related transcription factors to the nucleus.","['Lee, Michelle H', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Ferraris, Dana', 'Emadi, Ashkan']","['Lee MH', 'Lapidus RG', 'Ferraris D', 'Emadi A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3769-3210'],"['Department of Medicine Division of Hematology/Oncology University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Division of Hematology/Oncology University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, McDaniel College, 2 College Hill, Westminster, MD 21157, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Division of Hematology/Oncology University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. aemadi@umm.edu.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. aemadi@umm.edu.']",['eng'],['NCI P30CA134274-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190828,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC6749238,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'apoptosis', 'mechanism of action', 'naphthoquinone', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2019/08/31 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/08/31 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24173121 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24173121 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Aug 28;24(17). pii: molecules24173121. doi: 10.3390/molecules24173121.,20200121,,,"['0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined genetic and pharmacological inhibition emphasized that co-treatment of GANT61 and A-1210477 indeed relies on inhibition of GLI1 (by GANT61) and MCL-1 (by A-1210477). Mechanistic studies revealed that A-1210477 triggers the release of BIM from MCL-1 and its shuttling to BCL-xL and BCL-2. Indeed, BIM proved to be required for GANT61/A-1210477-induced cell death, as genetic silencing of BIM using siRNA significantly rescues cell death upon GANT61/A-1210477 co-treatment. Similarly, genetic silencing of NOXA results in a significant reduction of GANT61/A-1210477-mediated cell death. Also, overexpression of MCL-1 or BCL-2 significantly protects RMS cells from GANT61/A-1210477-triggered cell death. Addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk significantly decreases GANT61/A-1210477-stimulated cell demise, indicating apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, GANT61 and A-1210477 synergize to engage mitochondrial apoptosis. These findings provide the rationale for further evaluation of dual inhibition of HH signaling and MCL-1 in HH-driven cancers.","['Meister, Michael Torsten', 'Boedicker, Cathinka', 'Linder, Benedikt', 'Kogel, Donat', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Meister MT', 'Boedicker C', 'Linder B', 'Kogel D', 'Klingebiel T', 'Fulda S']",,"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Experimental Neurosurgery, Neuroscience Center, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany; Experimental Neurosurgery, Neuroscience Center, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

Its prevalence in the general population is poorly understood. The potential for prevention motivated us to do a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies to estimate the prevalence of HTLV-1 in SSA. METHODS: A comprehensive, no-limit search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from their inception dates to March 2019. Population-based studies presenting data on HTLV-1 in sub-Saharan Africa were included. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were included, representing 42 297 participants. The pooled HTLV-1 seroprevalence was 3.19% (95% CI 2.36-4.12%) with variations across year of study. Prevalence of HTLV-1 positively correlated with year of study (beta = 0.0036, P = 0.007). Participants from Central, Western and Southern Africa had a seroprevalence of 4.16% (95% CI 2.43-6.31%), 2.66% (95% CI 1.80-3.68%) and 1.56% (95% CI 0.48-3.15%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HTLV-1 infection is a public health concern in SSA and highlight the need to implement effective preventive programmes and interventions aimed at reducing the burden of this common yet neglected infection.","['Ngoma, Alain M', 'Omokoko, Magot D', 'Mutombo, Paulin B', 'Mvika, Eddy S', 'Muwonga, Jeremie M', 'Nollet, Kenneth E', 'Ohto, Hitoshi']","['Ngoma AM', 'Omokoko MD', 'Mutombo PB', 'Mvika ES', 'Muwonga JM', 'Nollet KE', 'Ohto H']",,"['Douglas Hospital Research Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Hopital de la Cite-de-la-Sante, affiliated to the University of Montreal, Laval, QC, Canada.', 'School of Public Health, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.', 'Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.', 'Laboratoire National de Reference du Sida, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Radiation Medical Science Center, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Radiation Medical Science Center, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20190930,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Afrique subsaharienne', '*HTLV-1', '*population-based studies', '*sub-Saharan Africa', '*etudes de population']",2019/08/30 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tmi.13305 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2019 Nov;24(11):1277-1290. doi: 10.1111/tmi.13305.

EXT1 is regarded as a classic tumor suppressor. MiR-665 can act as either an oncogene or tumor-suppressing gene in different tumors. The aim of the current study was to determine the function and molecular mechanisms of EXT1 and miR-665 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIAL AND METHODS EXT1 expression in ALL was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. The effects of EXT1 in ALL were explored by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)/EdU assays, western blotting, flow cytometry, and in vivo tumorigenesis assays. Label-free quantification was used to detect differentially expressed proteins in EXT1-overexpressing Reh cells. RESULTS EXT1 expression is downregulated in ALL and negatively correlated with miR-665 expression. Moreover, low EXT1 and high miR-665 expression levels in adult ALL bone marrow tissues are correlated with poor patient survival. Our study showed that EXT1 modulates the proliferation and apoptosis of ALL cells in vitro and in vivo and that miR-665 promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis by suppressing EXT1. EXT1 promotes cell apoptosis via deactivating the ERK1/2 pathway. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, this study is the first to confirm the association between low EXT1 levels and several clinical features of ALL.

Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) encodes a histone methyltransferase that promotes transcriptional activation and is frequently mutated in cancers and in the majority (>70%) of patients diagnosed with the congenital, multisystem intellectual disability disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1). Critical roles for KMT2D are established in various non-neural tissues, but the effects of KMT2D loss in brain cell development have not been described. We conducted parallel studies of proliferation, differentiation, transcription, and chromatin profiling in KMT2D-deficient human and mouse models to define KMT2D-regulated functions in neurodevelopmental contexts, including adult-born hippocampal NSPCs in vivo and in vitro. We report cell-autonomous defects in proliferation, cell cycle, and survival, accompanied by early NSPC maturation in several KMT2D-deficient model systems. Transcriptional suppression in KMT2D-deficient cells indicated strong perturbation of hypoxia-responsive metabolism pathways. Functional experiments confirmed abnormalities of cellular hypoxia responses in KMT2D-deficient neural cells and accelerated NSPC maturation in vivo. Together, our findings support a model in which loss of KMT2D function suppresses expression of oxygen-responsive gene programs important to neural progenitor maintenance, resulting in precocious neuronal differentiation in a mouse model of KS1.","['Carosso, Giovanni A', 'Boukas, Leandros', 'Augustin, Jonathan J', 'Nguyen, Ha Nam', 'Winer, Briana L', 'Cannon, Gabrielle H', 'Robertson, Johanna D', 'Zhang, Li', 'Hansen, Kasper D', 'Goff, Loyal A', 'Bjornsson, Hans T']","['Carosso GA', 'Boukas L', 'Augustin JJ', 'Nguyen HN', 'Winer BL', 'Cannon GH', 'Robertson JD', 'Zhang L', 'Hansen KD', 'Goff LA', 'Bjornsson HT']",,"['Predoctoral Training Program in Human Genetics.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine.', 'Predoctoral Training Program in Human Genetics.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine.', 'Department of Biostatistics.', 'McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine.', 'Predoctoral Training Program in Biochemistry, Cellular, and Molecular Biology.', 'Solomon H.

Platelets are pivotal in primary hemostasis, and possess non-hemostatic properties involved in angiogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation and metastatis. Also, platelets safeguard vascular integrity in inflamed vessels. Overall, bleeding risk depends on the underlying disease, and patients with cancer and platelet count <6-10 x 109/L have a markedly increased bleeding risk, while the platelet count does not correlate with bleeding risk at higher platelet counts. Other factors might affect platelet properties and thus bleeding risk, for example, drugs, low hematocrit, coagulation system impairments or transfusion of dysfunctional donor platelets. For patients with leukemia and immune thrombocytopenia, reduced platelet activation, platelet aggregation, or thrombopoiesis, reflected by the reduced presence of reticulated platelets, are associated with bleeding phenotype. However, mechanistic insight into the cause of reduced platelet function in different thrombocytopenic conditions is sparse, except for some inherited platelet disorders. Promising tools for platelet function studies in thrombocytopenia are flow cytometry and biomarker studies on platelet constituents. An important message from this current paper is that bleeding risk assessment must be tailored to specific patient populations and cannot be applied broadly to all patients with thrombocytopenia.","['Vinholt, Pernille J']",['Vinholt PJ'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2035-0169'],"['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Odense University Hospital, J.B.

Tagraxofusp is an intravenously administered CD123-directed cytotoxin consisting of the fusion of interleukin-3 with a truncated diphtheria toxin payload and was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults and children aged 2 and older with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). Areas Covered: In this review, we discuss the use of tagraxofusp in BPDCN, and active clinical trials involving this agent in several hematologic malignancies are also presented. Tagraxofusp has significant efficacy in patients with BPDCN and manageable safety profile, with the most commonly reported adverse events being asymptomatic elevation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, hypoalbuminemia, peripheral edema, and thrombocytopenia. The most serious side effect is capillary leak syndrome that can be lethal in some cases but the risk may be mitigated by early recognition and intervention. Expert Opinion: Tagraxofusp has been introduced as a novel treatment of BPDCN, a rare hematologic malignancy, for which no standard therapy previously existed. Many patients treated with this agent were able to be bridged to stem cell transplantation, including older patients. In the future, combinations of tagraxofusp with other targeted agents will be explored.","['Economides, Minas P', 'McCue, Deborah', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['Economides MP', 'McCue D', 'Lane AA', 'Pemmaraju N']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4625-421X'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas School of Health Sciences at Houston , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191001,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,,['NOTNLM'],"['BPDCN', 'CD123', 'Tagraxofusp', 'leukemia']",2019/08/30 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2019.1662297 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Oct;12(10):941-946. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2019.1662297.

Factor (F) XIII deficiency, an extremely rare hemorrhagic disease, can cause fatal bleeding, which has been previously described in autoimmune disorders and leukemias. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 38-year-old woman with a 20-day history of spontaneous subcutaneous hemorrhage visited our hospital, who presented with intracranial hemorrhage, hematuria, and delayed hematoma after a bone marrow puncture. Initial management included cytogenetics analysis, molecular analysis, and coagulation evaluation. DIAGNOSIS: Bone marrow puncture, cytogenetics, and molecular analysis indicated the diagnosis of CML. With the normal results of clotting screening tests and platelet counting, as well as the relief of bleeding after infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), acquired rare bleeding disorder probably associated with factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency. INTERVENTIONS: Management with anti-hyperleukocytosis and chemotherapy, hydration, alkalization, diuresis, uric acid-lowering, molecular targeted drugs, and freshly frozen plasma transfusion therapy resolved the bleeding diathesis. OUTCOMES: The patient survived from the initial bleeding, however, she died. Twenty six months later due to the progression of CML. LESSONS: CML can initially present as unusual bleeding, possibly related to FXIII defect. It is essential to screen coagulopathy including FXIII activity and to supplement plasma for CML patients who present initially as bleeding, which cannot be deciphered by the routine clotting screening test.","['Wang, Yanzhi', 'Wang, Lina', 'Xi, Yaming', 'Li, Zijian']","['Wang Y', 'Wang L', 'Xi Y', 'Li Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC6736460,,,2019/08/30 06:00,2019/09/17 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016984 [doi]', '00005792-201908300-00058 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Aug;98(35):e16984. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016984.,20190916,e16984,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Factor XIII Deficiency/*complications', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Plasma']",,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received intense conditioning regimens with combined fludarabine and high-dose cyclophosphamide (FC) before undergoing UCBT. Sixty-seven patients received a single UCBT, and 14 patients received a double UCBT. Fifty patients were pretreated with the fludarabine, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide (FBC) protocol, while 31 patients were treated with FC before transplantation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was prevented with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil administration. According to low-resolution, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) donor-recipient matching at six sites, 53 patients had 5-6 matches, while 28 patients had 4 matches. Seventy-eight patients (96.3%) achieved complete engraftment in this study. Thirty-six patients developed acute GVHD (aGVHD). The cumulative incidence of grade I-II aGVHD at day 100 posthematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 29.6%, and the cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD was 14.8%. At the end of the follow-up, 12 patients died due to treatment-related complications, and 4 died of disease relapse after transplantation. The transplant-related deaths were due to transplant-related infection (8 of 81), GVHD (2 of 81), and organ toxicity (2 of 81). The probability of overall survival (OS) was 80.2%. A higher dose of cyclophosphamide combined with fludarabine conditioning in UCBT was an effective curative method for treatment of hematologic disorders and could enhance the engraftment of umbilical cord blood stem cells, promote post-transplant immune reconstitution, and improve OS.","['Yu, Zheng-Ping', 'Ding, Jia-Hua', 'Sun, Ai-Ning', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Ge, Zheng', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Yu ZP', 'Ding JH', 'Sun AN', 'Chen BA', 'Ge Z', 'Wu DP']",,"['Department of Hematology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), Zhong Da Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), Zhong Da Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', ""Hematology Division, Soochow University Affiliated No 1 People's Hospital, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of Hematology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), Zhong Da Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), Zhong Da Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', ""Hematology Division, Soochow University Affiliated No 1 People's Hospital, Suzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190926,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*cord blood transplantation', '*hematologic system diseases']",2019/08/30 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2019.0139 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2019 Oct 15;28(20):1376-1383. doi: 10.1089/scd.2019.0139.

Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain (KD) are an important mechanism of TKI resistance in CML. In this review, we present molecular mechanisms of TKI resistance paying particular attention to drug resistance which allows for a survival advantage in CML. RECENT FINDINGS: Sensitive disease monitoring is a required standard of care for management of CML. Screening of these mutations fail to explain 20-40% of resistant cases where activation of different survival pathways must be the main reason for resistance. Eliminating TKI resistance appears to be the most successful therapeutic way to decrease leukemic disease burden and potentiate cure. Advances on novel strategies for identifying and confronting drug resistance are rapidly altering management of CML that are resistant to TKI and expanding the landscape of available therapies.","['Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Yeung, Cecilia Cs']","['Yaghmaie M', 'Yeung CC']",,"['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. marjix58@gmail.com.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Molecular mechanism', '*Resistance mutations', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/30 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00543-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00543-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Oct;14(5):395-404. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00543-7.,20200730,395-404,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of surface IgM (sIgM) alone or with light chain restriction indicates a mature blast phenotype (BIV by EGIL) and is usually observed in BL. However, sIgM expression could also be detected in transitional BCP-ALL cases. These similarities in immunophenotype and ambiguous correspondence with other laboratory findings may challenge the correct BL diagnostics. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the available data from immunophenotypic, morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic studies of 146 children (85 boys and 61 girls) with a median age of 10 years (range 0-18 years) who were diagnosed with BL and BCP-ALL. The blasts' immunophenotype was studied by multicolor FCM. The conventional cytogenetic analysis included G-banded karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: In 54 children classified as BIV-ALL according to the EGIL, it was demonstrated that sIgM in a minority of cases can be associated with various types of BCP-ALL. Analysis of the antigen expression profile of 105 patients with verified BL (n = 21) and BCP-ALL (n = 84) showed significant differences in BL and the sIgM(+) vs BCP-ALL immunophenotype. Thus, even in cases of ambiguous sIgM expression, these two diseases could be reliably discriminated by complex immunophenotyping. Moreover, 10 patients (7 boys and 3 girls) with BL leukemic cells did not express sIgM, and they were diagnosed with BL on the basis of other laboratory and clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study shows that BIV subtype is heterogeneous group of leukemia including not only the BL, but also BCP-ALL. In ambiguous cases, only a combination of multiple immunophenotypic, cytomorphologic, and genetic diagnostic technologies can allow the precise discrimination of BL and BCP-ALL and selection of the appropriate treatment scheme.","['Demina, Irina', 'Zerkalenkova, Elena', 'Illarionova, Olga', 'Olshanskaya, Yulia', 'Verzhbitskaya, Tatiana', 'Semchenkova, Alexandra', 'Tsaur, Grigory', 'Rusanova, Ekaterina', 'Belogurova, Margarita', 'Baidun, Ludmila', 'Plyasunova, Svetlana', 'Konyuhova, Tatiana', 'Kazakova, Anna', 'Fechina, Larisa', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Samochatova, Elena', 'Myakova, Natalia', 'Maschan, Alexey', 'Popov, Alexander M']","['Demina I', 'Zerkalenkova E', 'Illarionova O', 'Olshanskaya Y', 'Verzhbitskaya T', 'Semchenkova A', 'Tsaur G', 'Rusanova E', 'Belogurova M', 'Baidun L', 'Plyasunova S', 'Konyuhova T', 'Kazakova A', 'Fechina L', 'Novichkova G', 'Samochatova E', 'Myakova N', 'Maschan A', 'Popov AM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0889-6986'],"['Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 1 Samory Mashela St., GSP-7, Moscow, 117997, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 1 Samory Mashela St., GSP-7, Moscow, 117997, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 1 Samory Mashela St., GSP-7, Moscow, 117997, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 1 Samory Mashela St., GSP-7, Moscow, 117997, Russia.', ""Sverdlovsk Regional Clinical Children's Hospital No 1, 32 Serafimy Deryabinoy St., Ekaterinburg, 620149, Russia."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, 22a Karla Marksa St., Ekaterinburg, 620026, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 1 Samory Mashela St., GSP-7, Moscow, 117997, Russia.', ""Sverdlovsk Regional Clinical Children's Hospital No 1, 32 Serafimy Deryabinoy St., Ekaterinburg, 620149, Russia."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, 22a Karla Marksa St., Ekaterinburg, 620026, Russia.', 'Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education Ural Federal University named after the first President of Russia B.N.Yeltsin, 19 Mira Street, Ekaterinburg, 620002, Russia.', ""I.P.

Most cases of HP are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally upon laparotomy or on autopsy. The diagnosis of HP can be extremely difficult. A few imaging modalities which include Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may show characteristic features of HP. However, definitive diagnosis is made by histopathology. Conversely, these modalities may not differentiate a malignant neoplasm from a benign mass. Surgical excision is thought to be curative for HP. In this case report, we present a 62-year-old female with acute myelocytic leukemia on induction chemotherapy who developed abdominal pain during her hospital admission and was referred to the general surgery department. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was done and showed signs of small bowel obstruction, perforation, and overlapping jejunoileal segments suggestive of intussusception. Upon surgical exploration two small bowel perforations were repaired, one iatrogenic and one pathological. On bowel run a jejunal mass was found, excised, and upon histopathology confirmed to be a mixed endocrine and exocrine heterotopic pancreatic choristoma.

In order to assess the burden of these illness for public health planning, it is important to know their frequency. Objectives: A study to determine the clinical, hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular profile in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient in and around Eastern UP, India. Materials and Methods: Newly diagnosed and follow-up adult and pediatric cases of myeloproliferative disorder were taken into study. Detailed history, physical, and systemic examination was done with informed consent. Investigations like complete blood count including hemoglobin level, platelet count, total and differential leucocyte count, general blood picture, and bone marrow aspiration/biopsy were done. Molecular and cytogenetic studies were also done whenever required. Results: In total, 90 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age of presentation of CML was 37 years and the mean age was 38.6 years. M: F ratio of 1.4:1.75 patients (83%) were in CML-chronic phase (CP), 11 patients (12%) in CML-accelerated phase (AP) phase, and 4 patients (5%) were found in CML-blast crisis (BC) phase. The common symptoms of the patients were fullness of the abdomen (66.6%). Among these 69 cases, Philadelphia chromosome was present in 65 (94.2%) cases. Revers transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done in 40 out of 90 cases, breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson oncogene (ABL) gene came out to be positive in all the 40 cases.

Development of chemo-resistance is ultimately responsible for treatment failure and relapse, therefore understanding the molecular basis underlying resistance is imperative for developing innovative treatment strategies. Glucocorticoids (GCs) such dexamethasone and prednisolone are the backbone of combination chemotherapy regimens for treating all lymphoid tumors. However, the biological mechanisms of primary GC resistance in ALL is not completely understood. We previously performed a longitudinal whole-exome sequencing analysis on diagnosis/relapse pairs from adult patients with ALL. Our data revealed that relapse-specific truncation mutations in the NR3C1 gene, encoding the GC receptor, are frequently detected. Methods: In the current study, we used discovery-based strategies including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and CRISPR/Cas9, followed by confirmatory testing, in human ALL cell lines, bone marrow blast samples from ALL patients and xenograft models, to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for resistance. Results: Our results revealed a positive correlation between endogenous expression of NR3C1 in ALL cells and sensitivity to GCs and clinical outcomes. We further confirmed that ectopic expression of NR3C1 in ALL cells could reverse GC resistance, while deletion of NR3C1 confers resistance to GCs in ALL cell lines and xenograft models. RNA-seq analysis revealed a remarkable abundance of gene signatures involved in pathways in cancer, DNA replication, mismatch repair, P53 signalling, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulated by NR3C1. Significantly increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes including BCL2L11/Bim, BMF, BAD, BAX and BOK, and decreased transcription of anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2, BCL2L1 and BAG2 were observed in GC-resistant ALL cells following ectopic expression of NR3C1. Finally, we explored that GC resistance in ALL cells with haploinsufficiency of NR3C1 can be treated with Bcl-2 blockage. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the status of NR3C1 gene mutations and basal expression levels of NR3C1 in ALL cells are associated with sensitivity to GCs and clinical treatment outcomes. Early intervention strategies by rational combination of Bcl-2 blockage may constitute a promising new treatment option to GC-resistant ALL and significantly improving the chances of treating poor prednisone responders.","['Xiao, Haowen', 'Ding, Yingying', 'Gao, Yang', 'Wang, Li-Mengmeng', 'Wang, Huafang', 'Ding, Lijuan', 'Li, Xiaoqing', 'Yu, Xiaohong', 'Huang, He']","['Xiao H', 'Ding Y', 'Gao Y', 'Wang LM', 'Wang H', 'Ding L', 'Li X', 'Yu X', 'Huang H']",,"[""1Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 3 Qingchun East Rd., Hangzhou, 310016 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Zhongshan City, Zhongshan, Guangdong Province People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 3 Qingchun East Rd., Hangzhou, 310016 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""4Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Rd., Hangzhou, 310003 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6319grid.452661.2"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""4Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Rd., Hangzhou, 310003 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6319grid.452661.2"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""4Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Rd., Hangzhou, 310003 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6319grid.452661.2"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""4Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Rd., Hangzhou, 310003 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6319grid.452661.2"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""2Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34"", ""4Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Rd., Hangzhou, 310003 Zhejiang People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6319grid.452661.2""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190823,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC6708234,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bcl-2 blockage', 'Glucocorticoid resistance', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Mitochondrial apoptosis axis', 'NR3C1']",2019/08/30 06:00,2019/08/30 06:01,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0940-9 [doi]', '940 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Aug 23;19:218. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0940-9. eCollection 2019.,,218,,,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

This signalling pathway is the key determinant of the ability of the macrophages to respond to therapeutic antibodies in current clinical use for CLL. Muted FcgammaR signalling activity accompanies disease progression and results in resistance to therapeutic antibodies. The molecular mechanisms controlling FcgammaR signalling and resistance are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110delta is essential for CLL-derived macrophages to respond to therapeutic antibodies. Inhibition of p110delta in the macrophages reduces FcgammaR-mediated antibody immune responses. Surprisingly, our studies indicated that FcgammaR downstream signalling is independent of SYK and BTK activity. Thus, we show that FcgammaR antibody responses occur via a previously unidentified p110delta-dependent pathway, which is independent of the previously described SYK/BTK activation pathway. These data provide novel insights into the effectors of antibody responses. Our data also provide mechanistic insights into therapy resistance in CLL.","['Enya Chen, Yu-Chen', 'Burgess, Melinda', 'Mapp, Sally', 'Mollee, Peter', 'Gill, Devinder', 'Blumenthal, Antje', 'Saunders, Nicholas A']","['Enya Chen YC', 'Burgess M', 'Mapp S', 'Mollee P', 'Gill D', 'Blumenthal A', 'Saunders NA']",,"['University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia. nsaunders@uq.edu.au.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190828,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/30 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0556-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0556-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Feb;34(2):451-461. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0556-z.

CSF3R-V1 is the wild-type receptor, while CSF3R-V4 is a truncated form increased in some patients with AML. CSF3R-V3 mRNA was identified in placenta more than 20 years ago, but remains largely uncharacterized due to the lack of a suitable detection assay. Using a novel digital PCR method to quantitate expression of each CSF3R mRNA splice variant in hematopoietic cells, CSF3R-V1 was most highly expressed followed by CSF3R-V3. Functional assays revealed expression of V3 alone conferred a hypoproliferative phenotype associated with defective JAK-STAT activation. However, coexpression of V1 with V3 rescued proliferative responses. Comparative analysis of V3/V1 expression in CD34+ cells from healthy donors and patients with AML revealed a statistically significant increase in the V3/V1 ratio only in the subset of patients with AML harboring SRSF2 mutations. Knockout of SRFS2 in KG-1 and normal CD34+ cells decreased the V3/V1 ratio. Collectively, these data are the first to demonstrate expression of the CSF3R-V3 splice variant in primary human myeloid cells and a role for SRSF2 in modulating CSF3R splicing. Our findings provide confirmatory evidence that CSF3R is a target of SRSF2 mutations, which has implications for novel treatment strategies for SRSF2-mutated myeloid malignancies.","['Lance, Amanda', 'Druhan, Lawrence J', 'Vestal, C Greer', 'Steuerwald, Nury M', 'Hamilton, Alicia', 'Smith, Mathew', 'Price, Andrea', 'Tjaden, Elise', 'Fox, Andee N', 'Avalos, Belinda R']","['Lance A', 'Druhan LJ', 'Vestal CG', 'Steuerwald NM', 'Hamilton A', 'Smith M', 'Price A', 'Tjaden E', 'Fox AN', 'Avalos BR']",,"['The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Molecular Biology and Genomics Laboratory, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Molecular Biology and Genomics Laboratory, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Molecular Biology and Genomics Laboratory, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'The Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute; Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA. belinda.avalos@atriumhealth.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190828,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/30 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0567-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0567-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Feb;34(2):369-379. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0567-9.

Specifically, pDC interactions with tumor and T/NK effector cells in the bone marrow (BM) milieu induce immune suppression and MM cell proliferation. Delineation of the mechanism(s) mediating pDC-MM-T-NK cell interactions will identify novel therapeutic targets to both enhance cytotoxicity and anti-MM immunity. Here, we utilized gene expression profiling (GEP) to show that pDC-MM interactions trigger upregulation of immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolic kynurenine (Kyn) pathway. In particular, we show that Kyn pathway enzyme kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) is upregulated during pDC-MM interactions. Using our coculture models of patient autologous pDC-T-NK-MM cells, we show that pharmacological blockade of KMO activates pDCs and triggers both MM-specific cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes (CTL) and NK cells cytolytic activity against tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that simultaneous inhibition of Kyn pathway and immune checkpoint PD-L1 enhances antitumor immunity and cytotoxicity in MM. Our preclinical data therefore provide the basis for novel immune-based therapeutic approaches targeting Kyn metabolic pathway enzyme KMO, alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 Ab, to restore anti-MM immune responses in MM.","['Ray, Arghya', 'Song, Yan', 'Du, Ting', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu', 'Chauhan, Dharminder', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Ray A', 'Song Y', 'Du T', 'Tai YT', 'Chauhan D', 'Anderson KC']",,"['The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

Patients received obinutuzumab (G) plus bendamustine (Benda) induction followed by G maintenance, or Benda induction alone. Patients with a clonal marker (t[14;18] translocation and/or immunoglobulin heavy or light chain rearrangement) detected at study screening were assessed for MRD at mid-induction (MI), end of induction (EOI), and every 6-24 months post-EOI/discontinuation by real-time quantitative PCR. At MI, 41/52 (79%) patients receiving G-Benda were MRD-negative vs. 17/36 (47%) patients receiving Benda alone (p = 0.0029). At EOI, 54/63 (86%) patients receiving G-Benda were MRD-negative vs. 30/55 (55%) receiving Benda alone (p = 0.0002). MRD-negative patients at EOI had improved progression-free survival (HR, 0.33, 95% CI, 0.19-0.56, p < 0.0001) and overall survival (HR, 0.39, 95% CI, 0.19-0.78, p = 0.008) vs. MRD-positive patients, and maintained their MRD-negative status for longer if they received G maintenance than if they did not. These results suggest that the addition of G to Benda-based treatment during induction can significantly contribute to the speed and depth of response, and G maintenance in MRD-negative patients potentially delays lymphoma regrowth.","['Pott, Christiane', 'Sehn, Laurie H', 'Belada, David', 'Gribben, John', 'Hoster, Eva', 'Kahl, Brad', 'Kehden, Britta', 'Nicolas-Virelizier, Emmanuelle', 'Spielewoy, Nathalie', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Guenter', 'Harbron, Chris', 'Mundt, Kirsten', 'Wassner-Fritsch, Elisabeth', 'Cheson, Bruce D']","['Pott C', 'Sehn LH', 'Belada D', 'Gribben J', 'Hoster E', 'Kahl B', 'Kehden B', 'Nicolas-Virelizier E', 'Spielewoy N', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Harbron C', 'Mundt K', 'Wassner-Fritsch E', 'Cheson BD']",,"['University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany. c.pott@med2.uni-kiel.de.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Haematology, Charles University, Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'University of Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'F.

To further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which mutant CALR promotes MPN development, we studied the subcellular localization of mutant CALR and its importance for the oncogenic properties of mutant CALR. Here, mutant CALR accumulated in the Golgi apparatus, and its entrance into the secretion pathway and capacity to interact with N-glycan were required for its oncogenic capacity via the constitutive activation of MPL. Mutant CALR-dependent MPL activation was resistant to blockade of intracellular protein trafficking, suggesting that MPL is activated before reaching the cell surface.

Furthermore, we found that mutant CALR and MPL interact on the cell surface.

The availability/absence of a human leukocyte antigen-matched-related or matched-unrelated donor (MUD) determined the nature of the second SCT. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population (n = 199). Auto/alloSCT was performed in 126 patients; 74 received MUD allografts. After 91 months median follow-up, median PFS with auto/allo versus tandem autoSCT was 34.5 versus 21.8 months (P = 0.003; adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.84). Median overall survival (OS) was 70.2 versus 71.8 months (P = 0.856). Two-year non-relapse mortality with auto/allo versus tandem autoSCT was 14.3% versus 4.1% (P = 0.008). In patients harboring both del13q and del17p, median PFS and OS were 37.5 and 61.5 months with auto/allo (n = 19) versus 6.1 and 23.4 months with tandem autoSCT (n = 6) (P = 0.0002 and 0.032). Our findings suggest that auto/alloSCT significantly extends PFS versus tandem autoSCT in del13q MM, and indicate some survival benefit for first-line alloSCT in high-risk MM.","['Knop, Stefan', 'Engelhardt, Monika', 'Liebisch, Peter', 'Meisner, Christoph', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Metzner, Bernd', 'Peest, Dietrich', 'Kaufmann, Martin', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Straka, Christian', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Sezer, Orhan', 'Hentrich, Marcus', 'Ostermann, Helmut', 'Bassermann, Florian', 'Hess, Georg', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Freund, Mathias', 'Kropff, Martin', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Wolf, Hans-Heinrich', 'Jung, Wolfram', 'Frickhofen, Norbert', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Bargou, Ralf C', 'Maschmeyer, Georg', 'Svaldi, Mirija', 'Langer, Christian H', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Hebart, Holger', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Einsele, Hermann']","['Knop S', 'Engelhardt M', 'Liebisch P', 'Meisner C', 'Holler E', 'Metzner B', 'Peest D', 'Kaufmann M', 'Bunjes D', 'Straka C', 'Fischer T', 'Sezer O', 'Hentrich M', 'Ostermann H', 'Bassermann F', 'Hess G', 'Hertenstein B', 'Freund M', 'Kropff M', 'Schmidt CA', 'Wolf HH', 'Jung W', 'Frickhofen N', 'Mielke S', 'Bargou RC', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Svaldi M', 'Langer CH', 'Gramatzki M', 'Hebart H', 'Kanz L', 'Einsele H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2378-2466'],"['Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Wurzburg University Medical Centre, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, Tubingen University Medical School, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'University Clinic for Internal Medicine - Oncology and Haematology, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Haemostaseology, Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany.', 'Medical Centre, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Infectiology, Munich Schwabing Hospital, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Centre of Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite - Oncology Centre, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Red Cross Hospital, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'IIIrd Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Technical University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, Universitatsmedizin Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Klinikum Bremen Mitte, Bremen, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Greifswald University Hospital, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Halle, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Zentrum Innere Medizin, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Hematology/Oncology, HSK, Dr. Horst-Schmidt-Klinik, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Wurzburg University Medical Centre, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, CAST, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Ernst von Bergmann Hospital, Potsdam, Germany.', 'Bolzano Municipal Hospital, Bolzano, Italy.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Schleswig-Holstein University Hospital, Kiel Campus, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stauferklinikum Schwabisch Gmund, Mutlangen, Germany.', 'Department for Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pneumology, University Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Wurzburg University Medical Centre, Wurzburg, Germany. einsele_h@ukw.de.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190828,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/30 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0537-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0537-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Nov;33(11):2710-2719. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0537-2.

We analyzed clinical and molecular characteristics of 138 de novo AML patients with sole +4, +8, +11, +13 or +21, and compared them with AML patients with those trisomies occurring in addition to other chromosome abnormalities (non-sole trisomy) and with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. Mutations in methylation-related genes were most commonly observed within each sole trisomy group (+4, 55%; +8, 58%; +11, 71%; +13, 71%; +21, 75% of patients). Patients with sole trisomies, excluding +4, also had frequent mutations in spliceosome genes (+8, 43%; +11, 65%; +13, 65%; +21, 45% of patients). In contrast, +4 patients frequently had mutations in transcription factor genes (44%) and NPM1 (36%). While 48% of patients with sole trisomies harbored mutations in a spliceosome gene, spliceosome mutations were observed in only 24% of non-sole trisomy (n = 131, P < 0.001) and 19% of CN-AML patients (n = 716, P < 0.001).

The chromosomal deletion causes CSNK1A1 haplo-insufficiency. CK1alpha mutations have also been observed in a variety of solid and hematopoietic tumors at low frequency. The functional consequence of CK1alpha mutation remains unknown. Here we show that tumor-associated CK1alpha mutations exclusively localize to the substrate-binding cleft. Functional analysis of recurrent mutants E98K and D140A revealed enhanced binding to the p53 inhibitor MDMX, increased ability to stimulate MDMX-p53 binding, and increased suppression of p21 expression. Furthermore, E98K and D140A mutants have reduced ability to promote phosphorylation of beta-catenin, resulting in enhanced Wnt signaling. The results suggest that the CK1alpha mutations observed in tumors cause gain-of-function in cooperating with MDMX and inhibiting p53, and partial loss-of-function in suppressing Wnt signaling. These functional changes may promote expansion of abnormal myeloid progenitors in del(5q) MDS, and in rare cases drive the progression of other tumors.","['Liu, Xia', 'Huang, Qingling', 'Chen, Lihong', 'Zhang, Huilai', 'Schonbrunn, Ernst', 'Chen, Jiandong']","['Liu X', 'Huang Q', 'Chen L', 'Zhang H', 'Schonbrunn E', 'Chen J']",,"['Molecular Oncology Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, 33612, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, 300060, Tianjin, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, 33612, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Molecular Oncology Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, 33612, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, 300060, Tianjin, China.', 'Drug Discovery Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA.', 'Molecular Oncology Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, 33612, Tampa, FL, USA.

To systematically identify genes modulating chemotherapy response, we performed pooled functional genomic screens in HGSOC cell lines treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel, or cisplatin plus paclitaxel. Genes in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis were among the top candidate resistance genes in both gain-of-function and loss-of-function screens. In an open reading frame overexpression screen, followed by a mini-pool secondary screen, anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) and BCL2L2 (BCL-W) were associated with chemotherapy resistance. In a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, loss of BCL2L1 decreased cell survival whereas loss of proapoptotic genes promoted resistance. To dissect the role of individual anti-apoptotic proteins in HGSOC chemotherapy response, we evaluated overexpression or inhibition of BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, and MCL1 in HGSOC cell lines. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins decreased apoptosis and modestly increased cell viability upon cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment. Conversely, specific inhibitors of BCL-XL, MCL1, or BCL-XL/BCL-2, but not BCL-2 alone, enhanced cell death when combined with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Anti-apoptotic protein inhibitors also sensitized HGSOC cells to the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib. These unbiased screens highlight anti-apoptotic proteins as mediators of chemotherapy resistance in HGSOC, and support inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL1, alone or combined with chemotherapy or targeted agents, in treatment of primary and recurrent HGSOC. IMPLICATIONS: Anti-apoptotic proteins modulate drug resistance in ovarian cancer, and inhibitors of BCL-XL or MCL1 promote cell death in combination with chemotherapy.","['Stover, Elizabeth H', 'Baco, Maria B', 'Cohen, Ofir', 'Li, Yvonne Y', 'Christie, Elizabeth L', 'Bagul, Mukta', 'Goodale, Amy', 'Lee, Yenarae', 'Pantel, Sasha', 'Rees, Matthew G', 'Wei, Guo', 'Presser, Adam G', 'Gelbard, Maya K', 'Zhang, Weiqun', 'Zervantonakis, Ioannis K', 'Bhola, Patrick D', 'Ryan, Jeremy', 'Guerriero, Jennifer L', 'Montero, Joan', 'Liang, Felice J', 'Cherniack, Andrew D', 'Piccioni, Federica', 'Matulonis, Ursula A', 'Bowtell, David D L', 'Sarosiek, Kristopher A', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Garraway, Levi A', 'Johannessen, Cory M', 'Meyerson, Matthew']","['Stover EH', 'Baco MB', 'Cohen O', 'Li YY', 'Christie EL', 'Bagul M', 'Goodale A', 'Lee Y', 'Pantel S', 'Rees MG', 'Wei G', 'Presser AG', 'Gelbard MK', 'Zhang W', 'Zervantonakis IK', 'Bhola PD', 'Ryan J', 'Guerriero JL', 'Montero J', 'Liang FJ', 'Cherniack AD', 'Piccioni F', 'Matulonis UA', 'Bowtell DDL', 'Sarosiek KA', 'Letai A', 'Garraway LA', 'Johannessen CM', 'Meyerson M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6578-3216', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-7024', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2987-7581', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2386-9553', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3327-1283', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2104-5457', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0470-0111', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2618-1036']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Genetic Perturbation Platform, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Genetic Perturbation Platform, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Genetic Perturbation Platform, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Program, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'John B.

Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is an important constituent of licorice and possesses multiple bioactivities. In this study, we examined the selective anti-AML (acute myeloid leukemia) property of ISL via targeting FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), a certified valid target for treating AML. In vitro, ISL potently inhibited FLT3 kinase, with an IC50 value of 115.1 +/- 4.2 nM, and selectively inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) or FLT3-ITD/F691L mutant AML cells. Moreover, it showed very weak activity toward other tested cell lines or kinases. Western blot immunoassay revealed that ISL significantly inhibited the activation of FLT3/Erk1/2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signal in AML cells. Meanwhile, a molecular docking study indicated that ISL could stably form aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonds within the kinase domain of FLT3. In vivo, oral administration of ISL significantly inhibited the MV4-11 flank tumor growth and prolonged survival in the bone marrow transplant model via decreasing the expression of Ki67 and inducing apoptosis. Taken together, the present study identified a novel function of ISL as a selective FLT3 inhibitor. ISL could also be a potential natural bioactive compound for treating AML with FLT3-ITD or FLT3-ITD/F691L mutations. Thus, ISL and licorice might possess potential therapeutic effects for treating AML, providing a new strategy for anti-AML.","['Cao, Zhi-Xing', 'Wen, Yi', 'He, Jun-Lin', 'Huang, Shen-Zhen', 'Gao, Fei', 'Guo, Chuan-Jie', 'Liu, Qing-Qing', 'Zheng, Shu-Wen', 'Gong, Dao-Yin', 'Li, Yu-Zhi', 'Zhang, Ruo-Qi', 'Chen, Jian-Ping', 'Peng, Cheng']","['Cao ZX', 'Wen Y', 'He JL', 'Huang SZ', 'Gao F', 'Guo CJ', 'Liu QQ', 'Zheng SW', 'Gong DY', 'Li YZ', 'Zhang RQ', 'Chen JP', 'Peng C']",,"['Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China (Z.-X.C., J.-L.H., C.-J.G., S.-W.Z., D.-Y.G., Y.-Z.L., R.-Q.Z., J.-P.C., C.P.);School of Chinese Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China (Y.W., F.G., Q.-Q.L., J.-P.C.);

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of all reported front-line treatments for patients with newly diagnosed CML, a multiple-treatments meta-analysis was performed, which accounted for both direct and indirect comparisons among those treatments. METHODS: Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients achieving major molecular response (MMR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of progression to accelerated phase (AP), serious adverse effects (AEs), overall discontinuation and discontinuation for drug-related AEs. Direct pairwise meta-analysis and indirect multi-comparison meta-analysis among those treatments in each outcome were both conducted. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated for all treatments in each outcome. Cluster analysis demonstrated the division of treatments into distinct groupings according to efficacy and tolerability profiles. RESULTS: A total of 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs, including 10,187 patients) comparing 15 different interventions for CP-CML patients were included in this study. SUCRA analysis suggested that all tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly effective in newly diagnosed CP-CML when compared to traditional drugs. Newer TKIs and higher-dose imatinib generally resulted in faster cytogenetic and molecular responses when compared with standard-dose imatinib and traditional drugs. Furthermore, traditional drugs, higher-dose imatinib and newer TKIs demonstrated lower acceptability than standard-dose imatinib. One cluster of interventions, which included nilotinib (300/400 mg BID), dasatinib (100 mg QD) and radotinib (300 mg BID), demonstrated higher efficacy and tolerability than other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib (300/400 mg BID), dasatinib (100 mg QD) and radotinib (300 mg BID) prove to be the most recommended front-line treatments of the greatest efficacy and tolerability for CP-CML patients. High-dose therapies are recommended only for patients in accelerated phase/blast phase or with suboptimal CML-CP response, and management of adverse events should be carried out to avoid compromising the clinical efficacy.","['Tang, Lu', 'Zhang, Huan', 'Peng, Yi-Zhong', 'Li, Cheng-Gong', 'Jiang, Hui-Wen', 'Xu, Min', 'Mei, Heng', 'Hu, Yu']","['Tang L', 'Zhang H', 'Peng YZ', 'Li CG', 'Jiang HW', 'Xu M', 'Mei H', 'Hu Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-2443'],"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Instisute of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1227 Jiefang road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China.', 'Instisute of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1227 Jiefang road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430022,, Hubei, China. dr_huyu@126.com.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China. dr_huyu@126.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. dr_huyu@126.com.']",['eng'],"['No. 81770132/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 81570116/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 2018ACA141/the Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190828,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6714291,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Efficacy', 'Network meta-analysis', 'Tolerability', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2019/08/30 06:00,2020/01/21 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6039-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6039-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Aug 28;19(1):849. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6039-9.,20200120,849,,"['0', '(4-methyl-N-(3-(4-methylimidazol-1-yl)-5-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-(4-pyrazin-2-yl', 'pyrimidin-2-ylamino)benzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Network Meta-Analysis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although hESCs can indefinitely proliferate in culture, unlike transformed cancer cells, they are endowed with a cell-intrinsic property termed mitochondrial priming that renders them highly sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Thus, all attempts to broaden the insights into hESCs apoptosis may be helpful for establishing pro-survival strategies valuable for its in vitro culture and further use in clinical applications. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a family of serine/threonine protein kinases originally identified as regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle, can also regulate transcription and differentiation. Moreover, there are compelling data suggesting that its activities are involved in certain apoptotic programs in different cell types. Currently, it is not completely determined whether CDKs regulate apoptotic processes in rapidly proliferating and apoptosis-prone hESCs. In this study, to elucidate the effect of CDKs inhibition in hESCs we used Roscovitine (ROSC), a purine analogue that selectively inhibits the activities of these kinases. RESULTS: Inhibition of CDKs by ROSC triggers programmed cell death in hESCs but not in proliferating somatic cells (human fibroblasts). The apoptotic process encompasses caspase-9 and -3 activation followed by PARP cleavage. ROSC treatment also leads to p53 stabilization, which coincides with site-specific phosphorylation at serine 46 and decreased levels of Mdm2. Additionally, we observed a transcriptional induction of p53AIP1, a repression of pro-survival factor Mcl-1 and an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins NOXA and PUMA. Importantly, we found that the role of CDK2 inhibition appears to be at best accessory as an active CDK2 is not required to ensure hESCs survival. CONCLUSION: Our experimental data reveal that hESCs, contrary to fibroblasts, exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to ROSC.","['Videla-Richardson, Guillermo A', 'Furmento, Veronica A', 'Garcia, Carolina P', 'Morris-Hanon, Olivia', 'Sevlever, Gustavo E', 'Romorini, Leonardo', 'Scassa, Maria E']","['Videla-Richardson GA', 'Furmento VA', 'Garcia CP', 'Morris-Hanon O', 'Sevlever GE', 'Romorini L', 'Scassa ME']",,"['Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorios de Investigacion Aplicada en Neurociencias (LIAN-CONICET), Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia (FLENI), Belen de Escobar, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina. mescassa@fleni.org.ar.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190828,England,BMC Mol Cell Biol,BMC molecular and cell biology,101741148,PMC6712821,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cyclin-dependent kinases', '*Human embryonic stem cells', '*Roscovitine']",2019/08/30 06:00,2020/01/18 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12860-019-0222-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12860-019-0222-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Mol Cell Biol. 2019 Aug 28;20(1):40. doi: 10.1186/s12860-019-0222-3.,20200117,40,,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Human Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/chemistry/metabolism', 'Roscovitine/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast interactions with selectins expressed by vascular endothelium promote the development of drug resistance and leukostasis. While the role of selectins in initiating leukemia blast adhesion is established, our knowledge of the involved selectin ligands is incomplete. Using various primary acute leukemia cells and U937 monoblasts, we identified here functional selectin ligands expressed by myeloblasts and lymphoblasts by performing biochemical studies, expression inhibition by RNA interference and flow adhesion assays on recombinant selectins or selectin ligands immunoadsorbed from primary blast cells. Results demonstrate that P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is the major P-selectin ligand on myeloblasts, while it is much less frequently expressed and used by lymphoblasts to interact with endothelial selectins. To roll on E-selectin, myeloblasts use PSGL-1, CD44, and CD43 to various extents and the contribution of these ligands varies strongly among patients. In contrast, the interactions of PSGL-1-deficient lymphoblasts with E-selectin are mainly supported by CD43 and/or CD44. By identifying key selectin ligands expressed by acute leukemia blasts, this study offers novel insight into their involvement in mediating acute leukemia cell adhesion with vascular endothelium and may identify novel therapeutic targets.","['Spertini, Caroline', 'Baisse, Benedicte', 'Bellone, Marta', 'Gikic, Milica', 'Smirnova, Tatiana', 'Spertini, Olivier']","['Spertini C', 'Baisse B', 'Bellone M', 'Gikic M', 'Smirnova T', 'Spertini O']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1669-9421'],"['Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.

Methods: A total of 69 patients were enrolled in the clinical trial of CD(19) chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell treatment from February 2017 to October 2018. Study group received the modified cell infusion method, that 1x10(6) CAR-T cells were re-suspended in 2 mg human serum albumin with total volume of 20 ml and injected intravenously. The control group was intravenously administrated with CAR-T cell in 100 ml normal saline. The incidence of FNHTR, cytokine releasing syndrome (CRS) grade, cytokine level and efficacy were compared. Results: (1)The incidence of FNHTR in the study group was 21.1%, significantly lower than that in the control group (71%)(P=0.000). (2)There was no statistical difference in cell proliferation between the study group and the control group on day 4, 7, 14 and 21 after CAR-T cell infusion (P=10.223, 3.254, 5.551, 7.605). (3)There was no statistical difference in CRS grading between the study group and the control group (P=0.767). There was no statistical difference in the levels of interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha between the two groups. (4)The C-reaction protein (CRP) level of the study group was lower than that of the control group on day 4 and 7 (P=0.026, 0.007). (5)There was no statistical difference of response rates in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients between the two groups (P(ALL)=0.842; P(NHL)=0.866). Conclusion: The modified cell infusion method in CD(19) CAR-T cell treatment reduces the incidence of treatment-related FNHTR.

However, to date no intervention studies with OSM have been performed, and its relation to coronary heart disease (CHD) has not been studied. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Gene expression analysis on human normal arteries (n = 10) and late stage/advanced carotid atherosclerotic arteries (n = 127) and in situ hybridization on early human plaques (n = 9) showed that OSM, and its receptors, OSM receptor (OSMR) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) are expressed in normal arteries and atherosclerotic plaques. Chronic OSM administration in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice (n = 15/group) increased plasma E-selectin levels and monocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium independently of cholesterol but reduced the amount of inflammatory Ly-6CHigh monocytes and atherosclerotic lesion size and severity. Using aptamer-based proteomics profiling assays high circulating OSM levels were shown to correlate with post incident CHD survival probability in the AGES-Reykjavik study (n = 5457). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic OSM administration in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice reduced atherosclerosis development. In line, higher serum OSM levels were correlated with improved post incident CHD survival probability in patients, suggesting a protective cardiovascular effect.","['Keulen, Danielle van', 'Pouwer, Marianne G', 'Emilsson, Valur', 'Matic, Ljubica Perisic', 'Pieterman, Elsbet J', 'Hedin, Ulf', 'Gudnason, Vilmundur', 'Jennings, Lori L', 'Holmstrom, Kim', 'Nielsen, Boye Schnack', 'Pasterkamp, Gerard', 'Lindeman, Jan H N', 'van Gool, Alain J', 'Sollewijn Gelpke, Maarten D', 'Princen, Hans M G', 'Tempel, Dennie']","['Keulen DV', 'Pouwer MG', 'Emilsson V', 'Matic LP', 'Pieterman EJ', 'Hedin U', 'Gudnason V', 'Jennings LL', 'Holmstrom K', 'Nielsen BS', 'Pasterkamp G', 'Lindeman JHN', 'van Gool AJ', 'Sollewijn Gelpke MD', 'Princen HMG', 'Tempel D']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9657-871X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5696-0084', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0010-5286', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7206-1596', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8061-6483']","['Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Quorics B.V., Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'TNO-Metabolic Health Research, Gaubius Laboratory, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'TNO-Metabolic Health Research, Gaubius Laboratory, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Icelandic Heart Association, Kopavogur, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden.', 'TNO-Metabolic Health Research, Gaubius Laboratory, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden.', 'Icelandic Heart Association, Kopavogur, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Bioneer A/S, Horsholm, Denmark.', 'Bioneer A/S, Horsholm, Denmark.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'TNO- Microbiology & Systems Biology, Zeist, The Netherlands.', 'Molecular Profiling Consulting, London, United Kingdom.', 'TNO-Metabolic Health Research, Gaubius Laboratory, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Quorics B.V., Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'SkylineDx B.V., Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['N01 AG012100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190828,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6713386,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0221477 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-07169 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Aug 28;14(8):e0221477. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221477. eCollection 2019.,20200303,e0221477,,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (OSMR protein, human)', '0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/*metabolism', 'Atherosclerosis/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins/*metabolism', 'Coronary Disease/blood/genetics/mortality', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Oncostatin M/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Plaque, Atherosclerotic/genetics/pathology', 'Probability', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']","[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: Danielle van Keulen and Dennie Tempel are employed', 'by Quorics B.V., Maarten D Sollewijn Gelpke by Molecular Profiling Consulting,', 'Lori L Jennings by Novartis and Kim Holmstrom and Boye Schnack Nielsen PhD by', 'Bioneer A/S.

Solid tumors with low levels of intratumoral immune infiltration have inferior outcomes. It is unknown whether a similar relationship exists between POD24 in FL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Digital gene expression using a custom code set-five immune effector, six immune checkpoint, one macrophage molecules-was applied to a discovery cohort of patients with early- and advanced-stage FL (n = 132). T-cell receptor repertoire analysis, flow cytometry, multispectral immunofluorescence, and next-generation sequencing were performed. The immune infiltration profile was validated in two independent cohorts of patients with advanced-stage FL requiring systemic treatment (n = 138, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone; n = 45, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with the latter selected to permit comparison of patients experiencing a POD24 event with those having no progression at 5 years or more. RESULTS: Immune molecules showed distinct clustering, characterized by either high or low expression regardless of categorization as an immune effector, immune checkpoint, or macrophage molecule. Low programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) was the most sensitive/specific marker to segregate patients with adverse outcomes; therefore, PD-L2 expression was chosen to distinguish immune infiltration(HI) (ie, high PD-L2) FL biopsies from immune infiltration(LO) (ie, low PD-L2) tumors. Immune infiltration(HI) tissues were highly infiltrated with macrophages and expanded populations of T-cell clones. Of note, the immune infiltration(LO) subset of patients with FL was enriched for POD24 events (odds ratio [OR], 4.32; c-statistic, 0.81; P = .001), validated in the independent cohorts (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone: OR, 2.95; c-statistic, 0.75; P = .011; and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone: OR, 7.09; c-statistic, 0.88; P = .011). Mutations were equally proportioned across tissues, which indicated that degree of immune infiltration is capturing aspects of FL biology distinct from its mutational profile. CONCLUSION: Assessment of immune-infiltration by PD-L2 expression is a promising tool with which to help identify patients who are at risk for POD24.","['Tobin, Joshua W D', 'Keane, Colm', 'Gunawardana, Jay', 'Mollee, Peter', 'Birch, Simone', 'Hoang, Thanh', 'Lee, Justina', 'Li, Li', 'Huang, Li', 'Murigneux, Valentine', 'Fink, J Lynn', 'Matigian, Nicholas', 'Vari, Frank', 'Francis, Santiyagu', 'Kridel, Robert', 'Weigert, Oliver', 'Haebe, Sarah', 'Jurinovic, Vindi', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Sehn, Laurie H', 'Law, Soi-Cheng', 'Wykes, Michelle N', 'Gandhi, Maher K']","['Tobin JWD', 'Keane C', 'Gunawardana J', 'Mollee P', 'Birch S', 'Hoang T', 'Lee J', 'Li L', 'Huang L', 'Murigneux V', 'Fink JL', 'Matigian N', 'Vari F', 'Francis S', 'Kridel R', 'Weigert O', 'Haebe S', 'Jurinovic V', 'Klapper W', 'Steidl C', 'Sehn LH', 'Law SC', 'Wykes MN', 'Gandhi MK']",,"['Mater Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Mater Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Mater Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Ochsner Health System, New Orleans, LA.', 'Ochsner Health System, New Orleans, LA.', 'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Munich Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Munich Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Munich Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Mater Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Mater Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Webcast']",20190828,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC6881104,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.02365 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Dec 1;37(34):3300-3309. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.02365.

We show how a cure proportion model can be used to get the necessary number of events and appropriate timing via simulation. If phase 1 results for the new drug are exceptional and/or the medical need in the target population is high, a phase 3 trial might be initiated after phase 1. Building in a futility interim analysis into such a pivotal trial may mitigate the uncertainty of moving directly to phase 3. However, if cure is possible, overall survival might not be mature enough at the interim to support a futility decision. We propose to base this decision on an intermediate endpoint that is sufficiently associated with survival. Planning for such an interim can be interpreted as making a randomized phase 2 trial a part of the pivotal trial: If stopped at the interim, the trial data would be analyzed, and a decision on a subsequent phase 3 trial would be made. If the trial continues at the interim, then the phase 3 trial is already underway. To select a futility boundary, a mechanistic simulation model that connects the intermediate endpoint and survival is proposed. We illustrate how this approach was used to design a pivotal randomized trial in acute myeloid leukemia and discuss historical data that informed the simulation model and operational challenges when implementing it.","['Rufibach, Kaspar', 'Heinzmann, Dominik', 'Monnet, Annabelle']","['Rufibach K', 'Heinzmann D', 'Monnet A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2634-1167'],"['Methods, Collaboration, and Outreach Group (MCO), Department of Biostatistics, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Biostatistics, Department of Biostatistics, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Biostatistics, Department of Biostatistics, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190828,England,Pharm Stat,Pharmaceutical statistics,101201192,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cure proportion', '*futility interim analysis', '*integrate phase 2', '*intermediate endpoint', '*randomized clinical trial']",2019/08/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pst.1969 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Stat. 2020 Jan;19(1):44-58. doi: 10.1002/pst.1969.

Because apart from showing anticancer activity, anthracyclines and their analogues also show cardiotoxic side effects, believed to be addressed through metal complex formation; an effort was made to realize this by preparing a Co(II) complex of THAQ. The aim of this study was to find out if complex formation leads to a decrease in the generation of intermediates that are responsible for toxic side effects. However, because this also meant that efficacy on cancer cells would be compromised, studies were undertaken on two cancer cell lines, namely, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) MOLT-4 and HCT116 cells. The complex decreases the flow of electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen (O2) in the presence of NADH dehydrogenase forming less semiquinone than THAQ. It showed increased affinity toward DNA with binding constant values remaining constant over the physiological pH range unlike THAQ (for which decrease in binding constant values with increase in pH was observed). The complex is probably a human DNA topoisomerase I and human DNA topoisomerase II poison acting by stabilizing the covalent topoisomerase-cleaved DNA adduct, a phenomenon not observed for THAQ. Activity of the compounds on cancer cells suggests that THAQ was more effective on ALL MOLT-4 cells, whereas the complex performed better on HCT116 cells. Results suggest that the formation of semiquinone probably dominates the action because of THAQ, whereas the performance of the complex is attributed to increased DNA binding, inhibition of topoisomerase, and so forth. Inspite of a decrease in the generation of superoxide by the complex, it did not hamper efficacy on either cell line, probably compensated by improved DNA binding and inhibition of topoisomerase enzymes which are positive attributes of complex formation. A decrease in superoxide formation suggests that the complex could be less cardiotoxic, thus increasing its therapeutic index.","['Mukherjee Chatterjee, Sayantani', 'Jain, Chetan Kumar', 'Singha, Soumen', 'Das, Piyal', 'Roychoudhury, Susanta', 'Majumder, Hemanta Kumar', 'Das, Saurabh']","['Mukherjee Chatterjee S', 'Jain CK', 'Singha S', 'Das P', 'Roychoudhury S', 'Majumder HK', 'Das S']",,"['Department of Chemistry (Inorganic Section) and Department of Physics, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Department of Chemistry (Inorganic Section) and Department of Physics, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Department of Chemistry (Inorganic Section) and Department of Physics, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Department of Chemistry (Inorganic Section) and Department of Physics, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180830,United States,ACS Omega,ACS omega,101691658,PMC6644896,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2019/08/29 06:01,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsomega.8b00706 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Omega. 2018 Aug 30;3(8):10255-10266. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.8b00706. eCollection 2018 Aug 31.,,10255-10266,,,,,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the uptake of F'-[W9R8K] was shown to be temperature-dependent and slightly adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent.

Detecting FMOD in CLL patients using specific anti-FMOD mAbs might provide a promising method in detection, monitoring, and prognosis of CLL. Objectives: In this study, we aimed for producing specific antibodies against FMOD to facilitate further cohort study of CLL, thus addressing FMOD as a potential target of detection. Materials and Methods: Human FMOD gene (1087 bp) was extracted from genome of the CLL patients, and was cloned into the expression vector of pET-22b (+). The recombinant FMOD protein (rFMOD) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified rFMOD protein was used as an immunogen in rabbit and mice. Hybridoma technology was used to develop the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Polyclonal antibody (pAb) was purified from the rabbit sera using affinity column. The reactivity of anti-FMOD antibodies was assessed in ELISA, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blot. Results: ICC results showed that the anti-FMOD antibodies specifically detected FMOD in CLL PBMCs and cell lines. The developed anti-FMOD pAb detected FMOD in CLL lysates, compared to healthy PBMCs, in Western blot and ELISA. Conclusions: The developed anti-FMOD mAbs, and pAb specifically detect FMOD in CLL samples and might be used as research tools for further investigations in CLL.","['Farahi, Lia', 'Ghaemimanesh, Fatemeh', 'Milani, Saeideh', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Bayat, Ali Ahmad', 'Rabbani, Hodjattallah', 'Akhondi, Mohammad Mehdi']","['Farahi L', 'Ghaemimanesh F', 'Milani S', 'Razavi SM', 'Bayat AA', 'Rabbani H', 'Akhondi MM']",,"['Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Firoozgar Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190111,Iran,Iran J Biotechnol,Iranian journal of biotechnology,101276796,PMC6697857,['NOTNLM'],"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Fibromodulin', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell']",2019/08/29 06:00,2019/08/29 06:01,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.21859/ijb.2277 [doi]'],epublish,Iran J Biotechnol. 2019 Jan 11;17(1):e2277. doi: 10.21859/ijb.2277. eCollection 2019 Jan.,,e2277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study builds on this work, showing for the first time that all four DENV serotypes elicit PML-NB breakdown. Importantly, we show for the first time that of the nuclear localizing proteins of DENV, DENV non-structural protein (NS) 5 polymerase alone is sufficient to elicit PML-NB disassembly, in part through complexing with PML isoforms III and IV, but not other PML isoforms or other PML-NB components. The results raise the possibility that PML-NB disruption by nuclear localized NS5 contributes to DENV's suppression of the host antiviral response.","['Giovannoni, Federico', 'Ladelfa, Maria Fatima', 'Monte, Martin', 'Jans, David A', 'Hemmerich, Peter', 'Garcia, Cybele']","['Giovannoni F', 'Ladelfa MF', 'Monte M', 'Jans DA', 'Hemmerich P', 'Garcia C']",,"['Laboratorio de Estrategias Antivirales, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Quimica Bioologica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Quimica Bioologica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Quimica Bioologica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Infection and Immunity Program, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Jena, Germany.', 'Laboratorio de Estrategias Antivirales, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Quimica Bioologica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190813,Switzerland,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,101585359,PMC6701172,['NOTNLM'],"['*PML isoform', '*PML-NBs disruption', '*dengue virus', '*non-structural protein 5 polymerase', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein']",2019/08/29 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcimb.2019.00284 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2019 Aug 13;9:284. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2019.00284. eCollection 2019.,20200714,284,,"['0 (NS5 protein, dengue virus)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Dengue/*metabolism/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Transport', 'Serogroup', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to determine whether measuring BCR-ABL1 mRNA doubling-times (DTs) could distinguish inconsequential rises in the oncogene's expression from resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Thus, we retrospectively examined BCR-ABL1 evolution in 305 chronic-phase CML patients receiving imatinib mesylate (IM) as a first line treatment. Patients were subdivided in two groups: those with a confirmed rise in BCR-ABL1 transcripts without MR(3.0) loss and those failing IM. We found that the DTs of the former patients were significantly longer than those of patients developing IM resistance (57.80 vs. 41.45 days, p = 0.0114). Interestingly, the DT values of individuals failing second-generation (2G) TKIs after developing IM resistance were considerably shorter than those observed at the time of IM failure (27.20 vs. 41.45 days; p = 0.0035). We next wanted to establish if decreases in BCR-ABL1 transcripts would identify subjects likely to obtain deep molecular responses. We therefore analyzed the BCR-ABL1 halving-times (HTs) of a different cohort comprising 174 individuals receiving IM in first line and observed that, regardless of the time point selected for our analyses (6, 12, or 18 months), HTs were significantly shorter in subjects achieving superior molecular responses (p = 0.002 at 6 months; p < 0.001 at 12 months; p = 0.0099 at 18 months). Moreover, 50 patients receiving 2G TKIs as first line therapy and obtaining an MR(3.0) (after 6 months; p = 0.003) or an MR(4.0) (after 12 months; p = 0.019) displayed significantly shorter HTs than individuals lacking these molecular responses. Our findings suggest that BCR-ABL1 DTs and HTs are reliable tools to, respectively, identify subjects in MR(3.0) that are failing their assigned TKI or to recognize patients likely to achieve deep molecular responses that should be considered for treatment discontinuation.","['Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Di Gregorio, Sandra', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Antolino, Agostino', 'Siragusa, Sergio', 'Mannina, Donato', 'Impera, Stefana', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Mineo, Giuseppe', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Zammit, Valentina', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Vigneri, Paolo']","['Pennisi MS', 'Stella S', 'Vitale SR', 'Puma A', 'Di Gregorio S', 'Romano C', 'Tirro E', 'Massimino M', 'Antolino A', 'Siragusa S', 'Mannina D', 'Impera S', 'Musolino C', 'Mineo G', 'Martino B', 'Zammit V', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Manzella L', 'Stagno F', 'Vigneri P']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria (A.O.U.)

Due to this rarity, little is known about the prognosis of these patients. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors for this cohort. We identified 283 patients in the EUTOS population-based and out-study registries that were diagnosed in advanced phase. Nearly all patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Median survival in this heterogeneous cohort was 8.2 years. When comparing patients with more than 30% blasts to those with 20-29% blasts, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.32 (95%-confidence interval (CI): [0.7-2.6]). Patients with 20-29% blasts had a significantly higher risk than patients with less than 20% blasts (HR: 2.24, 95%-CI: [1.2-4.0], P = .008). We found that the blast count was the most important prognostic factor; however, age, hemoglobin, basophils and other chromosomal aberrations should be considered as well. The ELTS score was able to define two groups (high risk vs non-high risk) with an HR of 3.01 (95%-CI: [1.81-5.00], P < .001). Regarding the contrasting definitions of blast crisis, our data clearly supported the 20% cut-off over the 30% cut-off in this cohort. Based on our results, we conclude that a one-phase rather than a two-phase categorization of de novo advanced phase CML patients is appropriate.","['Lauseker, Michael', 'Bachl, Katharina', 'Turkina, Anna', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Prejzner, Witold', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Lomaia, Elza', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Schubert-Fritschle, Gabriele', 'Sacha, Tomasz', 'Heibl, Sonja', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Hoffmann, Verena S', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Pfirrmann, Markus']","['Lauseker M', 'Bachl K', 'Turkina A', 'Faber E', 'Prejzner W', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Baccarani M', 'Lomaia E', 'Zackova D', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Griskevicius L', 'Schubert-Fritschle G', 'Sacha T', 'Heibl S', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Clark RE', 'Guilhot J', 'Hoffmann VS', 'Hasford J', 'Hochhaus A', 'Pfirrmann M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6662-7127', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7207-6595']","['Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Medical Science and Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology L. and A, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Clinical oncology - Research department of oncology and hematology, Almazov Medical Research Center, St Petersburg, Russian Federation.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos and Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Munich Cancer Registry, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Chair and Department of Hematology, Jagiellonian University Hospital, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department for Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.', 'Helsinki University Hospital Cancer Center and Hematology Research Unit, Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Clinic of Hematology CCS and Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Clinical Investigation Center, INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190914,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25628 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Nov;94(11):1236-1243. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25628.

Results from MLPA and cytogenetics were compared between groups according to the type of abnormality found on chromosome 21. Out the group of 235 patients, chromosome 21 multiplication was found by FISH assay in 56 cases (23.81%), ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in 34 (14.47%) and iAMP21 in 3 (1.28%) children, remaining 142 (60.43%) patients had no known chromosome 21 aberration.

This study analyzed combined findings from a targeted literature review with patient-reported information shared on YouTube to further understand patient perspectives in hematologic cancers and, in particular, acute myeloid leukemia. The targeted literature review included articles concerning patient (aged >/= 18 years) experiences or perspectives in acute myeloid leukemia or other hematologic cancers. YouTube video selection criteria included patients (aged >/= 60 years) with self-reported acute myeloid leukemia. In total, 26 articles (13 acute myeloid leukemia-specific and 14 other hematologic cancers, with one relevant to both populations) and 28 videos pertaining to ten unique patients/caregivers were identified. Key concepts reported by patients included the perceived value of survival for achieving personal and/or life milestones, the emotional/psychological distress of their diagnosis, and the uncertainties about life expectancy/prognosis. Effective therapies that could potentially delay progression and extend life were of great importance to patients; however, these were considered in terms of quality-of-life impact and disruption to daily life. Many patients expressed concerns regarding the lack of treatment options, the possibility of side effects, and how their diagnosis and treatment would affect relationships, daily lives, and ability to complete certain tasks. Both data sources yielded valuable and rich information on the patient experience and perceptions of hematologic cancers, in particular for acute myeloid leukemia, and its treatments. Further understanding of these insights could aid discussions between clinicians, patients, and their caregivers regarding treatment decisions, highlight outcomes of importance to patients in clinical studies, and ultimately, inform patient-focused drug development and evaluation.","['Crawford, Rebecca', 'Sully, Kate', 'Conroy, Rebecca', 'Johnson, Chloe', 'Doward, Lynda', 'Bell, Timothy', 'Welch, Verna', 'Peloquin, Francois', 'Gater, Adam']","['Crawford R', 'Sully K', 'Conroy R', 'Johnson C', 'Doward L', 'Bell T', 'Welch V', 'Peloquin F', 'Gater A']",,"['RTI Health Solutions, Didsbury, Manchester, UK.', 'Adelphi Values Ltd, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Didsbury, Manchester, UK.', 'Adelphi Values Ltd, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Didsbury, Manchester, UK.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA. timothy.j.bell@pfizer.com.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA.', 'Pfizer Canada Inc, Kirkland, QC, Canada.', 'Adelphi Values Ltd, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Patient,The patient,101309314,PMC6957575,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40271-019-00384-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40271-019-00384-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Patient. 2020 Feb;13(1):83-102. doi: 10.1007/s40271-019-00384-9.,20210119,83-102,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Caregivers/psychology', '*Decision Making, Shared', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Participation/*psychology', 'Patient-Centered Care/organization & administration', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/epidemiology/psychology', 'Uncertainty']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, 55'668 deaths in 114'491 patients with HSCT (83.7% allogeneic) for leukemia were investigated in a landmark analysis for causes of death at day 30 (very early), day 100 (early), at 1 year (intermediate) and at 5 years (late). Mortality from all causes decreased from cohort 1 (1980-2001) to cohort 2 (2002-2015) in all post-transplant phases after autologous HSCT. After allogeneic HSCT, mortality from infections, GVHD, and toxicity decreased up to 1 year, increased at 5 years; deaths from relapse increased in all post-transplant phases. Infections of unknown origin were the main cause of infectious deaths. Lethal bacterial and fungal infections decreased from cohort 1 to cohort 2, not unknown or mixed infections. Infectious deaths were associated with patient-, disease-, donor type, stem cell source, center, and country- related factors. Their impact varied over the post-transplant phases.

The goal of therapy for such patients is therefore to achieve disease control with acceptable toxicity and patient-defined decent quality of life. Physicians face a difficult task not only deciding who to treat, but also when to treat and how to treat, utilizing knowledge of previously administered therapies, patient comorbidities, potential adverse events, and patient wishes to make such a critical decision. New drugs and combination regimens are continuously underway thus broadening the options for therapy and giving way to a more individualized approach for patients with RRMM. The integration of novel agents into the treatment paradigm has shifted the perception of multiple myeloma (MM) from an incurable, fatal disease to a manageable, chronic one. This comprehensive review addresses the results and challenges posed by many of the newer agents for the treatment of RRMM. It attempts to propose a universal strategy for optimal therapy decision-making thus answering three simple fundamental questions-when to treat, how to treat, and how long to treat for.","['Bazarbachi, Abdul Hamid', 'Al Hamed, Rama', 'Malard, Florent', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi AH', 'Al Hamed R', 'Malard F', 'Harousseau JL', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0243-4040', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3474-0002']","[""Service d'hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, INSERM UMRs 938, and universite Sorbonne, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, INSERM UMRs 938, and universite Sorbonne, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, INSERM UMRs 938, and universite Sorbonne, Paris, France."", ""Institut de Cancerologie de l'Ouest, Centre Rene Gauducheau, Nantes-St Herblain, France."", ""Service d'hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, INSERM UMRs 938, and universite Sorbonne, Paris, France. mohamad.mohty@inserm.fr.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190827,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0561-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0561-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2343-2357. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0561-2.

Resistance to TK inhibitor (TKI) therapy occurs in relatively few patients, no more than 10%, while persistence of minimal residual disease during TKI therapy occurs in the great majority of patients. Resistance is a cause of death, persistence is compatible with a fairly normal length and quality of life, but may require lifelong treatment. The causes of resistance are heterogeneous, including the development of other genomic abnormalities or the altered expression of other genes, requiring different treatments. The causes of persistence may not be the same as those of resistance. We hypothesize that the variability in breakpoint position within the Major-breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr), resulting in two different messenger RNAs that may or may not include exon 14 of BCR (e13a2 and e14a2, respectively), and, as a consequence, in two p210(BCR-ABL1) proteins that differ by 25 amino acids, may be a cause of persistence. The hypothesis is based on a critical review of the relationships between the BCR-ABL1 transcript types, the response to TKIs, the outcome of treatment, and the immune response, suggesting that the e14a2 transcript is associated with more and deeper molecular responses, hence with a higher probability of achieving treatment-free remission (TFR). Investigating this putative cause of persistence may help bringing more patients into stable TFR.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Soverini, Simona']","['Baccarani M', 'Rosti G', 'Soverini S']",,"['Institute of Hematology ""Lorenzo and Ariosto Seragnoli"", Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, S.Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. michele.baccarani@unibo.it.', 'Institute of Hematology ""Lorenzo and Ariosto Seragnoli"", Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, S.Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology ""Lorenzo and Ariosto Seragnoli"", Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, S.Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190827,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0562-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0562-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2358-2364. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0562-1.

AML is primarily diagnosed among the elderly (median 68 years old at diagnosis). Prognoses have significantly improved for younger patients, but as much as 70% of patients over 60 years old will die within a year of diagnosis. In this study, we conducted a reanalysis of 2,213 acute myeloid leukemia patients compared to 548 healthy individuals, using curated publicly available microarray gene expression data. We carried out an analysis of normalized batch corrected data, using a linear model that included considerations for disease, age, sex, and tissue. We identified 974 differentially expressed probe sets and 4 significant pathways associated with AML. Additionally, we identified 375 age- and 70 sex-related probe set expression signatures relevant to AML. Finally, we trained a k nearest neighbors model to classify AML and healthy subjects with 90.9% accuracy. Our findings provide a new reanalysis of public datasets, that enabled the identification of new gene sets relevant to AML that can potentially be used in future experiments and possible stratified disease diagnostics.","['Roushangar, Raeuf', 'Mias, George I']","['Roushangar R', 'Mias GI']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9083-1216'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. gmias@msu.edu.', 'Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. gmias@msu.edu.']",['eng'],['R00 HG007065/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190827,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6712049,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-48872-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-48872-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 27;9(1):12413. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-48872-0.,20201021,12413,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Transcriptome', 'United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sorafenib was administered concurrently or sequentially with clofarabine and cytarabine to patients with leukemia or with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide to patients with solid tumor malignancies. The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of sorafenib and its metabolites and skin toxicities were evaluated. RESULTS: In PPK analysis, older age, bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide regimen, and higher creatinine were associated with decreased sorafenib apparent clearance (CL/f; P < 0.0001 for all), and concurrent clofarabine and cytarabine administration was associated with decreased sorafenib N-oxide CL/f (P = 7e-4). Higher bilirubin was associated with decreased sorafenib N-oxide and glucuronide CL/f (P = 1e-4). Concurrent use of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 inhibitors was associated with increased sorafenib and decreased sorafenib glucuronide CL/f (P < 0.003). In exposure-toxicity analysis, a shorter time to development of grade 2-3 hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) was associated with concurrent (P = 0.0015) but not with sequential (P = 0.59) clofarabine and cytarabine administration, compared with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide, and with higher steady-state concentrations of sorafenib (P = 0.0004) and sorafenib N-oxide (P = 0.0275). In the Bayes information criterion model selection, concurrent clofarabine and cytarabine administration, higher sorafenib steady-state concentrations, larger body surface area, and previous occurrence of rash appeared in the four best two-predictor models of HFSR. Pharmacokinetic simulations showed that once-daily and every-other-day sorafenib schedules would minimize exposure to sorafenib steady-state concentrations associated with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib skin toxicities can be affected by concurrent medications and sorafenib steady-state concentrations. The described PPK model can be used to refine exposure-response relations for alternative dosing strategies to minimize skin toxicity.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Panetta, John C', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Wang, Lei', 'Li, Lie', 'Navid, Fariba', 'Federico, Sara M', 'Eisenmann, Eric D', 'Vasilyeva, Aksana', 'Wang, Yong-Dong', 'Shurtleff, Sheila', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Inaba H', 'Panetta JC', 'Pounds SB', 'Wang L', 'Li L', 'Navid F', 'Federico SM', 'Eisenmann ED', 'Vasilyeva A', 'Wang YD', 'Shurtleff S', 'Pui CH', 'Gruber TA', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Baker SD']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8751-9216', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1176-675X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8751-9216']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', ""Cancer Center Administration, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138744/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190827,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC6911639,,,2019/08/29 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-0470 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0470 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Dec 15;25(24):7320-7330. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0470.

Examining determinants and time trends in diagnostic routes can help to appreciate the critical role of general practice over time in diagnostic pathways for patients with cancer. AIM: To examine sociodemographic, cancer site, and temporal associations with type of presentation among patients with cancer diagnosed as emergencies. DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of Routes to Diagnosis data, 2006-2015, for patients with cancer in England. METHOD: The authors estimated adjusted proportions of emergency presentation after emergency GP referral (GP-EP) or presentation to accident and emergency (AE-EP), by patient sex, age, deprivation group, and year of diagnosis using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Among 554 621 patients presenting as emergencies, 24% (n = 130 372) presented as GP-EP, 62% as AE-EP (n = 346 192), and 14% (n = 78 057) through Other-EP sub-routes. Patients presenting as emergencies were more likely to have been GP-referred if they lived in less deprived areas or were subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic, gallbladder, or ovarian cancer, or acute leukaemia. During the study period the proportion and number of GP-EPs nearly halved (31%, n = 17 364, in 2006; 17%, n = 9155 in 2015), while that of AE-EP increased (55%, n = 31 049 to 68%, n = 36 868). CONCLUSION: Patients presenting as emergencies with cancers characterised by symptoms/signs tolerable by patients but appropriately alarming to doctors (for example, pancreatic cancer manifesting as painless jaundice) are over-represented among cases whose emergency presentation involved GP referral. Reductions in diagnoses of cancer through an emergency presentation likely reflect both the continually increasing use of 2-week-wait GP referrals during the study period and reductions in emergency GP referrals.","['Herbert, Annie', 'Abel, Gary A', 'Winters, Sam', 'McPhail, Sean', 'Elliss-Brookes, Lucy', 'Lyratzopoulos, Georgios']","['Herbert A', 'Abel GA', 'Winters S', 'McPhail S', 'Elliss-Brookes L', 'Lyratzopoulos G']",,"['MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol; formerly at Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare and Outcomes (ECHO) Group, University College London, London; National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Public Health England, London.', 'University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care), Exeter; National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Public Health England, London.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Public Health England, London.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Public Health England, London.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Public Health England, London.', 'Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare and Outcomes (ECHO) Group, University College London, London; National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Public Health England, London.']",['eng'],['CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190926,England,Br J Gen Pract,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,9005323,PMC6713517,['NOTNLM'],"['*early diagnosis', '*emergencies', '*patients', '*population groups', '*referral and consultation']",2019/08/29 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjgp19X705473 [pii]', '10.3399/bjgp19X705473 [doi]']",epublish,Br J Gen Pract. 2019 Sep 26;69(687):e724-e730. doi: 10.3399/bjgp19X705473.

Although BLV is highly prevalent in China, information about the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of BLV among Chinese dairy herds is still lacking. To determine the genetic variability of BLV, 219 cows from four cities of Ningxia province of China were screened for BLV infection by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-PCR and sequencing, 16 selected positive samples were subjected to molecular characterization. Phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method on complete sequences of envelope (env) gene of BLV obtained from China and those available in GenBank (representing BLV genotypes 1-10) revealed that those Chinese strains belonged to genotypes 4 and 6. Totally, 23 mutations were identified and 16 of them were determined to be unique mutations among Chinese strains. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences demonstrated six mutations in glycoprotein 51 (gp51) and three mutations in glycoprotein 30 (gp30) located in the identified neutralizing domain (ND), CD8(+) T cell epitope, E-epitope, B-epitope, gp51N12 and cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane protein. This study reported for the first time the BLV genotype 4 in China, and further studies are warranted to compare its immunogenicity and pathogenicity with other BLV genotypes.","['Yang, Yi', 'Chen, Lina', 'Dong, Maoli', 'Huang, Wenjiang', 'Hao, Xiaoli', 'Peng, Yalan', 'Gong, Zaicheng', 'Qin, Aijian', 'Shang, Shaobin', 'Yang, Zhangping']","['Yang Y', 'Chen L', 'Dong M', 'Huang W', 'Hao X', 'Peng Y', 'Gong Z', 'Qin A', 'Shang S', 'Yang Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4407-1911'],"['Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'International Corporation Laboratory of Agriculture and Agricultural Products Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Victor Pharmaceutical Company of Limited Liability, Zhenjiang, 212132, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'International Corporation Laboratory of Agriculture and Agricultural Products Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China. shaobinshang@yzu.edu.cn.', 'International Corporation Laboratory of Agriculture and Agricultural Products Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China. shaobinshang@yzu.edu.cn.', 'International Corporation Laboratory of Agriculture and Agricultural Products Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China. yzp@yzu.edu.cn.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China. yzp@yzu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190827,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,PMC6712836,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Envelope gene', '*Genetic diversity', '*Molecular characterization']",2019/08/29 06:00,2019/12/20 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-019-1207-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-019-1207-8 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2019 Aug 27;16(1):108. doi: 10.1186/s12985-019-1207-8.,20191219,108,,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*virology', 'China', 'Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genes, env', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,

YKL-40, expressed in granulocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes and malignant cells, is an acute phase reactant with an important role in tissue remodeling and atherosclerotic inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate serum YKL-40 levels in MPNs and to assess its clinical correlations. Methods: ELISA test was used to measure serum YKL-40 levels in 111 MPN patients and in 32 healthy controls. Results: Serum YKL-40 levels were higher in ET, post-ET MF, PV, post-PV MF and primary MF patients, when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). Higher serum YKL-40 levels were associated with parameters indicative of the increased inflammatory state (higher C-reactive protein, poor performance status, presence of constitutional symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors). Additionally, higher serum YKL-40 levels in MF patients were associated with blast phase disease, lower hemoglobin and higher Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System score. In the multivariate Cox regression models, higher serum YKL-40 levels in ET and PV patients were independently associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (HR 4.64, p = 0.031) and impaired survival in MF patients (HR 4.31, p = 0.038). Conclusion: These results indicate that higher circulating YKL-40 levels in MPNs might have a pathophysiological role in disease progression and thrombosis development. Assessing circulating YKL-40 could help in identification of ET and PV patients at a high risk of future cardiovascular events and has a good potential for improving prognostication of MF patients.","['Krecak, Ivan', 'Gveric-Krecak, Velka', 'Lapic, Ivana', 'Roncevic, Pavle', 'Gulin, Josipa', 'Fumic, Ksenija', 'Krecak, Filip', 'Holik, Hrvoje', 'Durakovic, Nadira']","['Krecak I', 'Gveric-Krecak V', 'Lapic I', 'Roncevic P', 'Gulin J', 'Fumic K', 'Krecak F', 'Holik H', 'Durakovic N']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8642-305X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0854-4526']","['Department of Internal Medicine, General Hospital of Sibenik-Knin County , Sibenik, Croatia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, General Hospital of Sibenik-Knin County , Sibenik, Croatia.', 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics of Inborn Errors of Metabolism, Clinical Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics of Inborn Errors of Metabolism, Clinical Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Split , Split, Croatia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, ""Dr. Josip Bencevic"" General Hospital , Slavonski Brod, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Center Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190827,England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,,['NOTNLM'],"['YKL-40', 'essential thrombocythemia', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'polycythemia vera']",2019/08/29 06:00,2019/08/29 06:00,['2019/08/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17843286.2019.1659467 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 2021 Feb;76(1):32-39. doi: 10.1080/17843286.2019.1659467.

The multiplicity of the drug resistance determinants raises the question about the optimal strategies to deal with them. Essential oils showed to inhibit the growth of different tumor cell types. Essential oils contain several chemical classes of compounds whose heterogeneity of active moieties can help prevent the development of drug resistance. In the present paper, we analyzed, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry the chemical composition of the essential oil of the leaves of Kalanchoe beharensis obtained by hydrodistillation and compared the chemical composition of its essential oil with that of Cyphostemma juttae. Our results demonstrated the anticancer and proapoptotic activities of both species against acute myeloid leukemia on an in vitro model and its multidrug resistant variant involving NF-kappaB pathway.

There are marked differences in drug dosing and scheduling depending on the protocols when treating AML patients with AraC. Large inter-patient pharmacokinetics variability has been reported, and genetic polymorphisms affecting cytidine deaminase (CDA), the liver enzyme responsible for the conversion of Ara-C to inactive uracil arabinoside (AraU) could be a culprit for either life-threatening toxicities or poor efficacy related to substantial changes in plasma exposure levels among patients. The quantitative determination of Ara-C in plasma is challenging due the required sensitivity because of the short half-life of this drug (i.e., <10min) and the metabolic instability in biological matrix upon sampling possibly resulting in erratic values. We developed and validated a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (UPLC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of Ara-C and Ara-U metabolite in human plasma. After simple and rapid precipitation, analytes were successfully separated and quantitated over a 1-500ng/ml range for Ara-C and 250-7500ng/ml range for AraU. The performance and reliability of this method was tested as part of an investigational study in AML patients treated with low dose cytarabine and confirmed marked differences in drug exposure levels and metabolic ratio, depending on the CDA status of the patients. Overall, this new method meets the requirements of current bioanalytical guidelines and could be used to monitor drug levels in AML patients with respect to their CDA phenotypes.","['Donnette, Melanie', 'Solas, Caroline', 'Giocanti, Madeleine', 'Venton, Geoffroy', 'Farnault, Laure', 'Berda-Haddad, Yael', 'Hau, Le Thi Thu', 'Costello, Regis', ""Ouafik, L'Houcine"", 'Lacarelle, Bruno', 'Ciccolini, Joseph', 'Fanciullino, Raphaelle']","['Donnette M', 'Solas C', 'Giocanti M', 'Venton G', 'Farnault L', 'Berda-Haddad Y', 'Hau LTT', 'Costello R', 'Ouafik L', 'Lacarelle B', 'Ciccolini J', 'Fanciullino R']",,"['SMARTc: Simulation & Modeling: Adaptative Response for Therapeutics in Cancer, CRCM Inserm UMR 1068 CNRS Faculte de Pharmacie de Marseille, 27 boulevard Jean-Moulin, 13385 Marseille, France.', 'SMARTc: Simulation & Modeling: Adaptative Response for Therapeutics in Cancer, CRCM Inserm UMR 1068 CNRS Faculte de Pharmacie de Marseille, 27 boulevard Jean-Moulin, 13385 Marseille, France; Laboratoire de Pharmacocinetique et Toxicologie, La Timone University Hospital of Marseille, 264 rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille Cedex 5, France.', 'Laboratoire de Pharmacocinetique et Toxicologie, La Timone University Hospital of Marseille, 264 rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille Cedex 5, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception University hospital of Marseille, 147 Boulevard Baille, 13005 Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception University hospital of Marseille, 147 Boulevard Baille, 13005 Marseille, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Medicale, La Conception University Hospital of Marseille, 147 Boulevard Baille, 13005 Marseille, France.', 'SMARTc: Simulation & Modeling: Adaptative Response for Therapeutics in Cancer, CRCM Inserm UMR 1068 CNRS Faculte de Pharmacie de Marseille, 27 boulevard Jean-Moulin, 13385 Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception University hospital of Marseille, 147 Boulevard Baille, 13005 Marseille, France.', 'Laboratoire de Transfert en Oncologie Biologie, Nord University Hospital of Marseille, Chemin des Bourrely, 13915 Marseille cedex 20, France.', 'Laboratoire de Pharmacocinetique et Toxicologie, La Timone University Hospital of Marseille, 264 rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille Cedex 5, France.', 'SMARTc: Simulation & Modeling: Adaptative Response for Therapeutics in Cancer, CRCM Inserm UMR 1068 CNRS Faculte de Pharmacie de Marseille, 27 boulevard Jean-Moulin, 13385 Marseille, France; Laboratoire de Pharmacocinetique et Toxicologie, La Timone University Hospital of Marseille, 264 rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille Cedex 5, France.', 'SMARTc: Simulation & Modeling: Adaptative Response for Therapeutics in Cancer, CRCM Inserm UMR 1068 CNRS Faculte de Pharmacie de Marseille, 27 boulevard Jean-Moulin, 13385 Marseille, France.

Recently, a large number of novel agents have been developed thanks to a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Among these, the potent inhibitor of the isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutant protein, enasidenib (formerly AG-221), has demonstrated promising antileukemic activity by targeting IDH2 mutations. Area covered: This review describes the mechanisms of action, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, the safety, and efficacy of enasidenib. Phase I/II/III clinical trials are also reported and discussed. Expert opinion: Enasidenib is a novel agent able to differentiate leukemic blasts in functional, maturating cells. This drug is characterized by oral bioavailability and good tolerability. As a monotherapy, it demonstrates clinical and laboratorial improvement, in 19.6% and 38.8% of cases respectively. Differentiation syndrome is the most relevant, potentially life-threatening side effect, which physicians must be aware of. The authors believe that the way forwards now is to explore the role of enasidenib as a chemoresistance revertant when associated with chemotherapy, as a 'bridge to transplant' or when associated other novel agents if we wish to maximize its use.","['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Paterno, Giovangiacinto', 'Palmieri, Raffaele', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Del Principe MI', 'Paterno G', 'Palmieri R', 'Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Venditti A']",,"['Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata , Roma , Italia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190827,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'differentiation syndrome', 'enasidenib', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation', 'novel target therapy']",2019/08/28 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2019.1654456 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2019 Nov;20(16):1935-1942. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2019.1654456.

FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations are associated with an increased risk of relapse, and a number of small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 have been developed. The highly potent and selective FLT3 kinase inhibitor gilteritinib is the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. Areas covered: We review the biology and prognostic significance of FLT3 mutations in AML and discuss the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and toxicity profile of gilteritinib. We also summarize important differences among the various FLT3 inhibitors that are currently approved or under development and highlight areas of ongoing research. Expert opinion: Gilteritinib has been shown to improve survival compared to salvage chemotherapy in relapsed and/or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. Gilteritinib is orally available with a favorable toxicity profile and as such is quickly becoming the standard of care for this patient population. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating gilteritinib in combination with frontline chemotherapy, in combination with other agents such as venetoclax and azacitidine for patients who are ineligible for standard induction therapy, and as a maintenance agent.","['McMahon, Christine M', 'Perl, Alexander E']","['McMahon CM', 'Perl AE']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9745-9595', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1463-2231']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190827,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'Gilteritinib', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/28 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2019.1657009 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Sep;12(9):841-849. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2019.1657009.

METHODS: To provide a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of 45 published studies including 329,035 cases and 730,940 controls. We conducted a search in PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science to select studies on the association between rs10069690 and cancer risk. Stratification by ethnicity, cancer type, cancers' classification, source of control, sample size, and genotype method was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random effects models. Sensitivity, publication bias, false-positive report probability (FPRP) and statistical power were also assessed. RESULTS: The result demonstrated that rs10069690 was significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer overall (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12, p < .001) under the allele model. Stratification analysis revealed an increased cancer risk in subgroups of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, a significantly decreased association was observed in pancreatic cancer in the European population (OR = 0.93,95% CI: 0.87-0.99, p = .031). In the subgroup analysis based on cancer type, no significant association was found in prostate cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer and glioma. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that the TERT rs10069690 polymorphism may be a risk factor for cancer, especially breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and RCC. Further functional studies are warranted to reveal the role of the polymorphism in carcinogenesis.","['He, Guisheng', 'Song, Tao', 'Zhang, Yazhen', 'Chen, Xiuxiu', 'Xiong, Wei', 'Chen, Huamin', 'Sun, Chuanwei', 'Zhao, Chaoyang', 'Chen, Yunjing', 'Wu, Huangfu']","['He G', 'Song T', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen X', 'Xiong W', 'Chen H', 'Sun C', 'Zhao C', 'Chen Y', 'Wu H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9097-6001'],"['Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190827,United States,Mol Genet Genomic Med,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,PMC6785442,['NOTNLM'],"['* TERT', '*cancer', '*meta-analysis', '*polymorphism']",2019/08/28 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mgg3.903 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomic Med. 2019 Oct;7(10):e00903. doi: 10.1002/mgg3.903.

If stress resolution fails, the UPR commits the cell to apoptotic death. Here we show that in hematopoietic cells, including multiple myeloma (MM), lymphoma, and leukemia cell lines, ER stress leads to caspase-mediated cleavage of the key UPR sensor IRE1 within its cytoplasmic linker region, generating a stable IRE1 fragment comprising the ER-lumenal domain and transmembrane segment (LDTM). This cleavage uncouples the stress-sensing and signaling domains of IRE1, attenuating its activation upon ER perturbation. Surprisingly, LDTM exerts negative feedback over apoptotic signaling by inhibiting recruitment of the key proapoptotic protein BAX to mitochondria. Furthermore, ectopic LDTM expression enhances xenograft growth of MM tumors in mice. These results uncover an unexpected mechanism of cross-regulation between the apoptotic caspase machinery and the UPR, which has biologically significant consequences for cell survival under ER stress.","['Shemorry, Anna', 'Harnoss, Jonathan M', 'Guttman, Ofer', 'Marsters, Scot A', 'Komuves, Laszlo G', 'Lawrence, David A', 'Ashkenazi, Avi']","['Shemorry A', 'Harnoss JM', 'Guttman O', 'Marsters SA', 'Komuves LG', 'Lawrence DA', 'Ashkenazi A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5797-3116', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0885-1347', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6890-4589']","['Cancer Immunology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Cancer Immunology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Cancer Immunology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Cancer Immunology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Cancer Immunology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Cancer Immunology, Genentech, South San Francisco, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190827,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,PMC6711704,['NOTNLM'],"['*BAX', '*XBP1', '*apoptosis', '*cancer', '*cancer biology', '*cell biology', '*hematopoietic', '*human', '*mouse', '*myeloma']",2019/08/28 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.47084 [doi]', '47084 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Aug 27;8. pii: 47084. doi: 10.7554/eLife.47084.,20200203,,"['(c) 2019, Shemorry et al.']","['EC 2.7.11.1 (ERN1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Endoribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis']","['AS Anna Shemorry is affiliated with Genentech Inc.

Diagnosis of this disease depends on the demonstration of clonal lymphocytosis > 5 x 109/L with a characteristic immunophenotypic pattern amidst other clinical and laboratory features. Objectives: To determine the predominant clinical and laboratory features of CLL at presentation and their relationship with patient survival. This study also aims at examining the relationship between treatment protocol and outcome. Methods: This is a retrospective study with 8 years data (2010-2018) collected from four different centers. Data was analyzed using SPSS 20.0. Results: There were a total of 97 cases, with a male: female ratio of 1.1:1. The median age at presentation was 59 years. Approximately 55% of the patients presented at Binet stage C, with splenomegaly in 93.2% and 78% were anaemic. The mean white cell count was 137.9 +/- 14.7 x 109/L, with a median absolute lymphocyte count of 86 x 109/L. The commonest treatment regimen was chlorambucil and prednisolone and males had a superior response. The number of chemotherapy cycles, serum alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase correlated positively with duration of survival. Mortality rate over the five year period was 14.3%. Conclusion: CLL was found to present in younger patients when compared to previous studies with a median age of 57 years at diagnosis. Our study showed a slight female preponderance and better response to therapy in males. Majority of the patients presented in Binet stage C and were treated with chlorambucil-based drug combinations compared to more current treatment with Fludarabine-based combinations. A high serum alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase was found to positively correlate with survival amongst this patient population.","['Madu, Anazoeze Jude', 'Korubo, Kaladada', 'Okoye, Augustine', 'Ajuba, Ifeoma', 'Duru, Augustine N', 'Ugwu, Angela O', 'Nnachi, Oji', 'Okoye, Helen Chioma']","['Madu AJ', 'Korubo K', 'Okoye A', 'Ajuba I', 'Duru AN', 'Ugwu AO', 'Nnachi O', 'Okoye HC']",,"['Department of Haematology and Immunology, University of Nigeria Enugu Campus.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Port Harcourt.', 'Department of Haematology, Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki.', 'Department of Haematology Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Nnewi, Anambra State.', 'Department of Haematology and Immunology, University of Nigeria Enugu Campus.', 'Department of Haematology and Immunology, University of Nigeria Enugu Campus.', 'Department of Haematology, Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki.', 'Department of Haematology and Immunology, University of Nigeria Enugu Campus.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Malawi,Malawi Med J,Malawi medical journal : the journal of Medical Association of Malawi,9500170,PMC6698622,,,2019/08/28 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4314/mmj.v31i2.7 [doi]'],ppublish,Malawi Med J. 2019 Jun;31(2):144-149. doi: 10.4314/mmj.v31i2.7.,20200311,144-149,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To predict the clinical course of the disease, the identification of diagnostic biomarkers is urgently needed. Aberrant methylation patterns may predict CLL development and its course, being very early changes during carcinogenesis. Our aim was to identify CLL specific methylation patterns and to evaluate whether methylation aberrations in selected genes are associated with changes in gene expression. Here, by performing a genome-wide methylation analysis, we identified several CLL-specific methylation alterations. We focused on the most altered one, at a CpG island located in the body of SHANK1 gene, in our CLL cases compared to healthy controls. This methylation alteration was successfully validated in a larger cohort including 139 CLL and 20 control in silico samples. We also found a positive correlation between SHANK1 methylation level and absolute lymphocyte count, in particular CD19+ B cells, in CLL patients. Moreover, we were able to detect gains of methylation at SHANK1 in blood samples collected years prior to diagnosis. Overall, our results suggest methylation alteration at this SHANK1 CpG island as a biomarker for risk and diagnosis of CLL, and also in the personalized quantification of tumor aggressiveness.","['Loi, Eleonora', 'Moi, Loredana', 'Fadda, Antonio', 'Satta, Giannina', 'Zucca, Mariagrazia', 'Sanna, Sonia', 'Amini Nia, Shadi', 'Cabras, Giuseppina', 'Padoan, Marina', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Piro, Sara', 'Gentilini, Davide', 'Ennas, Maria Grazia', 'Southey, Melissa C', 'Giles, Graham G', 'Wong Doo, Nicole', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Zavattari, Patrizia']","['Loi E', 'Moi L', 'Fadda A', 'Satta G', 'Zucca M', 'Sanna S', 'Amini Nia S', 'Cabras G', 'Padoan M', 'Magnani C', 'Miligi L', 'Piro S', 'Gentilini D', 'Ennas MG', 'Southey MC', 'Giles GG', 'Wong Doo N', 'Cocco P', 'Zavattari P']",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, Occupational Health Unit, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cytomorphology Unit, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cytomorphology Unit, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, Occupational Health Unit, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, A.

However, the role and mechanism of miR-21 remain to be elucidated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present study, it was observed that miR-21 was upregulated and Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) was downregulated in AML cells compared with normal bone marrow cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that KLF5 was a direct target of miR-21. Indeed, miR-21 overexpression resulted in a downregulation of KLF5 expression, while miR-21 inhibition had the opposite effect in AML cells. In addition, miR-21 overexpression promoted the proliferation of AML cells in vitro. Notably, using a mouse xenograft model, miR-21 overexpression was demonstrated to result in enhanced tumor growth and suppressed KLF5 expression in the xenograft tumors in vivo. In conclusion, the present results indicated that miR-21 promoted proliferation through directly regulating KLF5 expression in AML cells. miR-21 may thus serve as an oncogene in AML, providing a potential target for AML therapy.","['Li, Chan', 'Yan, Hua', 'Yin, Jie', 'Ma, Jian', 'Liao, Ang', 'Yang, Shengyou', 'Wang, Lijuan', 'Huang, Yongxiang', 'Lin, Chon', 'Dong, Zhiqiang', 'Yang, Bo', 'Cao, Ting', 'Liu, Guo', 'Wang, Lv']","['Li C', 'Yan H', 'Yin J', 'Ma J', 'Liao A', 'Yang S', 'Wang L', 'Huang Y', 'Lin C', 'Dong Z', 'Yang B', 'Cao T', 'Liu G', 'Wang L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Changzhi Medical College Affiliated Heji Hospital, Changzhi, Shanxi 046000, P.R.

Cell proliferation in several hematological tumor cells lines following PHI treatment was evaluated in vitro using a Cell Counting Kit-8. The apoptosis and cell cycle of Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells (human M2 cell lines) following exposure to PHI were examined using flow cytometry. A colony-formation assay was used to identify the inhibitory effect of PHI on Kasumi-1 cells in vitro. Furthermore, Kasumi-1 xenograft tumor models were established. The antitumor effect of PHI was observed in vivo by measuring the size of the resulting xenograft tumors. The apoptosis of the xenograft tumor cells was measured using a TUNEL assay. Finally, protein expression levels were assessed by western blotting. PHI inhibited cell growth in 16 hematological tumor cell lines, with Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells being the most sensitive. In vitro treatment induced apoptosis and inhibited cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. PHI also inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in vivo. The compound increased the expression of caspases 3, 9 and 8, Fas and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Furthermore, PHI enhanced the protein expression of p53, Bax and p21 in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, PHI had a specific and notable inhibitory effect on Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 M2 cell lines in vivo and in vitro. Treatment inhibited cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial and Fas death receptor pathways. PHI restored the activity of mutated P53 and reactivated the P53 pathway, highlighting it as a potential target drug for mutated P53.","['Zou, Yong', 'Huang, Yiqun', 'Ma, Xudong']","['Zou Y', 'Huang Y', 'Ma X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, Fujian 363000, P.R.

Various Moon Hyung Yang (MHY) compounds have been developed as novel anti-cancer drug candidates; in the present study, the pro-apoptotic effects of (Z)-5-(3-ethoxy-4- hydroxybenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (MHY695) on HCT116 human colon cancer cells were assessed. MTT assays were performed to investigate the dose-dependent cytotoxic effects of MHY695 on HCT116 cells. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analyses were performed to identify apoptotic cell death, and western blot analysis was used to investigate the apoptotic-signaling pathways. A mouse xenograft model was also used to determine the effects of MHY695 in vivo. MHY695 decreased the viability of HCT116 cells and induced apoptotic cytotoxicity. The apoptotic mechanisms induced by MHY695 involved the dephosphorylation of Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death protein following protein kinase B inactivation, induced myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein and BH3-interacting domain death agonist truncation, caspase-3 and -9 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, MHY695 significantly suppressed tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model, compared with the vehicle control. Notably, MHY695 exhibited potent anti-cancer effects in four different types of human colon cancer cell line, including Caco-2, DLD-1, HT-29 and HCT116. Additionally, MHY695 showed reduced cytotoxicity in NCM460, normal colonic epithelial cells. Furthermore, MHY-induced cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells was independent of the tumor suppressor protein p53.

However, the mechanisms of matrine in AML remain largely unknown. The present study investigated the anticancer effects and underlying mechanisms of matrine on human AML cells in vitro. THP-1 cell lines were cultured and treated with different doses of matrine (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 g/l). The effects of matrine on the cell proliferation were assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The apoptotic effects were evaluated by DAPI and annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays. The effects of the drug on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/ mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) protein expression were studied by western blot analysis. The results of the present study demonstrated that matrine suppressed the viability of THP-1 cells. The anticancer effects were identified to be dose-dependent and the IC50 value was 1.2 g/l in THP-1 cells. Matrine inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis of AML cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, it was observed that matrine decreased the expression of phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the expression levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR remained almost unaltered. These findings indicated that matrine may inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of AML cells and may be a novel effective chemotherapeutic agent against AML.","['Hao, Yanmei', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Wei, Nannan', 'Yin, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Yingjie', 'Xu, Hui', 'Zhu, Chaomang', 'Li, Duojie']","['Hao Y', 'Zhang N', 'Wei N', 'Yin H', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu H', 'Zhu C', 'Li D']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, Anhui 233004, P.R.

The aim of the present study was to identify the hub genes involved in AML. In order to do so, the gene expression data of the GSE9476 database, including 26 AML and 10 normal samples, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then identified via bioinformatics analysis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed on DEGs. Furthermore, the most upregulated genes were selected for further investigation in the Oncomine, gene expression profiling interactive analysis and UALCAN datasets. In total, 1,744 upregulated and 1,956 downregulated genes were detected. The GO and KEGG results revealed that upregulated genes were enriched in metabolic processes, while downregulated genes were associated with the immune response. Serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 2 (SPINK2) ranked first among all the upregulated genes and was regarded as a hub gene in the development of AML. The overexpression of SPINK2 was validated in 12 patients with AML from the Linyi Central Hospital and in data from the Oncomine and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. Furthermore, the UALCAN and GEPIA datasets demonstrated that patients with high SPINK2 levels had shorter survival times. In conclusion, the results from the present study revealed that the SPINK2 gene was upregulated in patients with AML and that elevated SPINK2 expression was associated with poor outcomes in these patients.","['Xue, Cuiling', 'Zhang, Jialing', 'Zhang, Guiju', 'Xue, Yuyan', 'Zhang, Guiyan', 'Wu, Xia']","['Xue C', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang G', 'Xue Y', 'Zhang G', 'Wu X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Linyi Central Hospital, Linyi, Shandong 276400, P.R.

The expression levels of CCDC26 in the initially diagnosed and relapsed patients with AML were significantly upregulated compared with the control group. The upregulated expression level of CCDC26 in patients with AML was significantly associated with age, anemia, risk stratification and remission. Furthermore, patients with a high CCDC26 expression level had a poorer overall survival (P=0.0105). In addition, the area under the curve (AUC)1year and AUC2year of CCDC26 for overall survival were 0.722 and 0.686, respectively.

We performed CRISPR-Cas9 screens in a leukemia cell line to identify perturbations that enhance natural killer effector functions. Our screens defined critical components of the tumor-immune synapse and highlighted the importance of cancer cell interferon-gamma signaling in modulating NK activity. Surprisingly, disrupting the ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor DCAF15 strongly sensitized cancer cells to NK-mediated clearance. DCAF15 disruption induced an inflamed state in leukemic cells, including increased expression of lymphocyte costimulatory molecules. Proteomic and biochemical analysis revealed that cohesin complex members were endogenous client substrates of DCAF15. Genetic disruption of DCAF15 was phenocopied by treatment with indisulam, an anticancer drug that functions through DCAF15 engagement. In AML patients, reduced DCAF15 expression was associated with improved survival. These findings suggest that DCAF15 inhibition may have useful immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms.","['Pech, Matthew F', 'Fong, Linda E', 'Villalta, Jacqueline E', 'Chan, Leanne Jg', 'Kharbanda, Samir', ""O'Brien, Jonathon J"", 'McAllister, Fiona E', 'Firestone, Ari J', 'Jan, Calvin H', 'Settleman, Jeffrey']","['Pech MF', 'Fong LE', 'Villalta JE', 'Chan LJ', 'Kharbanda S', ""O'Brien JJ"", 'McAllister FE', 'Firestone AJ', 'Jan CH', 'Settleman J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1451-0234', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9660-4797', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9033-4028', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3569-6493']","['Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.', 'Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190827,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,PMC6713475,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR/CAS9 screening', '*DCAF15', '*PTPN2', '*cancer biology', '*human', '*natural killer cells']",2019/08/28 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.47362 [doi]', '47362 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Aug 27;8. pii: 47362. doi: 10.7554/eLife.47362.,20200203,,"['(c) 2019, Pech et al.']","['0 (DCAF15 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis']","['MP, LF, JV, LC, SK, JO, FM, AF, CJ employee of Calico Life Sciences, LLC, JS', 'Senior editor, eLife']",,['GEO/GSE134173'],,,,,,,,,

However, the details about clinical significances and biological functions of SNHG3 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain covered. In this study, we revealed increased SNHG3 expression in AML samples and cells and its high potential as a prognostic biomarker for AML patients. Likewise, serglycin (SRGN), which plays an important role in granule-mediated apoptosis, was previously verified to be upregulated in AML and confirmed again by the present study, and its upregulation predicted poor outcomes in AML. Furthermore, knockdown of SNHG3 or SRGN inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Besides, silencing SNHG3 noticeably decreased the expression of SRGN in AML cells. Moreover, we uncovered that SNHG3 modulated SRGN expression by competitively binding with miR-758-3p. Importantly, both miR-758-3p suppression and SRGN overexpression could mitigate the inhibitory effects of SNHG3 depletion on AML cell growth. Intriguingly, the higher SRGN expression in AML samples with a higher SNHG3 level exhibited an enhanced Ki67 level but a reduced caspase 3 level. To sum up, SNHG3 elicits a growth-promoting function in AML via sponging miR-758-3p to regulate SRGN expression, providing a new therapeutic road for AML patients.","['Peng, Linqiang', 'Zhang, Yanzhi', 'Xin, Hongli']","['Peng L', 'Zhang Y', 'Xin H']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4497-0810'],"[""Department of Pediatrics, Baoji People's Hospital Shaanxi Province, Baoji, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Lanling County People's Hospital, Lanling, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Lanling County People's Hospital, Lanling, Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190826,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*SNHG3', '*SRGN', '*cell growth', '*miR-758-3p']",2019/08/28 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29336 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Feb;121(2):1023-1031. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29336.

To determine antitumor activity triggered by simvastatin, four AML cell lines-U937, KG1, THP1 (NRAS(G12D) mutant) and HL60 (NRAS(Q61L) mutant)-were cultured with simvastatin and cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. For understanding mechanism of antitumor activity, immunoblot analysis for pAkt (Ser473), Akt, pMEK, MEK, pERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) was performed. Apoptotic cell population was calculated using the Annexin V-FITC assay, and cell cycle state was assessed by flow cytometry. Simvastatin showed different cytotoxic effect among AML cells, of which NRAS(G12D) mutant THP1 was the most statin sensitive cell line (IC50 values: 1.96 uM in HL60, 7.87 uM in KG1, 0.83 uM in THP1 and 1.37 uM in U937). Western blot analysis revealed that Ras downstream signaling molecules including Akt, MEK, and ERK1/2 were markedly inhibited in THP1 cells compared to other AML cells when exposed to simvastatin. In addition, only in THP1 cells, increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by simvastatin was observed. The combination of simvastatin and MEK inhibitor AZD6244 synergistically reduced THP1 cell proliferation compared to simvastatin alone and AZD6244 alone (IC50 values: 0.88 uM in simvastatin, 0.32 uM in AZD6244, and 0.23 uM in combination of simvastatin and AZD6244).

However, few prospective studies have been conducted. METHODS: A total of 65,042 individuals aged 40-79 years participated in this study and completed a self-administered questionnaire about their lifestyle and medical history at baseline (1988-1990). Of these, 52,462 individuals living in 24 communities with information on incident hematologic neoplasms available in the cancer registry, who did not have a history of cancer and provided valid information on frequency of green tea consumption, were followed through 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of hematologic neoplasms according to green tea consumption were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of hematologic neoplasms during a median follow-up of 13.3 years was 323. Compared with the never-drinkers of green tea, the multivariate HRs and 95% CIs for total hematologic neoplasms in green tea drinkers of </= 2 cups/day, 3-4 cups/day, and >/= 5 cups/day were 0.65 (0.42-1.00), 0.73 (0.47-1.13), and 0.63 (0.42-0.96), respectively. The association was more prominent for acute myeloid leukemias and follicular lymphomas.

Recent advances in the understanding of AML pathogenesis support therapeutic targeting of leukemia stem cells as the most promising avenue toward a cure. In this review, we provide an overview of the evolving leukemia stem cell (LSC) model, including evidence of the cell of origin, cellular and molecular disease architecture, and source of relapse in AML. In addition, we explore limitations of current targeted strategies utilized in AML and describe the various immunophenotypic antigens that have been proposed as LSC-directed therapeutic targets. We draw lessons from current approaches as well as from the (pre)-LSC model to suggest criteria that immunophenotypic targets should meet for more specific and effective elimination of disease-initiating clones, highlighting in detail a few targets that we suggest fit these criteria most completely.","['Mitchell, Kelly', 'Steidl, Ulrich']","['Mitchell K', 'Steidl U']",,"['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.', 'Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200102,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,101571139,PMC6938655,,,2019/08/28 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['cshperspect.a036251 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a036251 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2020 Jan 2;10(1). pii: cshperspect.a036251. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a036251.,20210519,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical proof of concept of blinatumomab efficacy was initially demonstrated in patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in the MT103-104 phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion trial (NCT00274742), which defined 60 microg/m(2) per day as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The clinically most relevant adverse effects were neurologic symptoms and cytokine release syndrome. Currently, there are no data on long-term outcomes and toxicity for B-NHL patients receiving blinatumomab treatment, so we performed a single-center, long-term follow-up analysis of 38 patients who participated in the MT103-104 phase 1 trial. We found no evidence for long-term toxicities, especially no blinatumomab-induced neurocognitive impairments. For the entire study population, the median overall survival (OS) was 4.6 years. Remarkably, patients who had received >/=60 microg/m(2) per day and responded to blinatumomab achieved a median OS of 7.7 years. Of note, 6 of the surviving patients treated at the MTD have been treatment-free for more than 7 years. In contrast, patients who were treated at dose levels below the MTD had a median OS of only 1.1 years. These results indicate that 60 microg/m(2) per day seems to represent the targeted dose level of blinatumomab required for durable remission in R/R B-NHL. Here, we provide the first clinical evidence that blinatumomab lacks long-term toxicity and has the potential to induce sustained remissions in patients with R/R B-NHL.","['Dufner, Vera', 'Sayehli, Cyrus M', 'Chatterjee, Manik', 'Hummel, Horst D', 'Gelbrich, Gotz', 'Bargou, Ralf C', 'Goebeler, Maria-Elisabeth']","['Dufner V', 'Sayehli CM', 'Chatterjee M', 'Hummel HD', 'Gelbrich G', 'Bargou RC', 'Goebeler ME']",,"['Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken and.', 'Institute of Clinical Epidemiology and Biometry, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6712531,,,2019/08/28 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000025 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000025 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Aug 27;3(16):2491-2498. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000025.,20200817,2491-2498,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Different environmental factors might be effective in the occurrence of this malignancy during childhood. The aim of this study was to find environmental risk factors in childhood ALL in Hamadan, Iran. Methods: This case-control study was done in 2015-2018 on 125 children younger than 15 years of age suffering from ALL. Patients were matched with 130 controls with respect to age, gender, and residence location. The identification of risk factors for ALL was sought based on the comparison of studied variables between case and control individuals. Results: A statistically significant increased risk for ALL was found with regard to type of delivery (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.20 - 0.92, p<0.02), childcare (OR: 4.58, 95% CI: 0.95 - 22.20, p<0.04), birth weight (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.53 - 2.21, p<0.006), father's education level (OR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.10 - 6.45, p<0.02), and father's job (OR: 0.2 95% CI: 0.08 - 0.51, p<0.001). Also observed were increased odds for ALL regarding male gender, mother's high education level, mother's freelance job, and medium or high family income. No association with ALL incidence was observed for age, gender, breastfeeding, mother's age at pregnancy, malignancy in first- or second-degree relatives, or mother's use of hair dye during pregnancy (p> 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that father's education level, father's job, delivery type, birth weight, and childcare can play a role in the incidence of childhood ALL.","['Rafieemehr, Hassan', 'Calhor, Fereshteh', 'Esfahani, Hossein', 'Ghorbani Gholiabad, Somayeh']","['Rafieemehr H', 'Calhor F', 'Esfahani H', 'Ghorbani Gholiabad S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3904-5671'],"['Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.

Purpose: We aim to investigate the expression of the MDR1 gene in 100 Egyptian AML patients, to identify their role on both the progression and chemotherapeutic refractoriness together with assessment of known prognostic molecular markers; FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations. Methodology: Quantitative assessment of MDR1 gene expression was performed by quantitative RT-PCR. Additional prognostic molecular markers were determined as internal tandem duplications of the FLT 3 gene and nucleophosmin gene mutation A. Results: MDR1 gene expression levels and FLT3/ITD mutations were significantly higher in AML patients with resistant disease with P value <0.001 and 0.002 respectively. However, NPM1 was insignificantly higher in patients with CR P-value 0.14. In MDR positive group, wild FLT3/ITD with or without NPM1 mutation was favorable in achieving CR with p value 0.02. MDR negative group, wild FLT3/ITD with or without NPM1 mutation showed insignificantly higher CR rates with p value (0.35). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed statistically significant difference between MDR1-negative and MDR1-positive patients regarding their DFS and OS between the two groups where DFS and OS were higher in MDR1-negative patients with p value 0.004 and 0.01, respectively. Conclusion: The results obtained by the current work together with the previous researches concerning the study of multidrug resistance genes in AML patients provide additional evidence of the role played by these genes as predictors of chemoresistance and poor treatment outcome.","['Kassem, Neemat M', 'Medhat, Nashwa', 'Kassem, Hebatallah A', 'El-Desouky, Mohamed A']","['Kassem NM', 'Medhat N', 'Kassem HA', 'El-Desouky MA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6033-6839'],"['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Kasr Al Ainy Centre of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

IDH2 gene encodes for isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme which is involved in the TCA cycle domino effect and converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate. In the U.S, the annual incidence of AML progressively increases with age to a peak of 12.6 per 100,000 adults of 65 years or older. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (arginine 132) have been demonstrated to be recurrent gene alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by forming 2-Hydroxy alpha ketoglutarate which, instead of participating in TCA cycle, accumulates to form AML. The current study approaches by molecular docking and virtual screening to elucidate inhibitor with superior affinity against IDH2 and achieve a pharmacological profile. To obtain the best established drug Molegro Virtual Docker algorithm was executed. The compound AG-221 (Pub CID 71299339) having the high affinity score was subjected to similarity search to retrieve the drugs with similar properties. The virtual screened compound SCHEMBL16391748 (PubChem CID-117816179) shows high affinity for the protein.

Each type has two more subtypes: Lymphoid and myeloid. Hence, in total, there are four subtypes of leukemia. This study proposes a new approach for diagnosis of all subtypes of leukemia from microscopic blood cell images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which requires a large training data set. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next, we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia. Besides, we also explored other well-known machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. To evaluate our approach, we set up a set of experiments and used 5-fold cross-validation. The results we obtained from experiments showed that our CNN model performance has 88.25% and 81.74% accuracy, in leukemia versus healthy and multiclass classification of all subtypes, respectively. Finally, we also showed that the CNN model has a better performance than other wellknown machine learning algorithms.","['Ahmed, Nizar', 'Yigit, Altug', 'Isik, Zerrin', 'Alpkocak, Adil']","['Ahmed N', 'Yigit A', 'Isik Z', 'Alpkocak A']",,"['Department of Computer Engineering, Dokuz Eylul University, 35160 Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Dokuz Eylul University, 35160 Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Dokuz Eylul University, 35160 Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Dokuz Eylul University, 35160 Izmir, Turkey. alpkocak@ceng.deu.edu.tr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190825,Switzerland,Diagnostics (Basel),"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",101658402,PMC6787617,['NOTNLM'],"['convolutional neural network', 'data augmentation', 'deep learning', 'leukemia diagnosis', 'microscopic blood cells images', 'multi-class classification', 'recognizing leukemia subtypes']",2019/08/28 06:00,2019/08/28 06:01,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['diagnostics9030104 [pii]', '10.3390/diagnostics9030104 [doi]']",epublish,Diagnostics (Basel). 2019 Aug 25;9(3). pii: diagnostics9030104. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics9030104.,,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Radiotherapy plays a significant role in cancer treatment; however, the use of such therapy is not without devastating side effects. The impact of radiation-induced damage to the brain is multifactorial, but the damage to neural stem cell populations seems to play a key role. The brain contains pools of regenerative neural stem cells that reside in specialized neurogenic niches and can generate new neurons. In this review, we describe the advances in radiotherapy techniques that protect neural stem cell compartments, and subsequently limit and prevent the occurrence and development of side effects. We also summarize the current knowledge about neural stem cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in neural stem cell niches after brain radiotherapy. Strategies used to minimize radiation-related damages, as well as new challenges in the treatment of brain tumors are also discussed.","['Michaelidesova, Anna', 'Konirova, Jana', 'Bartunek, Petr', 'Zikova, Martina']","['Michaelidesova A', 'Konirova J', 'Bartunek P', 'Zikova M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9478-869X'],"['Laboratory of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiation Dosimentry, Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i., Na Truhlarce 39/64, 180 00 Prague 8, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiation Dosimentry, Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i., Na Truhlarce 39/64, 180 00 Prague 8, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, v. v. i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic. mzikova@img.cas.cz.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190824,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC6770913,['NOTNLM'],"['*brain and nervous system cancers', '*neural stem cells', '*neurogenic niches', '*radiotherapy', '*sparing of neurogenic regions']",2019/08/28 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/08/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['genes10090640 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10090640 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Aug 24;10(9). pii: genes10090640. doi: 10.3390/genes10090640.,20200211,,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/cytology/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Neurogenesis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We present an 89-year-old man with epidermotropic B cell lymphoma, who presented with a pityriasis rosea-like skin rash. An initial diagnosis of diffuse large cell B cell lymphoma was made based on the extent of dermal-based large cell infiltration. However, after recognizing the epidermotropic component and the distinctive clinical presentation, a diagnosis of epidermotropic B cell lymphoma was rendered. There was minimal bone marrow involvement based only on flow cytometric analysis, but there was no apparent bone marrow or splenic involvement on routine light microscopic assessment. Remission was = achieved with single agent rituximab chemotherapy and the patient remained symptom free. The neoplastic CD20 positive epidermotropic B lymphocytes expressed CXCR3. Similar to the prior reported cases by the authors, the neoplastic cells expressed CXCR3, a chemokine whose organ and tissue specific ligands could contribute to its relatively indolent clinicalcourse.","['Magro, Cynthia M', 'Momtahen, Shabnam', 'Coleman, Morton', 'Grossman, Marc E']","['Magro CM', 'Momtahen S', 'Coleman M', 'Grossman ME']",,"['Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY. cym2003@med.cornell.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190715,United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,,,,2019/08/27 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2019 Jul 15;25(7).,20200210,,,"['0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CXCR3/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common PDGFRA partner is the FIP1L1 gene, generating the oncoprotein FIP1L1/PDGFRA (F/P). In the majority of cases the F/P fusion gene originates from intrachromosomal rearrangement at band 4q12, and occasionally from chromosomal translocations. In both cases, the interstitial chromosomal deletion of a region involving the CHIC2 gene has been reported, which is cryptic by conventional karyotyping but detectable by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analyses. Herein, we report an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) case presenting with eosinophilia; the F/P fusion gene originated from a new, cryptic and complex intrachromosomal rearrangement of 4q12. Classical FISH assay revealed abnormal hybridization signals, but the presence of the F/P chimaeric gene was demonstrated by molecular analysis. We performed molecular characterization of the chromosomal rearrangement and targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis with a myeloid gene panel, revealing the presence of pathogenic genomic variants affecting the TET2 and ETV6 genes. These mutations were present as subclones at the disease onset and their clone size increased at relapse.","['Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Orsini, Paola', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Tota, Giuseppina', 'Minervini, Crescenzio Francesco', 'Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Parciante, Elisa', 'Coserva, Maria Rosa', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Coccaro N', 'Anelli L', 'Orsini P', 'Zagaria A', 'Minervini A', 'Impera L', 'Tota G', 'Minervini CF', 'Cumbo C', 'Parciante E', 'Coserva MR', 'Attolico I', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']",,"['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, P.zza G.

Incorporation of CTLA4Ig in conditioning aided long-term remission in myeloma probably by blocking the CD28-CD86 pro-survival pathway when combined with CTLA4Ig-primed DLI. We explored a similar approach in 12 patients (8-65 years) who had refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma (R-ABCL) following autologous HCT. They received CTLA4Ig-based reduced-intensity conditioning and sequential CTLA4Ig-primed DLIs on days +7, +21, and +35. None developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Two patients developed chronic GVHD. Only 3 patients had disease-progression at 100 days posttransplant with a progression-free and GVHD-free survival at 2 years of 75%. A higher expression of CD80 in tumor cells and a greater proliferation of CD56dim CD16+ NK cells were observed at days +30 and +60 in patients with progression-free survival. We hypothesize that CTLA4Ig, with a greater avidity for CD80, probably interferes with the anti-apoptotic effect mediated through this pathway, and together with early proliferation of mature NK cell when used in conjunction with DLI, this approach might provide a curative option for patients with R-ABCL.","['Jaiswal, Sarita Rani', 'Aiyer, Hema Malini', 'Rawat, Garima', 'Gera, Arun', 'Chakrabarti, Suparno']","['Jaiswal SR', 'Aiyer HM', 'Rawat G', 'Gera A', 'Chakrabarti S']",,"['Cellular Therapy and Immunology, Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, India; Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.

Decreased cancer cell lines viability was reported upon CA treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of CA induced cytotoxicity using two human cell lines, Jurkat E6.1 (human cell T lymphoma) and HL-60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia). Significant increases of apoptotic cell death markers upon CA treatment were observed: annexin-V positiveness, potential mitochondrial disturbances, cell cycle changes, caspase activation, and CD95 expression. These effects were not detected in normal lymphocytes. CA induced the appearance of Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and cytochrome c release in Jurkat cells, and cleaved caspase 3 and phosphorylated p53 in HL60cells. Likewise, downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-x (Jurkat), Bcl-2, and XIAP (HL60) was observed with CA treatment. Both pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic were activated when cell lines were treated with CA. NF-kappaB p65 inhibition was observed in Jurkat cells and cell differentiation in HL-60cells. CA could be a potential leader compound for the development of new drugs for leukemia treatment in humans.","['Martinez, Gricelis Patricia', 'Mijares, Michael Rodney', 'Chavez, Katiuska', 'Suarez, Alirica Isabel', 'Compagnone, Reinaldo Santi', 'Chirinos, Perla', 'De Sanctis, Juan Bautista']","['Martinez GP', 'Mijares MR', 'Chavez K', 'Suarez AI', 'Compagnone RS', 'Chirinos P', 'De Sanctis JB']",,"['Instituto de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela.', 'Instituto de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela; Unidad de Biotecnologia, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela.', 'Unidad de Productos Naturales, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela.', 'Unidad de Productos Naturales, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela.', 'Escuela de Quimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela.', 'Instituto de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela.', 'Instituto de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Apartado 50109, Caracas, 1050-A, Venezuela; Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 1333/5, 779 00, Olomouc, Czech Republic.

METHODS: One hundred forty-seven patients were included. All patients underwent unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell RIC allo-HSCT. Median follow-up was 12.8 months (range 0.5-39). RESULTS: Median age was 58 years. Twenty-nine (20%) recipients received 10/10 MRD grafts, 69 (47%) 10/10 MUD grafts, 20 (13.6%) 9/10 MMUD, and 29 (20%) haploidentical grafts. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD at day +100, and moderate/severe chronic GVHD at 1-year were as follow: 14.3%, 1.4%, and 8.3%. There were no significant differences according to donor type (P = .46) and cumulative incidence of GVHD. One-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality, and GVHD-free/Relapse-free survival were as follows: 66.9% (95% CI 58.4-74), 59.9%, and 18.7% and 53.7%. KPS </= 80 was predictive of worst OS (P = .04). Those recipients who received MUD transplants had better RFS (P = .01).

Little is known concerning cardiotoxicity in the chronic phase after completion of treatment. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old woman with a past history of cardiac involvement of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) underwent electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation for symptomatic atrial tachycardia (AT). She was diagnosed with ALL when she was 8 years old and treated with systematic chemotherapy with prednisolone and vincristine. After complete remission, she suffered from repeated palpitations beginning at the age of 16 years. Electrophysiologic study using high-density (HD) mapping showed two types of peritricuspid AT in addition to low voltage in the right atrium with conduction delay. DISCUSSION: Cardiac involvement by malignant lymphocytic neoplasms is a rare phenomenon, and cardiac infiltration often disappears after remission of ALL. Thus, little is known about cardiac electrophysiological characteristics in the chronic phase of complete remission of ALL. We describe a rare case of a patient with multiple peritricuspidal reentry tachycardias after cardiac infiltration by leukaemia using a HD mapping system.","['Kawamura, Iwanari', 'Fukamizu, Seiji', 'Miyazawa, Satoshi', 'Hojo, Rintaro']","['Kawamura I', 'Fukamizu S', 'Miyazawa S', 'Hojo R']",,"['Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo Hospital, 2-34-10 Ebisu, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo Hospital, 2-34-10 Ebisu, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo Hospital, 2-34-10 Ebisu, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo Hospital, 2-34-10 Ebisu, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Eur Heart J Case Rep,European heart journal.

We present leukemia incidence and mortality radiation risk estimates derived from the National Registry for Radiation Workers, which is a large cohort of occupationally exposed workers from the United Kingdom (UK). The cohort comprised 173,081 workers from the UK who were monitored for occupational exposure to radiation. The cohort was followed for a total of 5.3 million person-years and the incidence and mortality due to leukemia was identified through to the end of follow-up in 2011. Poisson regression was used to investigate the relationship between cumulative radiation dose and leukemia mortality and incidence rates using excess relative risk (ERR) and excess additive risk (EAR) models. The results of this work showed a collective dose of 4,414 person-Sv accumulated by the cohort with an average cumulative dose of 25.5 mSv. Among male workers both the ERR and EAR models showed evidence of increased leukemia risk (excluding chronic lymphatic leukemia) associated with increasing cumulative dose. The ERR was 1.38 per Sv (90% CI: 0.04; 3.24) and EAR was 1.33 per 10,000 person-year-Sv (90% CI: 0.04; 2.89) when a linear model was used. These excess risks were driven by increased risks for chronic myeloid leukemia [ERR/Sv = 6.77 (90% CI: 2.14; 15.44)]. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that leukemia risks may be increased by low-dose and protracted external radiation exposure. The risks are generally consistent with those observed in the atomic bomb survivor studies, as well as with risk coefficients on which international radiation safety standards, including the dose limits and constraints used to control exposures, are based.","['Gillies, Michael', 'Haylock, Richard', 'Hunter, Nezhat', 'Zhang, Wei']","['Gillies M', 'Haylock R', 'Hunter N', 'Zhang W']",,"['Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (PHE-CRCE), Chilton, United Kingdom.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (PHE-CRCE), Chilton, United Kingdom.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (PHE-CRCE), Chilton, United Kingdom.', 'Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (PHE-CRCE), Chilton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190826,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,,,2019/08/27 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1667/RR15358.1 [pii]', '10.1667/RR15358.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2019 Nov;192(5):527-537. doi: 10.1667/RR15358.1.

For this reason, there are a number of TopoII-targeted anticancer drugs that act by inducing DNA cleavage mediated by both TopoII isoforms (TopoIIalpha and TopoIIbeta) in cells. However, recent studies suggest that specific poisoning of TopoIIalpha may be a safer strategy for treating cancer. This is because poisoning of TopoIIbeta appears to be linked to the generation of secondary leukemia in patients. We recently reported that enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage complexes (in which TopoII is covalently linked to the cleaved DNA during catalysis) formed in the presence of the anticancer drug etoposide persisted approximately 3-fold longer with TopoIIalpha than TopoIIbeta. Notably, enhanced drug-target residence time may reduce the adverse effects of specific TopoIIalpha poisons. However, it is still not clear how to design drugs that are specific for the alpha isoform. In this study, we report the results of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to comparatively analyze the molecular interactions formed within the TopoII/DNA/etoposide complex with both isoforms. We also used smoothed potential MD to estimate etoposide dissociation kinetics from the two isoform complexes. These extensive classical and enhanced sampling simulations revealed stabilizing interactions of etoposide with two serine residues (Ser763 and Ser800) in TopoIIalpha. These interactions are missing in TopoIIbeta, where both amino acids are alanine residues.

By mimicking physiological bone marrow microenvironment, the growth conditions were optimized by using frozen BMMCs derived from healthy donors. Healthy BMMCs are capable of differentiating into major hematopoietic lineages and various types of stromal cells in this platform. Cryopreserved BMMC samples from 49 AML patients were characterized for ex vivo growth and sensitivity to Ara-C. RNA sequencing was performed for 3D and 2D cultures to determine differential gene expression patterns. Specific genetic mutations and/or gene expression signatures associated with the ability of the ex vivo expansion and response to Ara-C were elucidated by whole-exome and RNA sequencing. Data analysis identified unique gene expression signatures and novel genetic mutations associated with sensitivity to Ara-C treatment of proliferating AML specimens and can be used as predictive therapeutic biomarkers to determine the optimal treatment regimens. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the translational value of this ex vivo platform which should be widely applicable to evaluate other therapies in AML.","['Xu, Haiyan', 'Muise, Eric S', 'Javaid, Sarah', 'Chen, Lan', 'Cristescu, Razvan', 'Mansueto, My Sam', 'Follmer, Nicole', 'Cho, Jennifer', 'Kerr, Kimberley', 'Altura, Rachel', 'Machacek, Michelle', 'Nicholson, Benjamin', 'Addona, George', 'Kariv, Ilona', 'Chen, Hongmin']","['Xu H', 'Muise ES', 'Javaid S', 'Chen L', 'Cristescu R', 'Mansueto MS', 'Follmer N', 'Cho J', 'Kerr K', 'Altura R', 'Machacek M', 'Nicholson B', 'Addona G', 'Kariv I', 'Chen H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6235-0546'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Strategic Planning & Research Informatics, Merck & Co., Inc., Beijing, China.', 'Department of Precision Oncology Biomarkers, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology Early Discovery, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology Early Development, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Discovery Chemistry, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology Early Discovery, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190826,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC6787505,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D culture', '*RNASeq', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*gene fusion', '*whole-exome sequencing']",2019/08/27 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14608 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2019 Oct;23(10):7063-7077. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14608.

Calix[4]arene derivatives and chlorambucil and ibuprofen are important compounds that exhibit interesting anticancer properties. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is the synthesis of new calix[4]arene-derivative conjugates of chlorambucil or ibuprofen with potential anticancer activity. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays were determined using the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) in microculture to measure cell growth as described [19, 20]. Conjugates of chlorambucil and resorcinarene-dendrimers were prepared in 2% DMSO and added into the culture medium immediately before use. Control cells were treated with 2% DMSO. RESULTS: Thus, calix[4]arene-derivative conjugates of chlorambucil or ibuprofen showed good stability of the chemical link between drug and spacer. Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the calix[4]arene chlorambucil or ibuprofen conjugates employing a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in K-562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells) and U-251 (human glioblastoma cells) demonstrated that the conjugate was more potent as an antiproliferative agent than free chlorambucil and ibuprofen. The conjugates did not show any activity against the COS-7 African green monkey kidney fibroblast cell line. CONCLUSION: In the paper, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic analyses of new calix[4]arene derivative conjugates of chlorambucil or ibuprofen. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that at 10 muM, the conjugates were very active against K-562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells) and U- 251 (human glioblastoma cells) cancer cells' proliferation. In order to explain the molecular mechanisms involved in the anticancer activity of calix[4]arene chlorambucil or ibuprofen conjugates, our research will be continued.","['Pedro-Hernandez, Luis D', 'Organista-Mateos, Ulises', 'Allende-Alarcon, Luis I', 'Martinez-Klimova, Elena', 'Ramirez-Apan, Teresa', 'Martinez-Garcia, Marcos']","['Pedro-Hernandez LD', 'Organista-Mateos U', 'Allende-Alarcon LI', 'Martinez-Klimova E', 'Ramirez-Apan T', 'Martinez-Garcia M']",,"['Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Circuito Exterior, Coyoacan, C.P. 04510, Mexico D.F., Mexico.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Circuito Exterior, Coyoacan, C.P. 04510, Mexico D.F., Mexico.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Circuito Exterior, Coyoacan, C.P. 04510, Mexico D.F., Mexico.', 'Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Circuito Interior, Coyoacan, C.P. 04510, Mexico D.F., Mexico.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Circuito Exterior, Coyoacan, C.P. 04510, Mexico D.F., Mexico.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Circuito Exterior, Coyoacan, C.P. 04510, Mexico D.F., Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chlorambucil', 'anticancer activity', 'calix[4]arene derivatives', 'calixarenes', 'human glioblastoma cells', 'ibuprofen']",2019/08/27 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-100458 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406415666190826162339 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2020;16(7):984-990. doi: 10.2174/1573406415666190826162339.,20210602,984-990,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (calix(4)arene)', '130036-26-9 (Calixarenes)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'WK2XYI10QM (Ibuprofen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calixarenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Ibuprofen/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PAQR3 is a newly discovered tumor suppressor that also regulates autophagy induced by nutrient starvation via AMPK and MTORC1 signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated whether PAQR3 modulates EGFR-mediated autophagy and whether such regulation is associated with the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3. PAQR3 is able to inhibit the in vitro and in vivo growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. PAQR3 potentiates autophagy induced by EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Knockdown of PAQR3 abrogates erlotinib-mediated reduction of BECN1 interaction with autophagy inhibitory proteins RUBCN/Rubicon and BCL2. PAQR3 blocks the interaction of BECN1 with the activated form of EGFR and inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of BECN1. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by knocking down ATG7 abrogates the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3 in NSCLC cells. Collectively, these data indicate that PAQR3 suppresses tumor progression of NSCLC cells through modulating EGFR-regulated autophagy.

This study evaluated the changes in HBV antibody status and HBV infections after chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: The data of patients with ALL diagnosed between April 2007 and March 2013 were retrospectively collected. Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titers were defined as negative at levels <10 IU/L. The HBsAb titers were individually compared before and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were included in this study. At the time of diagnosis, 32 (36.4%) and 56 (63.6%) patients were HBsAb negative and HBsAb positive, respectively. The 56 HBsAb-positive patients were categorized into two groups, namely, group A with 44 patients (78.6%, 44/56) who became HBsAb negative after chemotherapy, and group B with 12 patients (21.4%) who remained HBsAb positive. On multivariate analysis, lower initial levels of HBsAb titers were associated with HBsAb negativity after chemotherapy (relative risk: 1.003, 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.006; P = .009).

The most standardized methods to study MRD in ALL are multi-parametric flow cytometry (MFC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification-based methods. Emerging technologies hold the promise to improve MRD detection in ALL patients. Moreover, novel therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, bispecific T-cell engagers, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) represent exciting advancements in the management of B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL. Aims: Through a review of the literature and in house data, we analyze the current status of MRD assessment in ALL to better understand how some of its limitations could be overcome by emerging molecular technologies. Furthermore, we highlight the future role of MRD monitoring in the context of personalized protocols, taking into account the genetic complexity in ALL. Results and Conclusions: Molecular rearrangements (gene fusions and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor-IG/TR gene rearrangements) are widely used as targets to detect residual leukemic cells in ALL patients. The advent of novel techniques, namely next generation flow cytometry (NGF), digital-droplet-PCR (ddPCR), and next generation sequencing (NGS) appear important tools to evaluate MRD in ALL, since they have the potential to overcome the limitations of standard approaches. It is likely that in the forthcoming future these techniques will be incorporated in clinical trials, at least at decisional time points. Finally, the advent of new powerful compounds is further increasing MRD negativity rates, with benefits in long-term survival and a potential reduction of therapy-related toxicities. However, the prognostic relevance in the setting of novel immunotherapies still needs to be evaluated.","['Della Starza, Irene', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'De Propris, Maria S', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Cavalli, Marzia', 'De Novi, Lucia A', 'Soscia, Roberta', 'Messina, Monica', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Della Starza I', 'Chiaretti S', 'De Propris MS', 'Elia L', 'Cavalli M', 'De Novi LA', 'Soscia R', 'Messina M', 'Vitale A', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']",,"['Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190807,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6692455,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease (MRD)', 'next generation flow cytometry (NGF)', 'next generation sequencing (NGS)', 'novel agents', 'real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR)']",2019/08/27 06:00,2019/08/27 06:01,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00726 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Aug 7;9:726. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00726. eCollection 2019.,,726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquisition of heterogeneous genetic aberrations and epigenetic dysregulation lead to the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into leukemic stem cells (LSC), which subsequently gives rise to immature blast cells and a leukemic phenotype. LSCs are responsible for disease relapse as current chemotherapeutic regimens are not able to completely eradicate these cellular sub-populations. Therefore, it is critical to improve upon the existing knowledge of LSC specific markers, which would allow for specific targeting of these cells more effectively allowing for their sustained eradication from the cellular milieu. Although significant milestones in decoding the aberrant transcriptional network of various cancers, including leukemia, have been achieved, studies on the involvement of post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) in disease progression are beginning to unfold. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key players in mediating PTGR and they regulate the intracellular fate of individual transcripts, from their biogenesis to RNA metabolism, via interactions with RNA binding domains (RBDs). In this study, we have used an integrative approach to systematically profile RBP expression and identify key regulatory RBPs involved in normal myeloid development and AML. We have analyzed RNA-seq datasets (GSE74246) of HSCs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), monocytes, LSCs, and blasts. We observed that normal and leukemic cells can be distinguished on the basis of RBP expression, which is indicative of their ability to define cellular identity, similar to transcription factors. We identified that distinctly co-expressing modules of RBPs and their subclasses were enriched in hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSPCs) and differentiated monocytes. We detected expression of DZIP3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in HSPCs, knockdown of which promotes monocytic differentiation in cell line model. We identified co-expression modules of RBP genes in LSCs and among these, distinct modules of RBP genes with high and low expression. The expression of several AML-specific RBPs were also validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Network analysis identified densely connected hubs of ribosomal RBP genes (rRBPs) with low expression in LSCs, suggesting the dependency of LSCs on altered ribosome dynamics. In conclusion, our systematic analysis elucidates the RBP transcriptomic landscape in normal and malignant myelopoiesis, and highlights the functional consequences that may result from perturbation of RBP gene expression in these cellular landscapes.","['Saha, Subha', 'Murmu, Krushna Chandra', 'Biswas, Mayukh', 'Chakraborty, Sohini', 'Basu, Jhinuk', 'Madhulika, Swati', 'Kolapalli, Srinivasa Prasad', 'Chauhan, Santosh', 'Sengupta, Amitava', 'Prasad, Punit']","['Saha S', 'Murmu KC', 'Biswas M', 'Chakraborty S', 'Basu J', 'Madhulika S', 'Kolapalli SP', 'Chauhan S', 'Sengupta A', 'Prasad P']",,"['Epigenetic and Chromatin Biology Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Epigenetic and Chromatin Biology Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Translational Research Unit of Excellence (TRUE), Stem Cell and Leukemia Laboratory, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Epigenetic and Chromatin Biology Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Epigenetic and Chromatin Biology Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Cell Biology and Infectious Disease Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Cell Biology and Infectious Disease Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.', 'Translational Research Unit of Excellence (TRUE), Stem Cell and Leukemia Laboratory, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Kolkata, India.', 'Epigenetic and Chromatin Biology Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190806,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6691814,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA binding proteins (RBP)', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemic stem cells', 'myeloid development']",2019/08/27 06:00,2019/08/27 06:01,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00692 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Aug 6;9:692. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00692. eCollection 2019.,,692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor T cell addback can accelerate immune reconstitution but the therapeutic window between graft-vs.-host disease and protective immunity is very narrow in the haploidentical transplant setting. Hence, strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of adoptive T cell transfer are particularly relevant in this setting. Adoptive T cell transfer strategies in haploidentical transplantation include the use of antigen-specific T cells, allodepletion and alloanergy induction, immune modulation by the co-infusion of regulatory cell populations, and the use of safety switch gene-modified T cells. Whilst common principles apply, there are features that are unique to haploidentical transplantation, where HLA-mismatching directly impacts on immune reconstitution, and shared vs. non-shared HLA-allele can be an important consideration in antigen-specific T cell therapy. This review will also present an update on safety switch gene-modified T cells, which can be conditionally deleted in the event of severe graft- vs.-host disease or other adverse events. Herpes Virus Simplex Thymidine Kinase (HSVtk) and inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) are safety switches that have undergone multicenter studies in haploidentical transplantation with encouraging results. These gene-modified cells, which are trackable long-term, have also provided important insights on the fate of adoptively transferred T cells. In this review, we will discuss the biology of post-transplant T cell immune reconstitution and the impact of HLA-mismatching, and the different cellular therapy strategies that can help accelerate T cell immune reconstitution after haploidentical transplantation.","['Zhang, Ping', 'Tey, Siok-Keen']","['Zhang P', 'Tey SK']",,"['Clinical Translational Immunotherapy Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, QLD, Australia.', 'Clinical Translational Immunotherapy Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, QLD, Australia.', ""Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, QLD, Australia."", 'Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190806,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC6691120,['NOTNLM'],"['*T cell immune reconstitution', '*adoptive T cell therapy', '*antigen-specific T cells', '*gene modification', '*haploidentical transplant', '*safety switch']",2019/08/27 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01854 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Aug 6;10:1854. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01854. eCollection 2019.,20201021,1854,,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most APL patients acquire long-term survival after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic agents-based chemotherapy. Case presentation: A rare case of APL was reported after IRF2BP2-RARA was detected in the relapsed process using next-generation RNA-sequencing analysis. In addition, the mutation of NRAS was also detected. ATRA and arsenic trioxide combined with daunorubicin were used during induction treatment. The patient acquired complete remission but relapsed in 12 months. The patient was resistant to all other chemotherapies and refused any further therapy. The literature review indicated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might be a therapeutic method to treat APL with IRF2BP2-RARA fusion. Conclusion: Atypical APL should be considered even if the patients present with normal chromosomal karyotype and no classic PML-RARA fusions, but classical clinical features and bone marrow cell morphology. We reported a case of APL with IRF2BP2-RARA fusion was shown to harbor the NRAS mutation at relapse.","['Liu, Yiping', 'Xu, Fang', 'Hu, Hong', 'Wen, Jingjing', 'Su, Jing', 'Zhou, Qiaolin', 'Qu, Wen']","['Liu Y', 'Xu F', 'Hu H', 'Wen J', 'Su J', 'Zhou Q', 'Qu W']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1574-8866', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6731-1116', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6441-6211', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6994-9025', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2508-6771', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0022-0567', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8121-4531']","[""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190802,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6684484,['NOTNLM'],"['IRF2BP2-RARA', 'NRAS', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'gene fusion', 'mutation', 'variant translocation']",2019/08/27 06:00,2019/08/27 06:01,['2019/08/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S217622 [doi]', '217622 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Aug 2;12:6157-6163. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S217622. eCollection 2019.,,6157-6163,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) expressing LMO2 protein are functionally deficient in HR-mediated DSB repair. Mechanistically, LMO2 inhibits BRCA1 recruitment to DSBs by interacting with 53BP1 during repair. Similar to BRCA1-deficient cells, LMO2-positive DLBCLs and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells exhibit a high sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Furthermore, chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors synergize to inhibit the growth of LMO2-positive tumors. Together, our results reveal that LMO2 expression predicts HR deficiency and the potential therapeutic use of PARP inhibitors in DLBCL and T-ALL.","['Parvin, Salma', 'Ramirez-Labrada, Ariel', 'Aumann, Shlomzion', 'Lu, XiaoQing', 'Weich, Natalia', 'Santiago, Gabriel', 'Cortizas, Elena M', 'Sharabi, Eden', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Roberts, Evan', 'Bilbao-Cortes, Daniel', 'Vega, Francisco', 'Chapman, Jennifer R', 'Verdun, Ramiro E', 'Lossos, Izidore S']","['Parvin S', 'Ramirez-Labrada A', 'Aumann S', 'Lu X', 'Weich N', 'Santiago G', 'Cortizas EM', 'Sharabi E', 'Zhang Y', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Gentles AJ', 'Roberts E', 'Bilbao-Cortes D', 'Vega F', 'Chapman JR', 'Verdun RE', 'Lossos IS']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca and Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Departments of Medicine, and Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue/1475 NW 12th Avenue (D8-4), Miami, FL 33136, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA; Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Miami VA Healthcare System, Miami, FL, USA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the pooled long-term follow-up data from PCYC-1115 (RESONATE-2), PCYC-1112 (RESONATE), and CLL3001 (HELIOS), comprising a total of 1238 subjects, to determine the prognostic significance of these markers in patients treated with ibrutinib. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 47 months, ibrutinib-treated patients had longer progression-free survival (PFS) than patients treated in the comparator arm, regardless of genomic risk factors. Among patients treated with ibrutinib, we found that high-risk genomic features were not associated with shorter PFS (63-75% across all subgroups at 42 months) or overall survival (79-83% across all subgroups at 42 months). Surprisingly, we observed that ibrutinib-treated patients with del(11q) actually had a significantly longer PFS than ibrutinib-treated patients without del(11q) (42-month PFS rate 70% vs. 65%, P = .02). CONCLUSION: These analyses not only demonstrate that genomic risk factors previously associated with poor outcomes lose their adverse prognostic significance but also that del(11q) can be associated with a superior PFS with ibrutinib therapy.","['Kipps, Thomas J', 'Fraser, Graeme', 'Coutre, Steven E', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Byrd, John C', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Dilhuydy, Marie-Sarah', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Cramer, Paula', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Mahler, Michelle', 'Salman, Mariya', 'Eckert, Karl', 'Solman, Isabelle G', 'Balasubramanian, Sriram', 'Cheng, Mei', 'Londhe, Anil', 'Ninomoto, Joi', 'Howes, Angela', 'James, Danelle F', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Kipps TJ', 'Fraser G', 'Coutre SE', 'Brown JR', 'Barrientos JC', 'Barr PM', 'Byrd JC', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Hillmen P', 'Jaeger U', 'Moreno C', 'Cramer P', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Mahler M', 'Salman M', 'Eckert K', 'Solman IG', 'Balasubramanian S', 'Cheng M', 'Londhe A', 'Ninomoto J', 'Howes A', 'James DF', 'Hallek M']",,"['UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA.

CML is associated with the fusion of BCR (on chromosome 22) and ABL1 (on chromosome 9) resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The translocation of chromosomes (9;22)(q34;p15) is present in almost 90-95% of patients with CML and only 5-8% CML patients have established variant complex translocation due to the participation of one or more chromosomes other than 9 and 22 chromosome. In the present study, a unique case of a pH chromosome-positive CML is reported with a new variant pH translocation involving three chromosomal aberrations 6p22, 9q34, 22q11.2 and derivation 19 which has not been described previously. The complex variant translocation with pH chromosome was 46,XY,t(6;9;22)(p22:q34;q11.2), der(19)[48]/46,XY[2] in this newly diagnosed CML patient. Additional cytogenetic anomalies may be seen in patients which are not controlled by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor in CML patients or in accelerated/blastic phase. In this case, the patient' treatment was switched to dasatinib because the IS-NCN could not be controlled with imatinib. In conclusion, complex translocations in unusual locations of the BCR / ABL gene appear to indicate a poor prognosis.","['Ciftciler, Rafiye', 'Saglam, Emine Arzu', 'Inanc, Ayten', 'Ozcebe, Osman', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin']","['Ciftciler R', 'Saglam EA', 'Inanc A', 'Ozcebe O', 'Haznedaroglu IC']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Hacettepe Universty, 06100 Ankara, Turkey.

Single-cell cloning of modified cells is frequently used to facilitate studies of gene function. Inherent in this approach is an assumption that the genetic drift, amplified in some cell lines by mutations in DNA replication and repair machinery, as well as non-genetic factors will not introduce significant levels of experimental cellular heterogeneity in clones derived from parental populations. In this study, we characterize the variation in cell death of fifty clonal cell lines generated from human Jurkat and MOLT-4 T-cells edited by CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrate a wide distribution of sensitivity to chemotherapeutics between non-edited clonal human leukemia T-cell lines, and also following CRISPR-Cas9 editing at the NLRP1 locus, or following transfection with non-targeting sgRNA controls. The cell death sensitivity profile of clonal cell lines was consistent across experiments and failed to revert to the non-clonal parental phenotype. Whole genome sequencing of two clonal cell lines edited by CRISPR-Cas9 revealed unique and shared genetic variants, which had minimal read support in the non-clonal parental population and were not suspected CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects. These variants included genes related to cell death and drug metabolism. The variation in cell death phenotype of clonal populations of human T-cell lines may be a consequence of T-cell line genetic instability, and to a lesser extent clonal heterogeneity in the parental population or CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects not predicted by current models. This work highlights the importance of genetic variation between clonal T-cell lines in the design, conduct, and analysis of experiments to investigate gene function after single-cell cloning.","['Hanlon, Kathleen', 'Thompson, Alex', 'Pantano, Lorena', 'Hutchinson, John N', 'Al-Obeidi, Arshed', 'Wang, Shu', 'Bliss-Moreau, Meghan', 'Helble, Jennifer', 'Alexe, Gabriela', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Bauer, Daniel E', 'Croker, Ben A']","['Hanlon K', 'Thompson A', 'Pantano L', 'Hutchinson JN', 'Al-Obeidi A', 'Wang S', 'Bliss-Moreau M', 'Helble J', 'Alexe G', 'Stegmaier K', 'Bauer DE', 'Croker BA']",,"[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, United States; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.

Here we describe an informative AML-MRC case, showing two separate, but concurrent, chromothripsis events, occurred at the onset of the tumor, and originating an unbalanced t(5;7) translocation and a derivative chromosome 12 with a highly rearranged short arm. Conversely, despite chromothripsis has been often associated with genomic amplification in cancer, in this case a large marker chromosome harboring amplified sequences from chromosomes 19 and 22 arose from a stepwise mechanism. Notably, the patient also showed a TP53 mutated status, known to be associated with an increased susceptibility towards chromothripsis and a poor prognosis. Our results indicate that multiple chromothripsis events may occur early in neoplastic transformation and act in a synergistic way with progressive chromosomal alterations to determine a dramatic impact on disease outcome, as suggested by the gene expression profile analysis.","['Tolomeo, D', ""L'Abbate, A"", 'Lonoce, A', ""D'Addabbo, P"", 'Miccoli, M F', 'Lo Cunsolo, C', 'Iuzzolino, P', 'Palumbo, O', 'Carella, M', 'Racanelli, V', 'Mazza, T', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Martinelli, G', 'Macchia, G', 'Storlazzi, C T']","['Tolomeo D', ""L'Abbate A"", 'Lonoce A', ""D'Addabbo P"", 'Miccoli MF', 'Lo Cunsolo C', 'Iuzzolino P', 'Palumbo O', 'Carella M', 'Racanelli V', 'Mazza T', 'Ottaviani E', 'Martinelli G', 'Macchia G', 'Storlazzi CT']",,"['Department of Biology, University of Bari, Via Orabona 4, 70125 Bari, Italy.

The significance of longitudinal MRD monitoring curve and the missing MRD-specific elements for clinical decision-making were assessed. MRD-specific elements were significantly missing in clinical reports. The element ""testing results"" existed great inconsistencies in the written form of testing items and data. The longitudinal MRD monitoring curve of false-negative or false-positive MRD result was obviously different from all-correct. It not only identified MRD time point of tissue sampling relative to treatment and ensured the reliability of the negative MRD results, but also gave MRD diagnosis, clinical interpretation, and further recommendation.

Self-efficacy for symptom management (SESM) is a person's belief in their ability to perform behaviors to prevent and relieve symptoms. Presence of SESM can impact symptom distress and functional status. This study describes the changes over time and relationships among SESM, symptom distress, and physical functional status in adults during the acute phase of HSCT. METHODS: Patients (n=40) completed measures of symptom distress, SESM, and physical function at time points prior to and at days 7, 15 and 30 post-transplant. Clinical outcomes were length of stay and number of readmissions. RESULTS: Symptom distress, physical function, and SESM changed significantly over time. There was a significant negative relationship between symptom distress and physical function and between symptom distress and SESM at all points. The lowest levels of SESM and physical function were at day 7 when symptom distress was highest. Symptom distress was a moderator for the relationship between physical function and SESM at day 15. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to examine SESM in the acute phase of HSCT. Higher SESM was associated with fewer symptoms and increased physical function. Less symptom distress was associated with higher physical function and confidence to manage symptoms. These findings provide the basis for development of patient-centered interventions to enhance SESM when symptoms are at their highest immediately after HSCT.","['White, Lynn L', 'Kupzyk, Kevin A', 'Berger, Ann M', 'Cohen, Marlene Z', 'Bierman, Philip J']","['White LL', 'Kupzyk KA', 'Berger AM', 'Cohen MZ', 'Bierman PJ']",,"['College of Nursing, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 985330 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198, USA; Avera McKennan Hospital and University Health Center, 1325 S Cliff Ave, Sioux Falls, SD, 57105, USA; Augustana University, 2001 S Summit Ave, Sioux Falls, SD, 57197, USA.

Specific criteria were used for searching the published literature and for grading the quality and strength of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. A panel of ALL experts developed consensus on the treatment recommendations based on the evidence. Allogeneic HCT offers a survival benefit in selected patients with ALL, and this review summarizes the standard indications as well as the areas of controversy. There is now greater experience with pediatric-inspired chemotherapy regimens that has transformed upfront therapy for adult ALL, resulting in higher remission rates and overall survival. This in turn has increased the equipoise around decision making for ALL in first complete remission (CR1) when there is no measurable residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction and/or consolidation. Randomized studies are needed for adults with ALL to compare allogeneic HCT in CR1 with pediatric-inspired chemotherapy alone. Indications for transplantation in the evolving landscape of MRD assessments and novel targeted and immune therapeutics remain important areas of investigation.","['DeFilipp, Zachariah', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Cassaday, Ryan D', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Seftel, Matthew D', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Fanning, Suzanne', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Kansagra, Ankit', 'Johnston, Laura', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Sauter, Craig S', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Weisdorf, Daniel']","['DeFilipp Z', 'Advani AS', 'Bachanova V', 'Cassaday RD', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Kebriaei P', 'Rowe JM', 'Seftel MD', 'Stock W', 'Tallman MS', 'Fanning S', 'Inamoto Y', 'Kansagra A', 'Johnston L', 'Nagler A', 'Sauter CS', 'Savani BN', 'Perales MA', 'Carpenter PA', 'Larson RA', 'Weisdorf D']",,"['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.

The transcription factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in solid tumor and leukemia cells. We developed a screen to identify compounds that reduce the viability of liver cancer cells that express high levels of SALL4, and we investigated their mechanisms. METHODS: We developed a stringent high-throughput screening platform comprising unmodified SNU-387 and SNU-398 liver cancer cell lines and SNU-387 cell lines engineered to express low and high levels of SALL4. We screened 1597 pharmacologically active small molecules and 21,575 natural product extracts from plant, bacteria, and fungal sources for those that selectively reduce the viability of cells with high levels of SALL4 (SALL4(hi) cells). We compared gene expression patterns of SALL4(hi) cells vs SALL4-knockdown cells using RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Xenograft tumors were grown in NOD/SCID gamma mice from SALL4(hi) SNU-398 or HCC26.1 cells or from SALL4(lo) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells; mice were given injections of identified compounds or sorafenib, and the effects on tumor growth were measured. RESULTS: Our screening identified 1 small molecule (PI-103) and 4 natural compound analogues (oligomycin, efrapeptin, antimycin, and leucinostatin) that selectively reduced viability of SALL4(hi) cells. We performed validation studies, and 4 of these compounds were found to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase inhibitor oligomycin reduced the viability of SALL4(hi) hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines with minimal effects on SALL4(lo) cells. Oligomycin also reduced the growth of xenograft tumors grown from SALL4(hi) SNU-398 or HCC26.1 cells to a greater extent than sorafenib, but oligomycin had little effect on tumors grown from SALL4(lo) PDX cells. Oligomycin was not toxic to mice. Analyses of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data showed that SALL4 binds approximately 50% of mitochondrial genes, including many oxidative phosphorylation genes, to activate their transcription. In comparing SALL4(hi) and SALL4-knockdown cells, we found SALL4 to increase oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and use of oxidative phosphorylation-related metabolites to generate ATP. CONCLUSIONS: In a screening for compounds that reduce the viability of cells that express high levels of the transcription factor SALL4, we identified inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, which slowed the growth of xenograft tumors from SALL4(hi) cells in mice. SALL4 activates the transcription of genes that regulate oxidative phosphorylation to increase oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP generation in cancer cells. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation might be used for the treatment of liver tumors with high levels of SALL4.","['Tan, Justin L', 'Li, Feng', 'Yeo, Joanna Z', 'Yong, Kol Jia', 'Bassal, Mahmoud A', 'Ng, Guo Hao', 'Lee, May Yin', 'Leong, Chung Yan', 'Tan, Hong Kee', 'Wu, Chan-Shuo', 'Liu, Bee Hui', 'Chan, Tim H', 'Tan, Zi Hui', 'Chan, Yun Shen', 'Wang, Siyu', 'Lim, Zhi Han', 'Toh, Tan Boon', 'Hooi, Lissa', 'Low, Kia Ngee', 'Ma, Siming', 'Kong, Nikki R', 'Stein, Alicia J', 'Wu, Yue', 'Thangavelu, Matan T', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Periyasamy, Giridharan', 'Asara, John M', 'Dan, Yock Young', 'Bonney, Glenn K', 'Chow, Edward K', 'Lu, Guo-Dong', 'Ng, Huck Hui', 'Kanagasundaram, Yoganathan', 'Ng, Siew Bee', 'Tam, Wai Leong', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Chai, Li']","['Tan JL', 'Li F', 'Yeo JZ', 'Yong KJ', 'Bassal MA', 'Ng GH', 'Lee MY', 'Leong CY', 'Tan HK', 'Wu CS', 'Liu BH', 'Chan TH', 'Tan ZH', 'Chan YS', 'Wang S', 'Lim ZH', 'Toh TB', 'Hooi L', 'Low KN', 'Ma S', 'Kong NR', 'Stein AJ', 'Wu Y', 'Thangavelu MT', 'Suzuki A', 'Periyasamy G', 'Asara JM', 'Dan YY', 'Bonney GK', 'Chow EK', 'Lu GD', 'Ng HH', 'Kanagasundaram Y', 'Ng SB', 'Tam WL', 'Tenen DG', 'Chai L']",,"['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore;

However, currently, the treatment-free remission concept is becoming an important goal in clinical practice, and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors discontinuation studies have shown that round 50% of patients with a durable deep molecular response beyond major molecular response successfully interrupt tyrosine kinase inhibitors for at least three years without loss of molecular response. However, and regardless of the existing evidence, the exact conditions for attempting treatment-free remission remain poorly defined. Different authors tried to guide the clinical decision regarding this topic but there are some points that differ, namely with respect to the recommended duration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy and the appropriate molecular response prior to treatment-free remission. The goal of this article is to propose an algorithm to guide clinical practice in Portugal concerning chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia patients who wish to attempt treatment-free remission, since there are no national guidelines.","['Almeida, Antonio', 'Pierdomenico, Francesca', 'Guerrero, Blanca Polo', 'Saraiva, Filipa', 'Montalvao, Ana', 'Coutinho, Jorge', 'Mariz, Mario', 'Melo, Teresa', 'Santos, Maria Joao', 'Pereira, Alexandra', 'Cerveira, Nuno']","['Almeida A', 'Pierdomenico F', 'Guerrero BP', 'Saraiva F', 'Montalvao A', 'Coutinho J', 'Mariz M', 'Melo T', 'Santos MJ', 'Pereira A', 'Cerveira N']",,"['Department of Hematology.

We retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of low-dose melphalan (LD-Mel) in a multicenter analysis in patients over 65 years with R/R AML, who previously had received >/=1 non-curative treatment line. The study included 31 patients (median age 77 years) with 1-4 previous treatment lines. Three patients (9.7%) achieved a complete remission. Two patients (6.5%) achieved a partial remission, nine patients (29.0%) had disease stabilization with reduction of peripheral or bone marrow blast burden, resulting in an overall response rate of 16.1% and 45.2% achieved clinical benefit. Responders showed a significantly longer median overall survival than non-responders (16.3 vs. 2.3 months, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified complex karyotype as the only risk factor associated with inferior survival (p<0.001), whereas prior treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in 25 of 31 patients was associated with superior OS, regardless of prior response to HMAs (p=0.03). LD-Mel was well tolerated, with mild myelosuppressive side effects.

Hence, the aim of this study was to determine whether some strains had transmission advantages. First, we determined the whole BLV genome sequences of all 34 BLV-infected cows from one farm. Phylogenetic analysis divided strains into 26 major and 8 minor strains. The major strains dominantly spread independent of host factor, bovine leucocyte antigen. Further analysis, with molecular clones, associated transmissibility with viral productivity in vitro. In addition, the two groups could be classified by group-specific mutations. The reverse genetic approach demonstrated that a spontaneous mutation at nucleotide 175 of the BLV genome, which is located in the viral promoter region, could alter viral productivity by changing viral transactivation, suggesting that BLV transmissibility is affected by a spontaneous mutation associated with viral productivity.","['Murakami, Hironobu', 'Todaka, Haruna', 'Uchiyama, Jumpei', 'Sato, Reiichiro', 'Sogawa, Kazuyuki', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Tsukamoto, Kenji']","['Murakami H', 'Todaka H', 'Uchiyama J', 'Sato R', 'Sogawa K', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Tsukamoto K']",,"['Laboratory of Animal Health , School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, 252-5201, Japan.

In this study, we investigated the effect of edaravone on the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an enzyme responsible for the production of an array of neutrophil-derived oxidants that can cause cellular damage. The addition of edaravone to the reaction of MPO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly enhanced the reduction of MPO Compound II back to native MPO. Interestingly, the MPO-mediated production of toxic hypochlorous acid exhibited a concentration-dependent biphasic effect, with the apparent optimal edaravone concentration at 10muM. Oxidation of edaravone by MPO was examined by various analytical methods. An MPO-catalyzed product(s) of edaravone was identified at 350nm by kinetic analysis of UV-Vis spectroscopy. Several MPO-catalyzed metabolites of edaravone were proposed from the LC-MS analyses, including oxidized dimers from edaravone radicals. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping detected a carbon-centred radical metabolite of edaravone. NMR studies revealed that there are two exchangeable hydrogens, one of which is on the alpha-carbon, justifying the carbon-centred edaravone radical produced from MPO. Despite the formation of an edaravone carbon-radical metabolite, it did not appear to effectively oxidize GSH (in comparison with phenoxyl radicals). Viability (ATP) and cytotoxicity (LDH release) assays showed a concentration-dependent effect of edaravone on HL-60cells treated with either a bolus concentration of 30muMH2O2 or a flux of H2O2 generated by 5mM glucose and 10 mU/mL glucose oxidase. The H2O2-induced toxicity was ameliorated at high edaravone concentrations (100-200muM). In contrast, low concentrations of edaravone (1-10muM) exacerbated the H2O2-induced toxicity. However, the effect of edaravone at low concentration (0-10muM) appeared more prominent with the LDH assay only. The cellular findings correlated with the biochemical studies with respect to hypochlorous acid formation. These findings provide interesting perspectives regarding the duality of edaravone as an antioxidant drug.","['Suh, Lindsey Y K', 'Babu, Dinesh', 'Tonoyan, Lusine', 'Reiz, Bela', 'Whittal, Randy', 'Tabatabaei-Dakhili, S Amirhossein', 'Morgan, Andrew G', 'Velazquez-Martinez, Carlos A', 'Siraki, Arno G']","['Suh LYK', 'Babu D', 'Tonoyan L', 'Reiz B', 'Whittal R', 'Tabatabaei-Dakhili SA', 'Morgan AG', 'Velazquez-Martinez CA', 'Siraki AG']",,"['Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Katz Group-Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Katz Group-Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Katz Group-Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, 11227 Saskatchewan Drive, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2G2, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, 11227 Saskatchewan Drive, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2G2, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Katz Group-Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Katz Group-Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Katz Group-Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1, Canada.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the CH2Cl2 extract and chemical investigation of the cytotoxic fractions led to the isolation of a new sesquiterpenoid pseudo-dimer named vernodalidimer L, together with eight known sesquiterpenoids from the aerial part of V. extensa. The structures of the isolates were elucidated based on spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS. Vernolide has potent broad-spectrum cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the range of 0.91-13.84muM, against all ten cancer cell lines. The annexin-V flow cytometric analysis showed that vernodalin, vernolepin, and vernolide induced apoptosis on HepG2 cells in a dose dependent manner and these effects correlated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Our results indicated that vernodalin, vernolepin, and vernolide have potential to be used as lead compounds in the development of a therapeutic natural product for treatment of liver cancer.","['Thongnest, Sanit', 'Chawengrum, Pornsuda', 'Keeratichamroen, Siriporn', 'Lirdprapamongkol, Kriengsak', 'Eurtivong, Chatchakorn', 'Boonsombat, Jutatip', 'Kittakoop, Prasat', 'Svasti, Jisnuson', 'Ruchirawat, Somsak']","['Thongnest S', 'Chawengrum P', 'Keeratichamroen S', 'Lirdprapamongkol K', 'Eurtivong C', 'Boonsombat J', 'Kittakoop P', 'Svasti J', 'Ruchirawat S']",,"['Laboratory of Natural Products, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.

The standard diagnostic method, gene expression profiling, is not widely available. Efforts are ongoing to establish easy and clinically applicable diagnostic pathways to facilitate the accurate identification of these patients and thus enable a better understanding of the prognosis and outcomes with different treatment approaches. The rates of complete remission in ALL patients are consistently above 90% with the different induction protocols; however, maintaining remission depends on the risk group of the patient and consolidation therapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) is particularly beneficial when the risk of relapse is very high and the expected complications with transplant are low. Data on the outcomes of allo-HCT for Ph-like ALL are scarce. In this article we review the published literature on outcomes of Ph-like ALL patients treated using different therapeutic approaches and make recommendations about transplant consideration for these patients.","['El Fakih, Riad', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud']","['El Fakih R', 'Savani B', 'Mohty M', 'Aljurf M']",,"['King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-Oncology Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The structural distortion of DNA caused by polyamides has enhanced our understanding of the regulation of DNA-binding proteins via polyamides. Polyamides have DNA binding affinities that are comparable to those proteins, therefore, can potentially be used as therapeutic agents to treat diseases caused by aberrant gene expression. In fact, many diseases are characterized by over- or under-expressed genes. PU.1 is a transcription factor that regulates many immune system genes. Aberrant expression of PU.1 has been associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have, therefore, designed and synthesized ten hairpin polyamides to investigate their capacity in controlling the PU.1-DNA interaction. Our results showed that nine of the polyamides disrupt PU.1-DNA binding and the inhibition capacity strongly correlates with binding affinity. One molecule, FH1024, was observed forming a FH1024-PU.1-DNA ternary complex instead of inhibiting PU.1-DNA binding. This is the first report of a small molecule that is potentially a weak agonist that recruits PU.1 to DNA. This finding sheds light on the design of polyamides that exhibit novel regulatory mechanisms on protein-DNA binding.","['Liu, Beibei', 'Bashkin, James K', 'Poon, Gregory M K', 'Wang, Shuo', 'Wang, Siming', 'Wilson, W David']","['Liu B', 'Bashkin JK', 'Poon GMK', 'Wang S', 'Wang S', 'Wilson WD']",,"['Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Center for Nanoscience, University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63121, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA.

However, little is known about the role of hsa_circ_0007534 in cervical cancer specifically. In the current study, we aimed to explore the expression and function of hsa_circ_0007534 in cervical cancer. MAIN METHODS: The expression of circRNA, miRNA and mRNA was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Protein expression was assessed by Western blot. Knockdown of has_circ_0007534 was achieved by siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Cell proliferation was determined using a cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays. Cell invasion was assessed using a Transwell invasion assay. RNA interactions were measured using an RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays. KEY FINDINGS: The expression of hsa_circ_0007534 was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Depletion of hsa_circ_0007534 decreased both the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells. MicroRNA-498 (miR-498) was identified as a target of the miRNA encoded by hsa_circ_0007534. Levels of miR-498 were decreased in cervical cancer tissues, a finding that was inversely correlated with hsa_circ_0007534 expression. miR-498 overexpression repressed the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) was verified as a target gene of miR-498. BMI-1 overexpression reversed the effects of hsa_circ_0007534 depletion or miR-498 overexpression on cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates that downregulation of hsa_circ_0007534 represses the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer through regulating the miR-498/BMI-1 axis, suggesting the hsa_circ_0007534/miR-498/BMI-1 axis as a potential therapeutic target to treat cervical cancer.","['Rong, Xuan', 'Gao, Wei', 'Yang, Xiaomei', 'Guo, Junjun']","['Rong X', 'Gao W', 'Yang X', 'Guo J']",,"[""Gynecology Department, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an 710068, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shaanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital, Xi'an 710061, China."", ""Gynecology Department, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an 710068, China."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, Shaanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital, Xi'an 710061, China.

Advances in the quality of care in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have enabled to improve clinical outcomes. However, ME epidemiology in pediatric oncology is still incipient in developing countries. In view of this, the objectives of this study were to estimate the incidence of MEs, determine their types and consequences, as well as their preventability in the induction treatment of children with ALL at Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez. METHODS: We reviewed the remission-induction chemotherapy records of children with ALL between January 2015 and December 2017. A two-phase review was carried out for ME identification and verification. The consequences of errors were determined by agreement between reviewers. RESULTS: We reviewed 1762 chemotherapy orders involving 181 children. MEs were observed in 16.9% of orders and in 57.5% of patients. Prescription errors were the most common (93.3%), with wrong dose errors (90.2%) being predominant. Only 3.7% of wrong dose errors were intercepted, while 12.2% of the children experienced adverse drug events (ADEs) preceded by some wrong dose error. CONCLUSIONS: MEs were common, since they occurred in 57.5% of children with ALL on induction treatment and involved 16.5% of chemotherapy orders. Only 3.7% of MEs were intercepted, while 12.2% of children had ADEs related to overdose. Measures are required to prevent calculation error in prescriptions, as well as training of the nursing staff to intercept MEs.","['Vazquez-Cornejo, Edmundo', 'Morales-Rios, Olga', 'Juarez-Villegas, Luis E', 'Islas Ortega, Erika J', 'Vazquez-Estupinan, Felipe', 'Garduno-Espinosa, Juan']","['Vazquez-Cornejo E', 'Morales-Rios O', 'Juarez-Villegas LE', 'Islas Ortega EJ', 'Vazquez-Estupinan F', 'Garduno-Espinosa J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8118-4734'],"['Post-degree in Medical, Dentistry and Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Evidence-based Medicine Unit, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Department of Oncology, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Services, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Hospital Angeles Clinica Londres, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Directorate of Research, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']",['eng'],['852984/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190824,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6792484,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adverse drug events', '*developing countries', '*medication errors', '*patient safety', '*quality of care']",2019/08/25 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2019/08/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2438 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Oct;8(13):5979-5987. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2438.

Retinoid X receptor (RXR) occupies a central place in nuclear receptor signaling, and a pharmacological RXR-dependent pathway is involved in myeloid cell function. Here, structural information for 82 triterpenes from P. cocos and 17 known RXR agonists was collected in a compound library and retrieved for a molecular docking study. Three triterpenes, 16alpha-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA), pachymic acid (PA), and polyporenic acid C (PPAC), were identified as novel RXR-specific agonists based on luciferase reporter assays and in silico evidence. Treatment with HTA, PA, and PPAC significantly induced differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 with EC50 values of 21.0 +/- 0.52, 6.7 +/- 0.37, and 9.4 +/- 0.65 muM, respectively. These effects were partly blocked by the RXR antagonist UVI3003, suggesting that an RXR-dependent pathway may play an important role in their anti-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) effects. Taken together, triterpenes from P. cocos are revealed as naturally occurring RXR selective agonists with the potential for anti-cancer activity.

A systematic review to evaluate its importance in clinical practice.,10.1007/s00520-019-05047-x [doi],"Impaired cardiovascular and autonomic function during treatment and during recovery from leukemia has been indicated. In this context, heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive measure that describes the oscillations of the intervals between consecutive heart beats (RR intervals), influenced by the autonomic nervous system. We intend to review literature showing HRV changes in leukemia subjects. The articles selected in the current review were attained up to March 2018, and the search was limited to articles in English language, published in peer-reviewed journals, with both adult and child age samples. The articles were investigated in the five electronic databases: PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Cochrane Clinical Trials, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE). Towards the end of the research, 9 studies were included. Subjects undergoing treatment for leukemia have reduced HRV, signifying decreased vagal control of heart rate. The subjects that undertook leukemia treatment and their survivors experienced a reduction in HRV with subsequent recovery, but the recovery time is ill defined.

How exactly abnormal karyotypes arise and are propagated in AML is unclear. TP53 mutations and deletions are frequent in complex karyotype AML, suggesting a role of TP53 alterations in the development of chromosome abnormalities. Here, we generated isogenic TP53-knockout versions of the euploid AML cell line EEB to investigate the impact of TP53 on karyotype stability. We show that chromosome abnormalities spontaneously arise in TP53-deficient cells. Numerical aneuploidy could, to some extent, be propagated in a TP53-proficient setting, indicating that it does not necessarily trigger TP53 activation. In contrast, tolerance to structural chromosome aberrations was almost entirely restricted to TP53-knockout clones, all of which were able to continue proliferation in the presence of damaged DNA. Mechanistically, as a source of chromosome aberrations, limited numerical but not structural chromosomal instability was tolerated by TP53-wildtype cells. In contrast, structural instability was found only in TP53-knockout cells. Together, in myeloid cells TP53 loss allows for the development of complex karyotype aberrations and karyotype heterogeneity by perpetuation of chromosome segregation errors.","['Cazzola, Anna', 'Schlegel, Christin', 'Jansen, Ilka', 'Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Cazzola A', 'Schlegel C', 'Jansen I', 'Bochtler T', 'Jauch A', 'Kramer A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8232-9982'],"['Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Thoracic Oncology, Thoraxklinik Heidelberg, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. a.kraemer@dkfz.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. a.kraemer@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190823,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/25 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/08/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0550-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0550-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Nov;33(11):2619-2627. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0550-5.

Here, we find that hCINAP is involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB) and that its expression correlates with AML prognosis. Following DSB, hCINAP is recruited to damage sites where it promotes SENP3-dependent deSUMOylation of NPM1. This in turn results in the dissociation of RAP80 from the damage site and CTIP-dependent DNA resection and homologous recombination. NPM1 SUMOylation is required for recruitment of DNA repair proteins at the early stage of DNA-damage response (DDR), and SUMOylated NPM1 impacts the assembly of the BRCA1 complex. Knockdown of hCINAP also sensitizes a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model to chemotherapy. In clinical AML samples, low hCINAP expression is associated with a higher overall survival rate in patients. These results provide mechanistic insight into the function of hCINAP during the DNA-damage response and its role in AML resistance to therapy.","['Xu, Ruidan', 'Yu, Shuyu', 'Zhu, Dan', 'Huang,

Efficacy was determined on the basis of achievement and maintenance of steady-state nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) above 0.1 U/mL when using CALASP, 2,500 U/m(2) intravenously, every 3 weeks. In a randomized comparison to pegaspargase (PEGASP) every 2 weeks, treatment with CALASP every 3 weeks had a similar safety profile and no substantial impairment in event-free survival. The pharmacokinetics of CALASP were studied when administered in combination with multiagent chemotherapy in 124 patients with B-cell ALL in Study AALL07P4 and Study DFCI 11-001. The results showed that 123 [99%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 96%-100%] of the 124 patients maintained NSAA >0.1 U/mL at weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 of post-induction phase.

How tumor microenvironment influences clinical response to CAR T therapy remains of great interest. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation study of anti-CD19 JWCAR029 was conducted in refractory B-NHL (NCT03355859) and 10 patients received CAR T cells at an escalating dose of 2.5 x 10(7)(n = 3), 5 x 10(7)(n = 4), and 1 x 10(8)(n = 3) cells. Core needle biopsy was performed on tumor samples collected from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients on Day -6 (1 day before lymphodepletion) and on Day 11 after CAR T-cell infusion when adequate CAR T-cell expansion was detected. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 100%, with 6 of 9 (66.7%) evaluable patients achieving complete remission. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (10/10, 100%), anemia (3/10, 30%), thrombocytopenia (3/10, 30%), and hypofibrinogenemia (2/10, 20%). Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome occurred in all patients and grade 3 neurotoxicity in 1 patient. The average peak levels of peripheral blood CAR T cells and cytokines were similar in 3 different dose levels, but CAR T cells were significantly higher in patients achieved complete remission on Day 29. Meanwhile, RNA sequencing identified gene expression signatures differentially enriched in complete and partial remission patients. Increased tumor-associated macrophage infiltration was negatively associated with remission status. CONCLUSIONS: JWCAR029 was effective and safe in treating refractory B-NHL. The composition of the tumor microenvironment has a potential impact in CAR T therapy response.","['Yan, Zi-Xun', 'Li, Li', 'Wang, Wen', 'OuYang, Bin-Shen', 'Cheng, Shu', 'Wang, Li', 'Wu, Wen', 'Xu, Peng-Peng', 'Muftuoglu, Muharrem', 'Hao, Ming', 'Yang, Su', 'Zhang, Mu-Chen', 'Zheng, Zhong', 'Li, James', 'Zhao, Wei-Li']","['Yan ZX', 'Li L', 'Wang W', 'OuYang BS', 'Cheng S', 'Wang L', 'Wu W', 'Xu PP', 'Muftuoglu M', 'Hao M', 'Yang S', 'Zhang MC', 'Zheng Z', 'Li J', 'Zhao WL']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'JW Therapeutics, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Pole de Recherches Sino-Francais en Science du Vivant et Genomique, Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas - MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'JW Therapeutics, Shanghai, China.', 'JW Therapeutics, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'JW Therapeutics, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. zhao.weili@yahoo.com.', 'Pole de Recherches Sino-Francais en Science du Vivant et Genomique, Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190823,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,,2019/08/25 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/08/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-0101 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0101 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Dec 1;25(23):6995-7003. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0101.

Evidence is scarce on the risks of specific cardiovascular diseases in survivors of a wide range of cancers to inform prevention and management. In this study, we used large-scale electronic health records data from multiple linked UK databases to address these evidence gaps. METHODS: For this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary care, hospital, and cancer registry data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify cohorts of survivors of the 20 most common cancers who were 18 years or older and alive 12 months after diagnosis and controls without history of cancer, matched for age, sex, and general practice. We compared risks for a range of cardiovascular disease outcomes using crude and adjusted Cox models. We fitted interactions to investigate effect modification, and flexible parametric survival models to estimate absolute excess risks over time. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015, 126 120 individuals with a diagnosis of a cancer of interest still being followed up at least 1 year later were identified and matched to 630 144 controls. After exclusions, 108 215 cancer survivors and 523 541 controls were included in the main analyses. Venous thromboembolism risk was elevated in survivors of 18 of 20 site-specific cancers compared with that of controls; adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 1.72 (95% CI 1.57-1.89) in patients after prostate cancer to 9.72 (5.50-17.18) after pancreatic cancer. HRs decreased over time, but remained elevated more than 5 years after diagnosis. We observed increased risks of heart failure or cardiomyopathy in patients after ten of 20 cancers, including haematological (adjusted HR 1.94, 1.66-2.25, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 1.77, 1.50-2.09, with leukaemia; and 3.29, 2.59-4.18, with multiple myeloma), oesophageal (1.96, 1.46-2.64), lung (1.82, 1.52-2.17) kidney (1.73, 1.38-2.17) and ovarian (1.59, 1.19-2.12). Elevated risks of arrhythmia, pericarditis, coronary artery disease, stroke, and valvular heart disease were also observed for multiple cancers, including haematological malignancies. HRs for heart failure or cardiomyopathy and venous thromboembolism were greater in patients without previous cardiovascular disease and in younger patients. However, absolute excess risks were generally greater with increasing age. Increased risks of these outcomes seemed most pronounced in patients who had received chemotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Survivors of most site-specific cancers had increased medium-term to long-term risk for one or more cardiovascular diseases compared with that for the general population, with substantial variations between cancer sites.

Various techniques are available in the literature for the detection of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia from the single cell blood smear images. The purpose of this work is to develop an effective method for leukemia detection. METHODS: This work has developed deep learning based leukemia detection module from the blood smear images. Here, the detection scheme carries out pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The segmentation is done by the proposed Mutual Information (MI) based hybrid model, which combines the segmentation results of the active contour model and fuzzy C means algorithm. Then, from the segmented images, the statistical and the Local Directional Pattern (LDP) features are extracted and provided to the proposed Chronological Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) based Deep CNN classifier for the classification. RESULTS: For the experimentation, the blood smear images are considered from the AA-IDB2 database and evaluated based on metrics, such as True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and accuracy. Simulation results reveal that the proposed Chronological SCA based Deep CNN classifier has the accuracy of 98.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the proposed Chronological SCA-based Deep CNN classifier is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The analysis shows that the proposed classifier has comparatively improved performance and determines the leukemia from the blood smear images.","['Jha, Krishna Kumar', 'Dutta, Himadri Sekhar']","['Jha KK', 'Dutta HS']",,"['Calcutta Institute of Technology, Howrah, West Bengal, India.

This first-in-human study investigated the therapeutic use of samalizumab as a CD200 immune checkpoint inhibitor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-three patients with advanced CLL and 3 patients with MM were enrolled in an open-label phase 1 study (NCT00648739). Patients were assigned sequentially to one of 7 dose level cohorts (50 to 600 mg/m(2)) in a 3 + 3 study design, receiving a single dose of samalizumab intravenously once every 28 days. Primary endpoints were safety, identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints were samalizumab binding to CD200, pharmacodynamic effects on circulating tumor cells and leukocyte subsets, and clinical responses. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received > 1 treatment cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate in severity. Samalizumab produced dose-dependent decreases in CD200 expression on CLL cells and decreased frequencies of circulating CD200 + CD4+ T cells that were sustained at higher doses. The MTD was not reached. Decreased tumor burden was observed in 14 CLL patients. One CLL patient achieved a durable partial response and 16 patients had stable disease. All MM patients had disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Samalizumab had a good safety profile and treatment was associated with reduced tumor burden in a majority of patients with advanced CLL. These preliminary positive results support further development of samalizumab as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

The AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta pathway regulates cell metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, and reprogramming, and p16 and p21, which act downstream of this pathway, regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis induced by reprogramming. Here, we aimed to elucidate the roles of PBX1 in regulating the proliferation and reprogramming of HF-MSCs. METHODS: A lentiviral vector designed to carry the PBX1 sequence or PBX1 short hairpin RNA sequence was used to overexpress or knock down PBX1. The roles of PBX1 in proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate pluripotent gene expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to examine the transcriptional activity of the NANOG promoter. Western blotting was performed to identify the molecules downstream of PBX1 involved in proliferation and reprogramming. Caspase3 activity was detected to assess HF-MSC reprogramming. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT inhibitor LY294002 was used to inhibit the phosphorylation and activity of AKT. RESULTS: Overexpression of PBX1 in HF-MSCs increased the phosphorylation of AKT and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, resulting in the progression of the cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase. Moreover, transfection with a combination of five transcription factors (SOMKP) in HF-MSCs enhanced the formation of alkaline phosphatase-stained colonies compared with that in HF-MSCs transfected with a combination of four transcription factors (SOMK). PBX1 upregulated Nanog transcription by activating the promoter and promoted the expression of endogenous SOX2 and OCT4. Furthermore, PBX1 expression activated the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta pathway and reduced apoptosis during the early stages of reprogramming. Inhibition of phospho-AKT or knockdown of PBX1 promoted mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis and reduced reprogramming efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: PBX1 enhanced HF-MSC proliferation, and HF-MSCs induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) generation by activating the AKT/GSK3beta signaling pathway. During the reprogramming of HF-MSCs into HF-iPSCs, PBX1 activated the NANOG promoter, upregulated NANOG, and inhibited mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis via the AKT/GSK3beta pathway during the early stages of reprogramming.","['Jiang, Yixu', 'Liu, Feilin', 'Zou, Fei', 'Zhang, Yingyao', 'Wang, Bo', 'Zhang, Yuying', 'Lian, Aobo', 'Han, Xing', 'Liu, Zinan', 'Liu, Xiaomei', 'Jin, Minghua', 'Wang, Dianliang', 'Li, Gang', 'Liu, Jinyu']","['Jiang Y', 'Liu F', 'Zou F', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang B', 'Zhang Y', 'Lian A', 'Han X', 'Liu Z', 'Liu X', 'Jin M', 'Wang D', 'Li G', 'Liu J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1000-9434'],"['The Key Laboratory of Pathobiology, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Jilin University, 126 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Laboratory, PLA Rocket Force Characteristic Medical Center, Beijing, 100088, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedics & Traumatology, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, 999077, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Pathobiology, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Jilin University, 126 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China. jy_liu@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China. jy_liu@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190823,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,PMC6708256,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT', '*Apoptosis', '*Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta', '*Hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells', '*NANOG', '*PBX homeobox 1']",2019/08/25 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/08/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-019-1382-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-019-1382-y [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2019 Aug 23;10(1):268. doi: 10.1186/s13287-019-1382-y.,20200713,268,,"['0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hair Follicle/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, mother-child genotype combination gave 5.5-years delayed onset age in favor of DD-offspring of 677 CC-mothers vs. WW-offspring of 677 TT-mothers, and it was further confirmed including any D-carrier children and any 677 T-carrier mothers (P = 0.00052). Correction for multiple comparisons maintained statistical significance for DHFR ins/del and MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms. Unexpectedly, among the very-early onset group (<2.89 years; 25th), DD-genotype inversely clustered in children and mothers (4.8% vs. 23.8% respectively), and accordingly ALL offspring of homozygous DD-mothers had increased risk to have early-onset (adjusted OR (odds ratio) = 3.08; 1.1-8.6; P = 0.03). The opposite effect DHFR promoter variant has in tuning ALL onset-time depending on who is the carrier (i.e., mother or child) might suggest a parent-origin-effect of the D-allele or a two-faced epigenetic role driven by unbalanced folate isoform availability during the in-utero leukemogenesis responsible for the wide postnatal childhood ALL latency.","['Tisato, Veronica', 'Muggeo, Paola', 'Lupiano, Tracy', 'Longo, Giovanna', 'Serino, Maria Luisa', 'Grassi, Massimo', 'Arcamone, Ermanno', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Gemmati, Donato']","['Tisato V', 'Muggeo P', 'Lupiano T', 'Longo G', 'Serino ML', 'Grassi M', 'Arcamone E', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G', 'Santoro N', 'Gemmati D']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8448-066X'],"['Department of Morphology, Surgery & Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, University Hospital Policlinico, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical & Specialty Surgical Sciences, and Centre Haemostasis & Thrombosis, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical & Specialty Surgical Sciences, and Centre Haemostasis & Thrombosis, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical & Specialty Surgical Sciences, and Centre Haemostasis & Thrombosis, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, University Hospital Policlinico, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, University Hospital Policlinico, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery & Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery & Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, University Hospital Policlinico, 70124 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical & Specialty Surgical Sciences, and Centre Haemostasis & Thrombosis, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. d.gemmati@unife.it.', 'Center of Gender Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. d.gemmati@unife.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC6770441,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL onset', '*Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', '*DHFR', '*MTHFR', '*MTX', '*epigenetics', '*folate', '*mother-fetus in utero crosstalk', '*parent-origin effect (POE)', '*polymorphism/gene variant']",2019/08/25 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/08/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['genes10090634 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10090634 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Aug 22;10(9). pii: genes10090634. doi: 10.3390/genes10090634.,20200211,,,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Haplotypes', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Mothers', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Diarylheptanoids are the major constituents of the B. platyphylla bark and possess various pharmacological effects. Our previous study confirmed the selective antiproliferative effect of platyphylloside (BPP) isolated from B. platyphylla on colon cancer and leukemic cells using 60 different cancer cell lines from thr National Cancer Institution (NCI). In line with previous reports, this study focuses on the apoptotic pathway of BPP, a phenolic glycoside composed of two aromatic rings joined by a seven-carbon chain. Cytotoxicity assays in solid tumor and blood cancer cell models demonstrated that BPP possesses potent antiproliferative activity. The level of apoptosis increased with BPP treatment, causing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase along with the downregulation of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and BCL-2, as well as upregulation of cleaved caspase 3 and BAX proteins. In addition, BPP displayed potent mitochondrial depolarization effects in Jurkat cells. The combined findings revealed that the cytotoxic effects of BPP were mediated by intracellular signaling, possibly through a mechanism involving the upregulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, BPP could be a potential multitarget therapeutic agent in leukemia and colon cancer.","['Lee, Joo-Eun', 'Thuy, Nguyen Thi Thanh', 'Lee, Jina', 'Cho, Namki', 'Yoo, Hee Min']","['Lee JE', 'Thuy NTT', 'Lee J', 'Cho N', 'Yoo HM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5951-2137'],"['Stem Cell Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea.', 'Center for Bioanalysis, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea. cnamki@jnu.ac.kr.', 'Center for Bioanalysis, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Korea. hmy@kriss.re.kr.']",['eng'],"['KRISS - 2019 - GP2019-0009/Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science', 'NRF-2018R1C1B5083127/National Research Foundation of Korea', '2018-3487/Chonnam National University', '2012M3A9C/Korean National Research Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20190815,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC6720625,['NOTNLM'],"['Betula platyphylla', 'Jurkat cells', 'apoptosis', 'platyphylloside', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2019/08/25 06:00,2020/01/24 06:00,['2019/08/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24162960 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24162960 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Aug 15;24(16). pii: molecules24162960. doi: 10.3390/molecules24162960.,20200123,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diarylheptanoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (platyphylloside)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Betula/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Diarylheptanoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: One patient had aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. After allograft, the patient initially improved after withdrawing norepinephrine and renal replacement therapy but he subsequently died thirty-two days later because of a new relapse of the disease. The second patient had acute myeloid leukemia type 1 with a need for an allograft after a first complete remission. She was discharged from ICU at D23 after allograft and still alive 7months later with complete remission. For the two patients, allograft conditioning was performed before admission to our ICU. These two cases highlight one major problem in such situations which is to find the best time to perform the allograft, particularly in ventilated patients with septic shock and MOF. We performed the allograft when we thought that the risk-benefit ratio was in favor of restoring immunity. CONCLUSION: Allograft should be considered as a rescue therapy in ICU for patients with aplasia, during septic shock with multi-organ failure, however close multidisciplinary discussion is required between intensivists and onco-hematologists.","['Lepretre, Perrine', 'Clavier, Thomas', 'Menard, Anne-Lise', 'Grange, Steven', 'Girault, Christophe', 'Boyer, Deborah']","['Lepretre P', 'Clavier T', 'Menard AL', 'Grange S', 'Girault C', 'Boyer D']",,"['Department of Medical Intensive Care, Rouen University Hospital, 76000 Rouen, France.', 'Department of Medical Intensive Care, Rouen University Hospital, 76000 Rouen, France; Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, INSERM U1096, 76000 Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Henri-Becquerel Center, 76000 Rouen, France.', 'Department of Medical Intensive Care, Rouen University Hospital, 76000 Rouen, France.', 'Department of Medical Intensive Care, Rouen University Hospital, 76000 Rouen, France; Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, EA3830-GRHV, 76000 Rouen, France.', 'Department of Medical Intensive Care, Rouen University Hospital, 76000 Rouen, France.

Herein, a label-free electrochemical sensing system was proposed for the detection of the acute leukaemia Pax-5a gene based on enzyme-assisted signal amplification to generate abundant G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme. The presence of Pax-5a can open the hairpin probe (HP), which acts as a template. Under the action of the restriction enzymes Nt.BbvCI and Klenow fragment polymerase, the target gene Pax-5a is cycled to open the HP; On the other hand, a large number of G-quadruplex sequences are produced. The resulting G-quadruplex sequence is capable of forming the G-quadruplex/hemin complex on the surface of the electrode in the presence of hemin. The ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical detection of Pax-5a can be realized via the G-quadruplex/hemin complex-catalysed reduction of H2O2, and the detection limit was estimated to be as low as 4.6fM. In addition, the biosensor has good specificity and stability, and also has excellent detection capabilities in a complex substrate environment. Therefore, the sensor shows great potential in bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.","['Zhao, Weihua', 'Liu, Mingbin', 'Li, Hongbo', 'Wang, Suqin', 'Tang, Shasha', 'Kong, Rong-Mei', 'Yu, Ruqin']","['Zhao W', 'Liu M', 'Li H', 'Wang S', 'Tang S', 'Kong RM', 'Yu R']",,"['Key Laboratory of Functional Small Organic Molecule, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Functional Small Organic Molecule, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Functional Small Organic Molecule, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, PR China.

We present a case of concurrent cutaneous localization of Langerhans cell sarcoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, in which the chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma preceded the development of the Langerhans cell sarcoma. A cutaneous lesion from a 63-year-old patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma was biopsied. The histologic examination revealed a mixture of two cell populations infiltrating diffusely the dermis. The first was composed of small lymphoid cells with somewhat monotonous appearance and mild nuclear atypia positive for PAX5, CD79a, CD20, CD23, CD5, and LEF1. The second was composed of large cells with abundant cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. These cells were positive for CD1a, CD207, and S100 protein and exhibited a high mitotic rate and a high MIB-1 immunostaining index. Therefore, two different entities, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and Langerhans cell sarcoma, were detected in the same skin fragment.

Low expression of TET2 has been reported as a prognostic factor for several types of malignancies in adult patients. However, there have been few data on the effect of TET2 mRNA level on the prognosis of children with ALL so far. METHODS: In this study, TET2 expression of samples cryopreserved in the liquid nitrogen from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011 was retrospectively analyzed in 136 newly diagnosed ALL patients by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The patients' samples were divided into two groups by the median value of patients group and divided into TET2 low and TET2 high groups. RESULTS: A total of 136 childhood ALL patients demonstrated lower TET2 expression than control group (P = .038). TET2 mRNA expression levels were correlated with the disease status. In addition, patients with low TET2 expression had lower platelet counts and lower CR rates. Survival analysis showed that low TET2 expression in children with ALL was associated with lower 5-year overall survival (OS) (63% vs 88%, P = .011) and event-free survival (EFS) (60% vs 85%, P = .003). Multivariate analysis revealed that low TET2 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor of OS and EFS. CONCLUSION: Low expression of TET2 in children with ALL is associated with poor prognosis and can be used as a molecular prognostic marker for risk group stratification.","['Zhang, Ping', 'Weng, Wen-Wen', 'Chen, Ping', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Ruan, Jin-Fei', 'Ba, Dian-Dian', 'Xu, Wei-Qun', 'Tang, Yong-Min']","['Zhang P', 'Weng WW', 'Chen P', 'Zhang Y', 'Ruan JF', 'Ba DD', 'Xu WQ', 'Tang YM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1409-5517'],"[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['201464783/Zhejiang Science and Technology Department', '2019C03032/Zhejiang Science and Technology Department', '81470304/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81770202/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20190823,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['TET2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'expression', 'prognosis']",2019/08/24 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13099 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2019 Oct;41(5):702-709. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13099.

METHODS: A retrospective case note audit of patients admitted to Flinders Medical Centre from 2013 to 2017 was conducted. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years and above, received chemotherapy and were neutropenic during admission. Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. Primary outcomes were occurrence of infections and fever. Secondary outcomes include hospital length of stay and infection-related mortality. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients received ND while 75 patients received LD. The ND group had more patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (p < .001) and receiving high-toxicity chemotherapy (p = .005). Incidence of febrile neutropenia (p = .016), bacteraemia (p = .044) and number of febrile days (p = .033) was higher in the ND group. ND was not independently associated with occurrence of febrile neutropenia or infections. Subsample analysis of 20 pairs of patients matched on age, sex and cancer diagnosis found no significant differences in clinical outcomes between groups. CONCLUSION: ND was not associated with the prevention of adverse outcomes in chemotherapy patients.","['Heng, Mei Shan', 'Barbon Gauro, Jessica', 'Yaxley, Alison', 'Thomas, Jolene']","['Heng MS', 'Barbon Gauro J', 'Yaxley A', 'Thomas J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1979-0068'],"['Nutrition and Dietetics, College of Nursing and Health Science, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, SA, Australia.', 'Nutrition and Dietetics, College of Nursing and Health Science, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Nutrition and Dietetics, College of Nursing and Health Science, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190823,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'diet', 'infection', 'neoplasm', 'neutropenia']",2019/08/24 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.13155 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2020 Jan;29(1):e13155. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13155.

RECENT FINDINGS: Additional data support the finding that both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are important complications of cancer or its treatment. Reperfusion therapy is being given successfully to patients with stroke complicating cancer. Hemorrhagic stroke may occur with metastatic disease to the brain, coagulopathies from cancer, in particular leukemia, or as complications of chemotherapy. Ischemic stroke also may be a complication of metastatic disease with local invasion of vessels, a pro-thrombotic disorder such as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or secondary to chemotherapy. Stroke also is a potential consequence of radiation therapy to the head and neck. Venous sinus thrombosis may develop with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy. Although many patients will have a history of cancer at the time of stroke, a cerebrovascular event may be the initial manifestation of a malignancy.","['Adams, Harold P Jr']",['Adams HP Jr'],,"['Division of Cerebrovascular Diseases, Department of Neurology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA. harold-adams@uiowa.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190823,United States,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,Current neurology and neuroscience reports,100931790,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Disseminated intravascular coagulation', '*Intracerebral hemorrhage', '*Ischemic stroke', '*Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis', '*Venous sinus thrombosis']",2019/08/24 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11910-019-0985-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11910-019-0985-0 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep. 2019 Aug 23;19(10):73. doi: 10.1007/s11910-019-0985-0.,20200603,73,,,IM,"['Brain/pathology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/*etiology', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Stroke/complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority, up to 99%, transform into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with a small subset (<1%) becoming classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately half of RT cases progress through a pathway involving dysregulation of C-MYC. High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) is a recent diagnostic category of aggressive B-cell lymphomas set forth in the updated 2017 WHO Classification of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, formerly ""double-hit"" and ""triple-hit"" lymphomas, comprise the majority of HGBL cases. Patients with HGBL have a worse prognosis than those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We present a case of RT with rearrangements of MYC and BCL6.

Patients and methods: Serum collected from 20 newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, 20 T-cell ALL and 20 healthy children. The peptides from these samples were subjected to iTRAQ. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were further validated by ELISA in 24 B-ALL, 24 T-ALL, and 24 healthy children. Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed several pathways, including atherosclerosis signaling, interleukin signaling and production in macrophages and clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, that were closely related to childhood T-cell ALL. Furthermore, four selected proteins, namely LRG1, S100A8, SPARC and sL-selectin, were verified by ELISA. These results were consistent with the results of the proteomics analysis. Conclusion: Serum S100A8 may serve as new diagnostic biomarkers in childhood B-cell ALL and T-cell ALL.","['Yu, Runhong', 'Zhang, Jingyu', 'Zang, Yuzhu', 'Zeng, Li', 'Zuo, Wenli', 'Bai, Yanliang', 'Liu, Yanhui', 'Sun, Kai', 'Liu, Yufeng']","['Yu R', 'Zhang J', 'Zang Y', 'Zeng L', 'Zuo W', 'Bai Y', 'Liu Y', 'Sun K', 'Liu Y']",,"[""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190725,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC6664257,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell ALL', 'T-cell ALL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'ingenuity pathways analysis', 'isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation', 'proteomics', 'serum']",2019/08/24 06:00,2019/08/24 06:01,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S210093 [doi]', '210093 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Jul 25;11:7047-7063. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S210093. eCollection 2019.,,7047-7063,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we used an in vivo murine Vk*MYC myeloma model where CD138 is heterogeneously expressed depending on tumor size. We find that in comparison to CD138-neg myeloma cells, the CD138-high subset of myeloma cells is highly proliferative, less apoptotic, and enhanced IL-6R signaling, which is known to promote survival. In addition CD138-high myeloma engrafts better than its CD138-neg counterpart. In contrast, CD138-neg cells are more motile both in vitro and in vivo, and more readily disseminate and spread to other bones in vivo than CD138-high subset. Neutralizing CD138 rapidly triggers migration of myeloma cells in vivo and leads to intravasation, which results in increased dissemination to other bones. Both murine and human myeloma cells can rapidly recycle CD138 surface expression through endocytic trafficking, in response to serum levels. Blocking CD138 enhances myeloma sensitivity to bortezomib chemotherapy and significantly reduces tumor size compared to bortezomib treatment alone. Thus, our data show that CD138 surface expression dynamically regulates a switch between growth vs. dissemination for myeloma, in response to nutrient conditions.","['Akhmetzyanova, Ilseyar', 'McCarron, Mark J', 'Parekh, Samir', 'Chesi, Marta', 'Bergsagel, P Leif', 'Fooksman, David R']","['Akhmetzyanova I', 'McCarron MJ', 'Parekh S', 'Chesi M', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Fooksman DR']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9907-2845', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4024-8225']","['Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.

To target the IL-7 receptor on T-ALL cells, murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were developed against the human IL-7Ralpha chain and chimerized with human IgG1 constant regions. Crystal structures demonstrate that the two MAbs bound different IL-7Ralpha epitopes. The MAbs mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against patient-derived xenograft (PDX) T-ALL cells, which was improved by combining two MAbs. In vivo, the MAbs showed therapeutic efficacy via ADCC-dependent and independent mechanisms in minimal residual and established disease. PDX T-ALL cells that relapsed following a course of chemotherapy displayed elevated IL-7Ralpha, and MAb treatment is effective against relapsing disease, suggesting the use of anti-IL7Ralpha MAbs in relapsed T-ALL patients or patients that do not respond to chemotherapy.","['Hixon, Julie A', 'Andrews, Caroline', 'Kashi, Lila', 'Kohnhorst, Casey L', 'Senkevitch, Emilee', 'Czarra, Kelli', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Li, Wenqing', 'Schneider, Joel P', 'Walsh, Scott T R', 'Durum, Scott K']","['Hixon JA', 'Andrews C', 'Kashi L', 'Kohnhorst CL', 'Senkevitch E', 'Czarra K', 'Barata JT', 'Li W', 'Schneider JP', 'Walsh STR', 'Durum SK']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4826-8976'],"['Cytokines and Immunity Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program (CIP), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Cytokines and Immunity Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program (CIP), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Comparative Biomedical Scientist Training Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Cytokines and Immunity Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program (CIP), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Cytokines and Immunity Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program (CIP), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Cytokines and Immunity Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program (CIP), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Laboratory, NCI, NIH, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, Rockville, MD, USA. walshst@nih.gov.', 'Chemical Biology Laboratory, NCI, NIH, Frederick, MD, USA. walshst@nih.gov.', 'Cytokines and Immunity Section, Cancer and Inflammation Program (CIP), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD, USA. durums@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Z01 BC009287/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011150/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190822,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC8132108,,,2019/08/24 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0531-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0531-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):35-49. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0531-8.

The mechanism of PML nuclear body biogenesis remains elusive. Here, PMLRBCC is successfully purified. The gel filtration and ultracentrifugation analysis suggest a previously unrecognized sequential oligomerization mechanism via PML monomer, dimer, tetramer and N-mer. Consistently, PML B1-box structure (2.0 A) and SAXS characterization reveal an unexpected networking by W157-, F158- and SD1-interfaces. Structure-based perturbations in these B1 interfaces not only impair oligomerization in vitro but also abolish PML sumoylation and nuclear body biogenesis in HeLa(Pml-/-) cell. More importantly, as demonstrated by in vivo study using transgenic mice, PML-RARalpha (PR) F158E precludes leukemogenesis. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing analysis shows that B1 oligomerization is an important regulator in PML-RARalpha-driven transactivation. Altogether, these results not only define a previously unrecognized B1-box oligomerization in PML, but also highlight oligomerization as an important factor in carcinogenesis.","['Li, Yuwen', 'Ma, Xiaodan', 'Chen, Zhiming', 'Wu, Haiyan', 'Wang, Pengran', 'Wu, Wenyu', 'Cheng, Nuo', 'Zeng, Longhui', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Cai, Xun', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Meng, Guoyu']","['Li Y', 'Ma X', 'Chen Z', 'Wu H', 'Wang P', 'Wu W', 'Cheng N', 'Zeng L', 'Zhang H', 'Cai X', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Meng G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7904-2382'],"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, 200025, China. guoyumeng@shsmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC6706441,,,2019/08/24 06:00,2020/01/01 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-11746-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-11746-0 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Aug 22;10(1):3789. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-11746-0.,20191231,3789,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Protein Domains/genetics', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Scattering, Small Angle', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Sumoylation', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the diversity in drug responses in the major hematopoietic cell types, we simultaneously assessed their sensitivity to 71 small molecules utilizing a multi-parametric flow cytometry assay and mapped their proteomic and basal signaling profiles. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified distinct drug responses in healthy cell subsets based on their cellular lineage. Compared to other cell types, CD19(+)/B and CD56(+)/NK cells were more sensitive to dexamethasone, venetoclax and midostaurin, while monocytes were more sensitive to trametinib. Venetoclax exhibited dose-dependent cell selectivity that inversely correlated to STAT3 phosphorylation. Lineage specific effect of midostaurin was similarly detected in CD19(+)/B cells from healthy, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Comparison of drug responses in healthy and neoplastic cells showed that healthy cell responses are predictive of the corresponding malignant cell response. Taken together, understanding drug sensitivity in the healthy cell-of-origin provides opportunities to obtain a new level of therapy precision and avoid off-target toxicity.","['Majumder, Muntasir M', 'Leppa, Aino-Maija', 'Hellesoy, Monica', 'Dowling, Paul', 'Malyutina, Alina', 'Kopperud, Reidun', 'Bazou, Despina', 'Andersson, Emma', 'Parsons, Alun', 'Tang, Jing', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Mustjoki, Satu', ""O'Gorman, Peter"", 'Wennerberg, Krister', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T', 'Heckman, Caroline A']","['Majumder MM', 'Leppa AM', 'Hellesoy M', 'Dowling P', 'Malyutina A', 'Kopperud R', 'Bazou D', 'Andersson E', 'Parsons A', 'Tang J', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Mustjoki S', ""O'Gorman P"", 'Wennerberg K', 'Porkka K', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Heckman CA']",,"['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland muntasir.mamun@helsinki.fi.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biology, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Ireland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'BRIC-Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland caroline.heckman@helsinki.fi.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7271564,,,2019/08/24 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.217414 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.217414 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jun;105(6):1527-1538. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.217414.

Since long-term response to chemotherapy in these leukemias is relatively good, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered in patients who relapse and achieve second complete remission. To evaluate the outcomes of allogeneic transplantation in this indication, we studied 631 patients reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry between the years 2000 and 2014. Leukemia-free survival probabilities at two and five years were 59.1% and 54.1%, while overall survival probabilities were 65% and 58.2%, respectively. The incidence of relapse and risk of non-relapse mortality at the same time points were 19.8% and 22.5% for relapse and 20.9% and 23.3% for non-relapse mortality, respectively. The most important adverse factors influencing leukemia-free and overall survival were: leukemia with t(8;21), presence of three or more additional chromosomal abnormalities, and Karnofsky performance score <80. Relapse risk was increased in t(8;21) leukemia and associated with additional cytogenetic abnormalities as well as reduced intensity conditioning.

This work focuses on the t(8;22)(p11;q11) chromosomal translocation which creates the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) fibroblast growth factor receptor1 (FGFR1) (BCR-FGFR1) fusion protein. This fusion occurs in stem cell leukemia/lymphoma, which can progress to atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or B-cell lymphoma. This work focuses on the biochemical characterization of BCR-FGFR1 and identification of novel therapeutic targets. The tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR1 is required for biological activity as shown using transformation assays, interleukin-3 independent cell proliferation, and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analyses. Furthermore, BCR contributes a coiled-coil oligomerization domain, also essential for oncogenic transformation by BCR-FGFR1. The importance of salt bridge formation within the coiled-coil domain is demonstrated, as disruption of three salt bridges abrogates cellular transforming ability. Lastly, BCR-FGFR1 acts as a client of the chaperonin heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), suggesting that BCR-FGFR1 relies on Hsp90 complex to evade proteasomal degradation. Transformed cells expressing BCR-FGFR1 are sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor Ganetespib, and also respond to combined treatment with Ganetespib plus the FGFR inhibitor BGJ398. Collectively, these data suggest novel therapeutic approaches for future stem cell leukemia/lymphoma treatment: inhibition of BCR oligomerization by disruption of required salt bridges; and inhibition of the chaperonin Hsp90 complex.","['Peiris, Malalage N', 'Meyer, April N', 'Nelson, Katelyn N', 'Bisom-Rapp, Ezra W', 'Donoghue, Daniel J']","['Peiris MN', 'Meyer AN', 'Nelson KN', 'Bisom-Rapp EW', 'Donoghue DJ']",,"['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego ddonoghue@ucsd.edu.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA030199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7193502,,,2019/08/24 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.220871 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.220871 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1262-1273. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.220871.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Biochemical assays were used to test enzymatic activity inhibition of purinostat mesylate. Ph(+) leukemic cell lines and patient cells were used to evaluate purinostat mesylate activity in vitro. BL-2 secondary transplantation Ph(+) B-ALL mouse model was used to validate its efficacy, mechanism, and pharmacokinetics properties in vivo. BCR-ABL(T315I)-induced primary B-ALL mouse model and PDX mouse model derived from relapsed Ph(+) B-ALL patient post TKI treatment were used to determine the antitumor effect of purinostat mesylate for refractory or relapsed Ph(+) B-ALL. Long-term toxicity and hERG blockade assays were used to safety evaluation of purinostat mesylate. RESULTS: Purinostat mesylate, a class I and IIb HDAC highly selective inhibitor, exhibited robust antitumor activity in hematologic cancers. Purinostat mesylate at low nanomolar concentration induced apoptosis, and downregulated BCR-ABL and c-MYC expression in Ph(+) leukemia cell lines and primary Ph(+) B-ALL cells from relapsed patients. Purinostat mesylate efficiently attenuated Ph(+) B-ALL progression and significantly prolonged the survival both in BL-2 secondary transplantation model with clinical patient symptoms of Ph(+) B-ALL, BCR-ABL(T315I)-induced primary B-ALL mouse model, and PDX model derived from patients with relapsed Ph(+) B-ALL post TKI treatment. In addition, purinostat mesylate possesses favorable pharmacokinetics and low toxicity properties. CONCLUSIONS: Purinostat mesylate provides a new therapeutic strategy for patients with Ph(+) B-ALL, including those who relapse after TKI treatment.","['Yang, Linyu', 'Qiu, Qiang', 'Tang, Minghai', 'Wang, Fang', 'Yi, Yuyao', 'Yi, Dongni', 'Yang, Zhuang', 'Zhu, Zejiang', 'Zheng, Shoujun', 'Yang, Jianhong', 'Pei, Heying', 'Zheng, Li', 'Chen, Yong', 'Gou, Liping', 'Luo, Liya', 'Deng, Xing', 'Ye, Haoyu', 'Hu, Yiguo', 'Niu, Ting', 'Chen, Lijuan']","['Yang L', 'Qiu Q', 'Tang M', 'Wang F', 'Yi Y', 'Yi D', 'Yang Z', 'Zhu Z', 'Zheng S', 'Yang J', 'Pei H', 'Zheng L', 'Chen Y', 'Gou L', 'Luo L', 'Deng X', 'Ye H', 'Hu Y', 'Niu T', 'Chen L']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Research Laboratory of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Research Laboratory of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. chenlijuan125@163.com tingniu@sina.com huyiguo@scu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. chenlijuan125@163.com tingniu@sina.com huyiguo@scu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology and Research Laboratory of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. chenlijuan125@163.com tingniu@sina.com huyiguo@scu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,,2019/08/24 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-0516 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0516 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Dec 15;25(24):7527-7539. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0516.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. MacroH2A1.1 is a histone H2A variant that negatively correlates with the self-renewal capacity of embryonic, adult, and cancer stem cells. MacroH2A1.1 is a target of the frequent U2AF1 S34F mutation in MDS. The role of macroH2A1.1 in hematopoiesis is unclear. RESULTS: MacroH2A1.1 mRNA levels are significantly decreased in patients with low-risk MDS presenting with chromosomal 5q deletion and myeloid cytopenias and tend to be decreased in MDS patients carrying the U2AF1 S34F mutation. Using an innovative mouse allele lacking the macroH2A1.1 alternatively spliced exon, we investigated whether macroH2A1.1 regulates HSC homeostasis and differentiation. The lack of macroH2A1.1 decreased while macroH2A1.1 haploinsufficiency increased HSC frequency upon irradiation. Moreover, bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that both deficiency and haploinsufficiency of macroH2A1.1 resulted in enhanced HSC differentiation along the myeloid lineage. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis implicated macroH2A1.1-mediated regulation of ribosomal gene expression in HSC homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings suggest a new epigenetic process contributing to hematopoiesis regulation. By combining clinical data with a discrete mutant mouse model and in vitro studies of human and mouse cells, we identify macroH2A1.1 as a key player in the cellular and molecular features of MDS. These data justify the exploration of macroH2A1.1 and associated proteins as therapeutic targets in hematological malignancies.","['Bereshchenko, Oxana', 'Lo Re, Oriana', 'Nikulenkov, Fedor', 'Flamini, Sara', 'Kotaskova, Jana', 'Mazza, Tommaso', 'Le Pannerer, Marguerite-Marie', 'Buschbeck, Marcus', 'Giallongo, Cesarina', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe', 'Li Volti, Giovanni', 'Pazienza, Valerio', 'Cervinek, Libor', 'Riccardi, Carlo', 'Krejci, Lumir', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Vinciguerra, Manlio']","['Bereshchenko O', 'Lo Re O', 'Nikulenkov F', 'Flamini S', 'Kotaskova J', 'Mazza T', 'Le Pannerer MM', 'Buschbeck M', 'Giallongo C', 'Palumbo G', 'Li Volti G', 'Pazienza V', 'Cervinek L', 'Riccardi C', 'Krejci L', 'Pospisilova S', 'Stewart AF', 'Vinciguerra M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1768-3894'],"['Department of Medicine, Department of Philosophy, Social Sciences and Education, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. oxana.bereshchenko@unipg.it.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St'Anne University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St'Anne University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medicine, Department of Philosophy, Social Sciences and Education, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital Brno and Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, Bioinformatics unit, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Campus ICO-Germans Trias I Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Programme of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC), Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Campus ICO-Germans Trias I Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Programme of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (PMPPC-IGTP), Badalona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

There is no disease-specific difference in viral strains, and it is unclear how HTLV-1 causes such different diseases manifesting as lymphoproliferation or inflammation. Although some progress has been made in therapies for these diseases, the prognosis for ATL is still dismal and HAM/TSP remains an intractable disease. So far, two regulatory proteins of HTLV-1, Tax and HBZ, have been well studied and shown to have pleiotropic functions implicated in viral pathogenesis. Tax in particular can strongly activate NFkappaB, which is constitutively activated in HTLV-1-infected cells and considered to contribute to both oncogenesis and inflammation. However, the expression level of Tax is very low in vivo, leading to confusion in understanding its role in viral pathogenesis. A series of studies using IL-2-dependent HTLV-1-infected cells indicated that IL-10, an anti-inflammatory/immune suppressive cytokine, could induce a proliferative phenotype in HTLV-1-infected cells. In addition, type I interferon (IFN) suppresses HTLV-1 expression in a reversible manner. These findings suggest involvement of host innate immunity in the switch between lymphoproliferative and inflammatory diseases as well as the regulation of HTLV-1 expression. Innate immune responses also affect another important host determinant, Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are impaired in ATL patients, while activated in HAM/TSP patients. Activation of Tax-specific CTLs in ATL patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation indicates Tax expression and its fluctuation in vivo. A recently developed anti-ATL therapeutic vaccine, consisting of Tax peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, induced Tax-specific CTL responses in ATL patients and exhibited favorable clinical outcomes, unless Tax-defective ATL clones emerged. These findings support the significance of Tax in HTLV-1 pathogenesis, at least in part, and encourage Tax-targeted immunotherapy in ATL. Host innate and acquired immune responses induce host microenvironments that modify HTLV-1-encoded pathogenesis and establish a complicated network for development of diseases in HTLV-1 infection. Both host and viral factors should be taken into consideration in development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies in HTLV-1 infection.","['Kannagi, Mari', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Nagano, Yoshiko', 'Kimpara, Shuichi', 'Suehiro, Youko']","['Kannagi M', 'Hasegawa A', 'Nagano Y', 'Kimpara S', 'Suehiro Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3433-2658'],"['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan. kann.impt@tmd.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190822,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC6704564,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*Acquired immunity', '*CTL', '*Dendritic cell', '*HTLV-1', '*IL-10', '*Innate immunity', '*Interferon', '*Tax', '*Tumor vaccine']",2019/08/24 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0484-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0484-z [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Aug 22;16(1):23. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0484-z.,20200309,23,,,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/therapy', 'Host Microbial Interactions/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a universal agreement that LSCs lie within the CD34+ compartment of hemopoietic cells and most of leukemic stem cells express the interleukin-3 alpha chain receptor, CD123 and lack CD38. This study aimed to estimate the expression of LSC phenotype in AML patients and to correlate it with response to induction therapy. METHODS: A cohort of 41 patients older than 15 years with newly diagnosed de novo AML were enrolled in this study. They were obtained from the National center of hematology in Baghdad and Baghdad teaching hospital between February and July 2013. The expression of CD34, CD38 and CD123 was assessed by multi-color flow cytometry. LSC positive (LSC+) samples must express CD34 and CD123 and lack the expression of CD38 in >1% of cells. French American British (FAB) classification system was used in this study. After four weeks of induction therapy; three groups were found: those who reached the Complete morphological Remission (CR), those who failed to reach CR and those who died before the assessment of morphological remission. The last two groups were merged for statistical purposes. RESULTS: After the course of induction therapy, 41.46% of patients had complete morphological remission while 58.54% of the studied patients failed to reach complete remission. The Complete Remission (CR) rate was higher (53.33%) in patients who were negative for LSC phenotype than patients who were positive for LSC phenotype (34.61%). CONCLUSION: LSCs were expressed in 63.41% of AML cases and were in approximate distribution in FAB M3 and non-M3 patients. The expression of LSC phenotype was associated with poor response to induction therapy in AML patients.","['Almohsen, Faez', 'Al-Mudallal, Subh S']","['Almohsen F', 'Al-Mudallal SS']",,"['Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Baghdad University College of Medicine, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Al-Nahrain University Medical College, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CD123', '*LSC', '*anemia', '*leukemia stem cells', '*neutropenia.']",2019/08/24 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['CHDDT-EPUB-99771 [pii]', '10.2174/1871529X19666190719105954 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2020;20(2):145-151. doi: 10.2174/1871529X19666190719105954.,20210322,145-151,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the incorporation of risk-adapted therapy and the arrival of new directed agents, the cure rate and survival of patients with ALL have improved dramatically, get near to 90%. In Latin American countries, the mortality rates of ALL are high, for example in Colombia, during the last decade, ALL has been the most prevalent cancer among children between 0-14 years of age. In the face of this public health problem and coupled with the fact that the knowledge of the proteome of the child population is little, our investigation proposes the study of the plasma proteome of Colombian children diagnosed with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) to determine potential disease markers that could reflect processes altered by the presence of the disease or in response to it. A proteomic study by LC-MS/MS and quantification by label-free methods were performed in search of proteins differentially expressed between healthy children and those diagnosed with B-ALL. We quantified a total of 472 proteins in depleted blood plasma, and 25 of these proteins were differentially expressed (fold change >2, Bonferroni-adjusted P-values <0.05). Plasma Aggrecan core protein, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, coagulation factor XIII A chain and gelsolin protein were examined by ELISA assay and compared to shotgun proteomics results. Our data provide new information on the plasma proteome of Colombian children. Additionally, these proteins may also have certain potential as illness markers or as therapeutic targets in subsequent investigations.","['Calderon-Rodriguez, Sandra Isabel', 'Sanabria-Salas, Maria Carolina', 'Umana-Perez, Adriana']","['Calderon-Rodriguez SI', 'Sanabria-Salas MC', 'Umana-Perez A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9262-2699'],"['Universidad Nacional de Colombia-Sede Bogota, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Quimica, Grupo de investigacion en Hormonas, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.', 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia-Sede Bogota, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Quimica, Grupo de investigacion en Hormonas, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.', 'Subdireccion de Investigaciones, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Colombia, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.', 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia-Sede Bogota, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Quimica, Grupo de investigacion en Hormonas, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6705836,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0221509 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-32351 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Aug 22;14(8):e0221509. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221509. eCollection 2019.,20200303,e0221509,,['0 (Blood Proteins)'],IM,"['Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Female', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Protein Interaction Maps', '*Proteomics']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

This epidemiologic profile can mainly be attributed to the availability of diagnostic resources. In Brazil, leukemia diagnosis is a challenge due to financial viability, lack of hemovigilance services in isolated regions and the vast size of the territory. Its incidence in the state of Amazonas has been increasing since 2010. Therefore, this study aims to describe the epidemiological pattern and spatial distribution of patients with acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in Amazonas and identify the predictors of comorbidity and death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out based on patients' data which was obtained from the database of a referral center for the period of 2005 to 2015. Variables included age, gender, ethnicity, civil status, schooling, income, location of residence, subtype of leukemia, comorbidities, and date of death. The spatial distribution was performed using QGIS v.2.18. Stata software was used for univariable and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between both comorbidities and death for all characteristic groups of ALL and AML. RESULTS: The group that was studied was composed of 577 ALL and 266 AML patients. For both, most patients were male, with a schooling period of 1-4 years, received<1 minimum wage, and lived mostly in Manaus, followed by the municipality of Tefe. There was no association between the development of comorbidities and analyzed variables in patients with ALL. AML patients that were >60 years old and with family history of the disease had the highest risk of developing comorbidities (OR = 5.06, p = 0.038; OR = 2.44, p = 0.041, respectively). Furthermore, patients with ALL and in the 41-50-year age group had a higher risk of death (OR = 31.12; p = 0.001). No association between death and explanatory variables were found in patients with AML. In addition, significant difference was observed in time to death (chi2 = 4,098.32, p = 0.000), with 50% of patients with AML dying within two years after diagnosis, whereas in ALL, this percentual of death only is reached in approximately 5 years. CONCLUSION: Our study describes the data of patients with acute leukemia in Amazonas, a remote region in the north of Brazil. In addition, it highlights the importance of hemovigilance in an Amazon region state, while focusing on peripheral areas which don't have prevention, diagnosis and treatment tools for this disease.","['Silva-Junior, Alexander Leonardo', 'Alves, Fabiola Silva', 'Kerr, Marlon Wendell Athaydes', 'Xabregas, Lilyane Amorim', 'Gama, Fabio Magalhaes', 'Rodrigues, Maria Gabriela Almeida',

Tagraxofusp (SL-401) is a CD123-targeted therapy consisting of interleukin-3 fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin payload. Factors influencing response to tagraxofusp other than CD123 expression are largely unknown. We interrogated tagraxofusp resistance in patients and experimental models and found that it was not associated with CD123 loss. Rather, resistant AML and BPDCN cells frequently acquired deficiencies in the diphthamide synthesis pathway, impairing tagraxofusp's ability to ADP-ribosylate cellular targets. Expression of DPH1, encoding a diphthamide pathway enzyme, was reduced by DNA CpG methylation in resistant cells. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine restored DPH1 expression and tagraxofusp sensitivity. We also developed a drug-dependent ADP-ribosylation assay in primary cells that correlated with tagraxofusp activity and may represent an additional novel biomarker. As predicted by these results and our observation that resistance also increased mitochondrial apoptotic priming, we found that the combination of tagraxofusp and azacitidine was effective in patient-derived xenografts treated in vivo. These data have important implications for clinical use of tagraxofusp and led to a phase 1 study combining tagraxofusp and azacitidine in myeloid malignancies.","['Togami, Katsuhiro', 'Pastika, Timothy', 'Stephansky, Jason', 'Ghandi, Mahmoud', 'Christie, Amanda L', 'Jones, Kristen L', 'Johnson, Carl A', 'Lindsay, Ross W', 'Brooks, Christopher L', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Craig, Jeffrey W', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Montero, Joan', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Johannessen, Cory M', 'Lane, Andrew A']","['Togami K', 'Pastika T', 'Stephansky J', 'Ghandi M', 'Christie AL', 'Jones KL', 'Johnson CA', 'Lindsay RW', 'Brooks CL', 'Letai A', 'Craig JW', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Weinstock DM', 'Montero J', 'Aster JC', 'Johannessen CM', 'Lane AA']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Stemline Therapeutics, New York, New York, USA.', 'Stemline Therapeutics, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA225191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC6819120,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Molecular biology', '*Oncology', '*Toxins/drugs/xenobiotics']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['128571 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI128571 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Nov 1;129(11):5005-5019. doi: 10.1172/JCI128571.,20200608,5005-5019,,"['0 (DPH1 protein, human)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '8ZHS5657EH (tagraxofusp)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,['J Clin Invest. 2019 Nov 1;129(11):4590-4592.

Here, we sought to assess the predictive capacity of the gastrointestinal microbiome and its relationship to infectious outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: 16s rRNA-based analysis was performed on oral swabs and stool samples obtained biweekly from baseline until neutrophil recovery following induction chemotherapy (IC) in 97 AML patients. Microbiome characteristics were correlated with clinical outcomes both during and after IC completion. RESULTS: At the start of IC, higher stool Shannon diversity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], .18-.74) and higher relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, .18-.73) were associated with increased probability of remaining infection-free during neutropenia. A baseline stool Shannon diversity cutoff of <2 had optimal operating characteristics for predicting infectious complications during neutropenia. Although 56 patients received therapy >72 hours with a carbapenem, none of the patients had an infection with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organism. Patients who received carbapenems for >72 hours had significantly lower alpha-diversity at neutrophil recovery (P = .001) and were approximately 4 times more likely to have infection in the 90 days following neutrophil recovery (HR, 4.55; 95% CI, 1.73-11.93). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gut microbiome evaluation could assist with infectious risk stratification and that improved targeting of antibiotic administration during IC could decrease subsequent infectious complications in AML patients.Baseline microbiome diversity is a strong independent predictor of infection during acute myeloid leukemia induction chemotherapy (IC) among clinical and microbiome covariates. Higher baseline levels of Porphyromonadaceae appear protective against infection, while carbapenem use is associated with consequences to the microbiome and infection susceptibility post-IC.","['Galloway-Pena, Jessica R', 'Shi, Yushu', 'Peterson, Christine B', 'Sahasrabhojane, Pranoti', 'Gopalakrishnan, Vancheswaran', 'Brumlow, Chelcy E', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Alfayez, Mansour', 'Boddu, Prajwal C', 'Khan, Md Abdul Wadud', 'Wargo, Jennifer A', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Jenq, Robert R', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Shelburne, Samuel A']","['Galloway-Pena JR', 'Shi Y', 'Peterson CB', 'Sahasrabhojane P', 'Gopalakrishnan V', 'Brumlow CE', 'Daver NG', 'Alfayez M', 'Boddu PC', 'Khan MAW', 'Wargo JA', 'Do KA', 'Jenq RR', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Shelburne SA']",,"['Department of Genomic Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['K01 AI143881/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA219896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,PMC7312220,['NOTNLM'],"['*Shannon diversity', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*carbapenem', '*induction chemotherapy', '*microbiome']",2019/08/23 06:00,2021/03/13 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['5553100 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciz777 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Jun 24;71(1):63-71. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz777.,20210312,63-71,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Viral vector-based suicide gene therapy is an attractive option, if these vectors can target the AML cells with high specificity and efficiency. In this study, we have developed a receptor-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV) based vector to target the CD33 antigen which is overexpressed in leukemic cells. A targeting peptide was rationally designed from the antigen-binding regions of a CD33 monoclonal antibody. This peptide was further expressed on the capsid of the AAV6 vector, since this serotype was most efficient among AAV1-rh10 vectors to infect the pro-monocytic, human myeloid leukemia cells (U937). AAV6-CD33 vectors expressing a suicide gene, the inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9), and its prodrug AP20187 significantly reduced ( approximately 59%) the viability of U937 cells. To further test its efficacy and specificity in vivo, AAV6-CD33 vectors were administered into a xenotransplantation model of AML in zebrafish through systemic delivery. We observed a significant antileukemic effect with AAV6-CD33 vectors, with a markedly higher survival (100% for AAV6-CD33 vectors vs 15% for mock-treated) and a higher number of TUNEL positive apoptotic cells after systemic vector delivery. Taken together, our work demonstrates the efficacy and translational potential of CD33-targeted AAV6 vectors for cytotoxic gene therapy in AML.","['Khan, Nusrat', 'Bammidi, Sridhar', 'Jayandharan, Giridhara R']","['Khan N', 'Bammidi S', 'Jayandharan GR']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9353-9053'],"['Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering , Indian Institute of Technology , Kanpur , 208016 , Uttar Pradesh , India.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering , Indian Institute of Technology , Kanpur , 208016 , Uttar Pradesh , India.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering , Indian Institute of Technology , Kanpur , 208016 , Uttar Pradesh , India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190904,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00511 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2019 Sep 18;30(9):2404-2416. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00511.

With a one-hour weekly dosing schedule, INO might be associated with lower healthcare system burden. This study analyses hospitalizations for INO vs SoC. METHODS: All patients receiving study treatment in the INO-VATE trial were included. The days hospitalized during study treatment was calculated. Due to different treatment durations for INO and SoC (median of 3 vs 1 cycles), number of hospital days was mainly reported per observed patient month. Hospital days per patient month were analyzed for different treatment cycles, subgroups, and main reasons for hospitalization. Differences between treatments were analyzed by the incidence rate ratio (IRR). RESULTS: Overall, 82.9% and 94.4% INO and SoC patients experienced at least one hospitalization. The mean hospitalization days per patient month was 7.6 and 18.4 days for INO and SoC (IRR = 0.413, P < .001), which corresponds to patients spending 25.0% and 60.5% of their treatment time in a hospital. Main hospitalization reasons were R/R ALL treatment (5.2 (INO) vs 14.0 (SoC) days, IRR = 0.368, P < .001), treatment toxicities (1.4 vs 2.8 days, IRR = 0.516, P < .001) or other reasons (1.0 vs 1.6 days, IRR 0.629, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin treatment in R/R ALL is associated with a lower hospitalization burden compared with SoC. It is likely this lower burden has a favorable impact on healthcare budgets and cost-effectiveness considerations.","['Marks, David I', 'van Oostrum, Ilse', 'Mueller, Sabrina', 'Welch, Verna', 'Vandendries, Erik', 'Loberiza, Fausto R', 'Bohme, Sarah', 'Su, Yun', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Marks DI', 'van Oostrum I', 'Mueller S', 'Welch V', 'Vandendries E', 'Loberiza FR', 'Bohme S', 'Su Y', 'Stelljes M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4944-5927', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307']","['Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK.', 'Ingress-Health Nederland B.V., Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Ingress-Health HWM GmbH, Wismar, Germany.', 'Pfizer Global HEOR, New York, NY, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Independent, Bridgewater, NJ, USA.', 'Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Pfizer/International'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190822,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6792500,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*hospitalization', '*inotuzumab ozogamicin']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2480 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Oct;8(13):5959-5968. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2480.

In this study, the WT1 and CCNA1 mRNA levels were found to be elevated in bone marrow samples from pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL or AMLM3) patients, and to be quite varied in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients, compared to nonleukemic bone marrow controls. Consistent with the observed upregulation of both WT1 and CCNA1 in APL, WT1 overexpression elevated the CCNA1 mRNA levels in K562 leukemia cells. Treatment with curcumin decreased the WT1 levels in K562 cells, and also decreased CCNA1 protein expression. The examination of the CCNA1 promoter identified potential canonical WT1 binding sites within the 3kb region upstream of the transcription start site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays confirmed WT1 binding and the activation of the CCNA1 promoter. Furthermore, the GCrich core CCNA1 promoter region provided additional noncanonical WT1 activation sites, as revealed by promoter assays. The importance of the GCrich core region of the CCNA1 promoter was confirmed by treating the K562 cells with mithramycin A, which blocks the binding of zinc finger transcription factors to GCrich sequences. Mithramycin A subsequently suppressed both CCNA1 promoter activity and protein expression in the K562 cells.

Bilateral X-ray amorphous CP coatings were prepared on the samples of commercially pure titanium in the anodal regime using a micro-arc method. An aqueous solution prepared from 20 wt% phosphoric acid, 6 wt% dissolved hydrohyapatite nanopowder (particle diameter 10-30 nm with single agglomerates up to 100 nm), and 9 wt% dissolved calcium carbonate was used to obtain CP coating. hAMMSCs isolated from lipoaspirate were co-cultured after 4 passages with the CP-coated samples at final concentration of 1.5 105 viable karyocytes per 1.5 mL of standard nutrition medium (without osteogenic stimulators) for 14 days (a determination of [CD45,34,14,20], CD73, CD90 small i, Cyrillic CD105 cell immunophenotype; an analysis of secretory activity) and 21 days (alizarin red S staining of culture) with medium replacement every 3-4 days.

Overexpression or rearrangements of this gene can result in various tumours. This study aimed to identify possible deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) of CCND1 using computational methods. Methods: SNPs in the human CCND1 gene were retrieved from dbSNP. These SNPs were screened by the Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) algorithm and the PredictSNP classification. Mutants with deleterious SNPs were built using Discovery Studio 3.5, and dynamics studies were performed on native and mutant varieties. Results: In Homo sapiens, 1194 SNPs were found, of which 94 were missense and 2 were nonsense SNPs. Three SNPs were found to be deleterious. Molecular dynamics and trajectory analysis showed that there was a significant deviation of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values in the N216K mutant from the values of the native protein. Conclusion: Based on this study, we propose that the SNP with SNP ID rs112525097 (NM_053056.2:c.648C>G) might cause aberrations in CCND1, which might lead to a change in the function of the G1/S-specific cyclin protein.

AMBRA1 is a mitophagy receptor for the selective removal of damaged mitochondria in mammalian cells. A critical unresolved issue is how AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy is controlled in response to cellular stress. Here, we investigated the role of BCL2-family proteins on AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy and showed that MCL1 delays AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy. Indeed, MCL1 overexpression is sufficient to inhibit recruitment to mitochondria of the E3 Ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, a crucial dynamic partner of AMBRA1, upon AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy induction. In addition, we found that during mitophagy induced by AMBRA1, MCL1 levels decreased but were sustained by inhibition of the GSK-3beta kinase, which delayed AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Also, we showed that MCL1 was phosphorylated by GSK-3beta at a conserved GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S159) during AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy and that this event was accompanied by HUWE1-dependent MCL1 degradation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that MCL1 stability is regulated by the kinase GSK-3beta and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 in regulating AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Our work thus defines MCL1 as an upstream stress-sensitive protein, functional in AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy.","['Strappazzon, Flavie', 'Di Rita, Anthea', 'Peschiaroli, Angelo', 'Leoncini, Pier Paolo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Melino, Gerry', 'Cecconi, Francesco']","['Strappazzon F', 'Di Rita A', 'Peschiaroli A', 'Leoncini PP', 'Locatelli F', 'Melino G', 'Cecconi F']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0285-7449', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5614-4359']","['IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia, 00143, Rome, Italy. f.strappazzon@hsantalucia.it.', 'IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia, 00143, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'National Research Council of Italy (CNR) Institute of Translational Pharmacology IFT Via Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncohematology and Cell and Gene therapy, IRCCS Ospedale pediatrico Bambino Gesu, 00143, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncohematology and Cell and Gene therapy, IRCCS Ospedale pediatrico Bambino Gesu, 00143, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Gynecology/Obstetrics and Pediatrics, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, TOR, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy. cecconi@cancer.dk.', 'Unit of Cell Stress and Survival, Center for Autophagy, Recycling and Disease (CARD), Danish Cancer Society Research Center, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. cecconi@cancer.dk.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy. cecconi@cancer.dk.""]",['eng'],"['MC_U132670600/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_00025/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190821,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC7206129,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2021/06/30 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-019-0404-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-019-0404-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Apr;27(4):1155-1168. doi: 10.1038/s41418-019-0404-8.

Loss and gain of GATA2 expression has been implicated in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) yet the precise biological impact of GATA2 expression on human AML cell fate decisions remains ambiguous. Herein, we performed large-scale bioinformatics that demonstrated relatively frequent GATA2 overexpression in AML patients as well as select human AML (or AML-like) cell lines. By using shRNAi to target GATA2 in these AML cell lines, and an AML cell line expressing normal levels of GATA2, we found that inhibition of GATA2 caused attenuated cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis exclusively in AML cell lines that overexpress GATA2. We proceeded to pharmacologically inhibit GATA2 in concert with AML chemotherapeutics and found this augmented cell killing in AML cell lines that overexpress GATA2, but not in an AML cell line expressing normal levels of GATA2. These data indicate that inhibition of GATA2 enhances chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis in human AML cells overexpressing GATA2. Thus, we define novel insights into the oncogenic role of GATA2 in human AML cells and suggest the potential utilization of transient GATA2 therapeutic targeting in AML.","['Menendez-Gonzalez, Juan Bautista', 'Sinnadurai, Samantha', 'Gibbs, Alex', 'Thomas, Leigh-Anne', 'Konstantinou, Maria', 'Garcia-Valverde, Alfonso', 'Boyer, Magali', 'Wang, Zhengke', 'Boyd, Ashleigh S', 'Blair, Allison', 'Morgan, Rhys G', 'Rodrigues, Neil P']","['Menendez-Gonzalez JB', 'Sinnadurai S', 'Gibbs A', 'Thomas LA', 'Konstantinou M', 'Garcia-Valverde A', 'Boyer M', 'Wang Z', 'Boyd AS', 'Blair A', 'Morgan RG', 'Rodrigues NP']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0161-4042', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0429-6294']","['European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.', 'Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI 029208, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Hospital, London, NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital, London, NW3 2QG, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHS Blood and Transplant, Filton, Bristol, BS34 7QH, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD, United Kingdom.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9QG, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, United Kingdom.

FLT3-ITD mutations enhance cell migration toward CXCL12, providing a drug resistance mechanism underlying the poor effects of FLT3-ITD antagonists. However, the mechanism by which FLT3-ITD mutations regulate the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis remains unclear. We analyzed the relationship between CXCR4 expression and the FLT3-ITD mutation in 466 patients with de novo AML to clarify the effect of FLT3-ITD mutations on CXCR4 expression in patients with AML. Our results indicated a positive correlation between the FLT3-ITD mutant-type allelic ratio (FLT3-ITD MR) and the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of CXCR4 expression in patients with AML (r = 0.588, P </= 0.0001). Moreover, the levels of phospho(p)-STAT5, Pim-1 and CXCR4 proteins were positively correlated with the FLT3-ITD MR, and the mRNA levels of CXCR4 and Pim-1 which has been revealed as one of the first known target genes of STAT5, were upregulated with an increasing FLT3-ITD MR(P < 0.05). Therefore, FLT3-ITD mutations upregulate the expression of CXCR4 in patients with AML, and the downstream signaling intermediates STAT5 and Pim-1 are also involved in this phenomenon and subsequently contribute to chemotherapy resistance and disease relapse in patients with AML. However, the mechanism must be confirmed in further experiments. The combination of CXCR4 antagonists and FLT3 inhibitors may improve the sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapy and overcome drug resistance.","['Cao, Tingyong', 'Jiang, Nenggang', 'Liao, Hongyan', 'Shuai, Xiao', 'Su, Jun', 'Zheng, Qin']","['Cao T', 'Jiang N', 'Liao H', 'Shuai X', 'Su J', 'Zheng Q']",,"['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China. zhengqinhx@scu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190821,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6704161,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-48687-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-48687-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 21;9(1):12209. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-48687-z.,20201020,12209,,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, CXCR4/biosynthesis/genetics', '*STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This elicits histone H3R2me1/H3R2me2s-induced transcriptional activation by the recruitment of the WDR5/MLL methyltransferase complexes and concomitant H3K4 methylation at the promoters of multiple genes in GSH-metabolic cascade. Treatment with OICR-9429, a small-molecule antagonist of the WDR5-MLL interaction, inhibits the beta-catenin/JDP2/PRMT5 complex-reestablished GSH metabolism, leading to a lethal increase in the already-elevated levels of ROS in the genotoxic-agent treated cancer cells.

Cell proliferation after exposure of K562 cells or Multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1)-transfected K562 cells was determined by a cell counting kit-8 assay. The intracellular accumulation amount of the drug showing a sustained cytostatic effect was measured by ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Cell viability decreased in a culture time-dependent manner after washing out nilotinib and dasatinib. The sustained cytostatic effect of dasatinib, but not that of nilotinib, correlated with the intracellular accumulation level. In contrast, imatinib showed continuous a cytostatic effect after drug washout for long-term exposure but not after drug washout for short-term exposure. These results suggest that a good response in patients with a low serum concentration of imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib may be due to the cytostatic effect of that drug continues even after its disappearance in plasma.","['Aoyama, Tsuyoshi', 'Shibayama, Yoshihiko', 'Furukawa, Tatsuhiko', 'Sugawara, Mitsuru', 'Takekuma, Yoh']","['Aoyama T', 'Shibayama Y', 'Furukawa T', 'Sugawara M', 'Takekuma Y']",,"['Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Drug Fomulation, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Graduate School Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190820,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,,['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'cytostatic effect', 'multidrug resistance protein-1', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/08/23 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.b19-00185 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2019 Nov 1;42(11):1805-1813. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b19-00185.

The reason for FrMLV sensitivity of B-1 cells and their impact on viral spread is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) sensing and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in B-1 cells contribute to FrMLV susceptibility. FrMLV infection in B-1 cell-deficient mice (bumble; IkappaBNS dysfunctional) was significantly lower than that in the wild-type mice and was rescued by adoptive transfer of wild-type B-1 cells. This rescue of FrMLV infection in bumble mice was dependent on intact TLR7 sensing and IFN-I signaling within B-1 cells. Analyses of infected cell types revealed that the reduced infection in bumble mice was due predominantly to compromised virus spread to the B-2 cell population. Our data reveal how FrMLV exploits innate immune sensing and activation in the B-1 cell population for infection and subsequent spread to other lymphocytes.IMPORTANCE Viruses establish infection in hosts by targeting highly permissive cell types. The retrovirus Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV) infects a subtype of B cells called B-1 cells that permit robust virus replication. The reason for their susceptibility had remained unknown. We found that innate sensing of incoming virus and the ensuing type I interferon response within B-1 cells are responsible for their observed susceptibility. Our data provide insights into how retroviruses coevolved with the host to co-opt innate immune sensing pathways designed to fight virus infections for establishing infection.

Utilizing conditional Kdm4a/Kdm4b/Kdm4c triple-knockout mice, we show that KDM4 activity is required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance in vivo. The knockout of the KDM4 demethylases leads to accumulation of H3K9me3 on transcription start sites and the corresponding downregulation of expression of several genes in HSCs. We show that 2 of these genes, Taf1b and Nom1, are essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic cells.

DNA methylation profiling can subdivide early-stage patients into naive B-cell-like CLL (n-CLL), memory B-cell-like CLL (m-CLL), and intermediate CLL (i-CLL), with differing times to first treatment and overall survival. However, whether DNA methylation can identify patients destined to respond favorably to CIT has not been ascertained. We classified treatment-naive patients (n = 605) from 3 UK chemo and CIT clinical trials into the 3 epigenetic subgroups, using pyrosequencing and microarray analysis, and performed expansive survival analysis. The n-CLL, i-CLL, and m-CLL signatures were found in 80% (n = 245/305), 17% (53/305), and 2% (7/305) of IGHV-unmutated (IGHV-U) cases, respectively, and in 9%, (19/216), 50% (108/216), and 41% (89/216) of IGHV-M cases, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional analysis identified m-CLL as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.87; P = .018) in CLL4, and for progression-free survival (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .002) in ARCTIC and ADMIRE patients. The analysis of epigenetic subgroups in patients entered into 3 first-line UK CLL trials identifies m-CLL as an independent marker of prolonged survival and may aid in the identification of patients destined to demonstrate prolonged survival after CIT.","['Wojdacz, Tomasz K', 'Amarasinghe, Harindra E', 'Kadalayil, Latha', 'Beattie, Alice', 'Forster, Jade', 'Blakemore, Stuart J', 'Parker, Helen', 'Bryant, Dean', 'Larrayoz, Marta', 'Clifford, Ruth', 'Robbe, Pauline', 'Davis, Zadie A', 'Else, Monica', 'Howard, Dena R', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Collins, Andrew', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Oscier, David G', 'Rose-Zerilli, Matthew J J', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Strefford, Jonathan C']","['Wojdacz TK', 'Amarasinghe HE', 'Kadalayil L', 'Beattie A', 'Forster J', 'Blakemore SJ', 'Parker H', 'Bryant D', 'Larrayoz M', 'Clifford R', 'Robbe P', 'Davis ZA', 'Else M', 'Howard DR', 'Stamatopoulos B', 'Steele AJ', 'Rosenquist R', 'Collins A', 'Pettitt AR', 'Hillmen P', 'Plass C', 'Schuh A', 'Catovsky D', 'Oscier DG', 'Rose-Zerilli MJJ', 'Oakes CC', 'Strefford JC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1553-9565', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0691-1126', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3333-9783', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0667-1596', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3938-8490', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1064-5350', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0972-2881']","['Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Independent Clinical Epigenetics Laboratory, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Genetic Epidemiology and Bioinformatics, Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Centre of Excellence in Aging Research, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Oxford National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre/Molecular Diagnostic Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre/Molecular Diagnostic Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Cancer Genomics, Cancer Research UK Centre and Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Genetic Epidemiology and Bioinformatics, Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, The German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;

Patients who are relapsed or refractory can be treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation with modest benefits to event-free and overall survival. Other modalities of immunotherapy include antibody therapies, which hold considerable promise and can be categorized into unconjugated classical antibodies, multivalent recombinant antibodies (bi-, tri- and quad-specific), toxin-conjugated antibodies and radio-conjugated antibodies. While unconjugated antibodies can facilitate Natural Killer (NK) cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), bi- and tri-specific antibodies can engage either NK cells or T-cells to redirect cytotoxicity against AML targets in a highly efficient manner, similarly to classic ADCC. Finally, toxin-conjugated and radio-conjugated antibodies can increase the potency of antibody therapies. Several AML tumour-associated antigens are at the forefront of targeted therapy development, which include CD33, CD123, CD13, CLL-1 and CD38 and which may be present on both AML blasts and leukemic stem cells. This review focused on antibody therapies for AML, including pre-clinical studies of these agents and those that are either entering or have been tested in early phase clinical trials.

AML cells, especially in the acute promyelocytic leukemia subtype, may release microparticles (MPs), tissue factor (TF), and cancer procoagulant (CP) to promote coagulopathy. Hyperfibrinolysis is also triggered via release of annexin II, t-PA, u-PA, and u-PAR. Various inflammatory cytokines from cancer cells, such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, activate endothelial cells and promote leukostasis. This condition may increase the ICH risk and lead to poor clinical outcomes. Here, we present a case under a unique situation with acute ICH detected prior to the diagnosis of AML.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to correlate the expression level of SAMHD1 with other apoptotic and autophagic genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: In the present study, mRNA levels of SAMHD1 with other apoptotic and autophagic-related genes were evaluated in patients who were newly diagnosed with AML. RESULTS: SAMHD1, Bcl-xl, Bax, Bak, XIAP, and cIAP1 were downregulated in the AML group compared to the non-AML group (p < 0.05). SAMHD1 expression did not correlate with the other genes, while most apoptotic genes were positively correlated with each other. SAMHD1 expression was not associated with the blood routine or blast percentage of the AML patients, while Bax, Bak, cIAP2, and LC3 were significantly correlated with white blood cells. No statistically significant differences were found between the studied genes and prognosis stratifications, but Bcl-xl, Bak, cIAP1, and Mcl-1, LC3 were expressed at lower levels in the unfavorable AML group compared to the controls. CONCLUSION: SAMHD1 and Bcl-xl, Bax, Bak, XIAP, and cIAP1 were downregulated in AML patients, while there were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis with reference to SAMHD1 expression.","['Jiang, Huinan', 'Li, Chuan', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Shengjing Hospital']","['Jiang H', 'Li C', 'Liu Z', 'Shengjing Hospital']",,"['Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Department, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190821,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Apoptosis', '*SAMHD1 gene']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['000500822 [pii]', '10.1159/000500822 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2020;143(1):51-59. doi: 10.1159/000500822.

We also reviewed the literature of previously published cases. METHODS: We discuss the clinical features, histopathology, and outcomes for three patients with ALCL and CLL from Perth, Australia. The cases were also included in a literature review of existing cases and comparisons were made with our cohort. RESULTS: The three patients included two men (aged 77 and 74 years) and one woman (aged 66 years). All had a history of untreated CLL with diagnosis established 4 to 16 years before. They had lymphadenopathy and/or cutaneous/soft tissue lesions that proved to be ALCL, ALK+ (one case) or ALCL, ALK- (two cases). CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required in this area to establish prognostic and management recommendations. Increasing numbers of cases are being described. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography was not useful in our cohort for diagnosing progression.","['Van Der Nest, Bianca M', 'Leslie, Connull', 'Joske, David', 'Radeski, Dejan', 'White, Rohen', 'Cheah, Chan Yoon']","['Van Der Nest BM', 'Leslie C', 'Joske D', 'Radeski D', 'White R', 'Cheah CY']",,"['Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, Pathwest Laboratory Medicine, Perth, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia.', 'Pathwest Laboratory Medicine WA, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Crawley.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia.', 'Pathwest Laboratory Medicine WA, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Crawley.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia.', 'Pathwest Laboratory Medicine WA, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Crawley.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anaplastic large cell lymphoma', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Composite', '*Peripheral T-cell lymphoma', '*Transformation']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['5552737 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz109 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Nov 4;152(6):818-827. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz109.,20200330,818-827,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Herein, the authors reported clinical features and outcomes for those patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after treatment with blinatumomab. METHODS: In the TOWER study, adults with R/R ALL were randomized 2:1 to receive blinatumomab or SOC. Study treatment consisted of 2 cycles of induction with blinatumomab or SOC followed by consolidation and maintenance therapy. At any time after the first cycle, patients who were eligible for HSCT could proceed to HSCT. RESULTS: Of the 97 patients who underwent HSCT during the study, baseline characteristics generally were comparable and donor types were similar between the patients treated with blinatumomab (65 patients) and those receiving SOC (32 patients). There was no evidence to suggest that the survival benefit of HSCT differed between the patients treated with blinatumomab and those receiving SOC (P = .68). On the basis of descriptive statistics, a survival benefit of HSCT versus no HSCT was not observed in patients who achieved complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery with blinatumomab (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.54-2.53). The best outcomes were achieved in patients with no prior salvage therapy and with minimal residual disease response to blinatumomab regardless of on-study HSCT status. CONCLUSIONS: Survival was found to be driven by response to study treatment and by salvage status regardless of on-study HSCT status. These data should be interpreted with caution because the current study was not designed to prospectively assess survival outcomes associated with HSCT after blinatumomab. LAY SUMMARY: Evidence before this study: Blinatumomab is associated with superior morphologic and molecular response rates and superior overall outcome when compared with standard of care chemotherapy in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Added value of this study: The best outcomes with blinatumomab were observed in patients who achieved minimal residual disease remission in first salvage treatment regardless of subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Implications of all the available evidence: Patients achieving CR/CRh/CRi following blinatumomab can have a durable response with or without HSCT.","['Jabbour, Elias J', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Ghobadi, Armin', 'Topp, Max S', 'Tran, Qui', 'Franklin, Janet L', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Stein, Anthony S']","['Jabbour EJ', 'Gokbuget N', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Thomas X', 'Larson RA', 'Yoon SS', 'Ghobadi A', 'Topp MS', 'Tran Q', 'Franklin JL', 'Forman SJ', 'Stein AS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre-Benite, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Haematology, Wurzburg University, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.', 'Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],['N/A/Amgen Inc'],['Journal Article'],20190821,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blinatumomab', 'refractory', 'relapsed', 'transplantation']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32335 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Dec 1;125(23):4181-4192. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32335.

An anti-JL1 antibody combined with a toxic substance can have targeted therapeutic effects against JL1-positive leukemia; however, JL1 expression on bone marrow (BM) lymphoma cells has not been assessed using flow cytometry. We investigated JL1 expression on BM lymphoma cells from patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to assess the potential of JL1 as a therapeutic target. METHODS: Patients with BM involvement of mature B-cell (N=44) or T- and natural killer (NK)-cell (N=4) lymphomas were enrolled from May 2015 to September 2016. JL1 expression on BM lymphoma cells was investigated using flow cytometry. Clinical, pathological, and cytogenetic characteristics, and treatment responses were compared according to JL1 expression status. RESULTS: Of the patients with NHL and BM involvement, 37.5% (18/48) were JL1-positive. Among mature B-cell lymphomas, 100%, 38.9%, 33.3%, 100%, and 25.0% of Burkitt lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell leukemias, mantle cell leukemias, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and other B-cell lymphomas, respectively, were JL1-positive. Three mature T- and NK-cell NHLs were JL1-positive. JL1 expression was associated with age (P=0.045), complete response (P=0.004), and BM involvement at follow-up (P=0.017), but not with sex, performance status, the B symptoms, packed marrow pattern, cytogenetic abnormalities, or survival. CONCLUSIONS: JL1 positivity was associated with superior complete response and less BM involvement in NHL following chemotherapy.","['Kim, Min Sun', 'Park, Chan Jeoung', 'Cho, Young Uk', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Seo, Eul Ju', 'Park, Chan Sik', 'Huh, Jooryung', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Seo, Jong Jin', 'Yoon, Dok Hyun', 'Suh, Cheolwon']","['Kim MS', 'Park CJ', 'Cho YU', 'Jang S', 'Seo EJ', 'Park CS', 'Huh J', 'Im HJ', 'Seo JJ', 'Yoon DH', 'Suh C']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2061-5726', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4396-8348', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4403-8989', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0045-1747', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8247-3746', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9783-4498', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2148-5778', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8799-4068', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0191-7836', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8289-3548', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9178-4431']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. cjpark@amc.seoul.kr.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center and University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,PMC6713657,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'JL1 expression', 'Mature B-cell lymphoma', 'T- and natural killer-cell lymphoma']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['40.1 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2020.40.1.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2020 Jan;40(1):1-6. doi: 10.3343/alm.2020.40.1.1.,20200226,1-6,['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (JL1 antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, its efficacy against non-hematological malignancies has been limited as a result of several biological problems characteristic of the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. One of the main hurdles is the heterogeneous nature of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) expressed in solid tumors. Another hurdle is the inefficient activation and limited persistence of CAR-T cells, mainly as a result of T-cell exhaustion caused by immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. In the present study, to address these problems, we engineered CAR-T cells to produce antagonistic anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) single-chain variable fragment (scFv), by which PD-1-dependent inhibitory signals in CAR-T cells and adjacent tumor-specific non-CAR-T cells are attenuated. In mouse solid tumor models, PD-1 scFv-producing CAR-T cells induced potent therapeutic effects superior to those of conventional CAR-T cells, along with a significant reduction of apoptotic cell death not only in CAR-T cells themselves but also in TAA-specific T cells in the tumor tissue. In addition, the treatment with anti-PD-1 scFv-producing CAR-T cells resulted in an increased concentration of PD-1 scFv in tumor tissue but not in sera, suggesting an induction of less severe systemic immune-related adverse events. Hence, the present study developed anti-PD-1 scFv-producing CAR-T cell technology and explored its cellular mechanisms underlying potent antitumor efficacy.","['Nakajima, Masao', 'Sakoda, Yukimi', 'Adachi, Keishi', 'Nagano, Hiroaki', 'Tamada, Koji']","['Nakajima M', 'Sakoda Y', 'Adachi K', 'Nagano H', 'Tamada K']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3098-2565'],"['Department of Immunology, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological, Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological, Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.']",['eng'],['P-CREATE 16770206/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development'],['Journal Article'],20190917,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC6778656,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T cell', 'PD-1', 'activation-induced cell death', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-specific T cell']",2019/08/23 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14169 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Oct;110(10):3079-3088. doi: 10.1111/cas.14169.

Characterisation of the transcriptional network that regulates blood cell emergence has led to the identification of transcription factors essential for this process. Among the many factors wired within this complex regulatory network, ETV2, SCL and RUNX1 are the central components. All three factors are absolutely required for blood cell generation, each one controlling a precise step of specification from the mesoderm germ layer to fully functional blood progenitors. Insight into the transcriptional control of blood cell emergence has been used for devising protocols to generate blood cells de novo, either through reprogramming of somatic cells or through forward programming of pluripotent stem cells. Interestingly, the physiological process of blood cell generation and its laboratory-engineered counterpart have very little in common.","['Menegatti, Sara', 'de Kruijf, Marcel', 'Garcia-Alegria, Eva', 'Lacaud, Georges', 'Kouskoff, Valerie']","['Menegatti S', 'de Kruijf M', 'Garcia-Alegria E', 'Lacaud G', 'Kouskoff V']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9801-4993'],"['Developmental Haematopoiesis Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, the University of Manchester, UK.', 'Developmental Haematopoiesis Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, the University of Manchester, UK.', 'Developmental Haematopoiesis Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, the University of Manchester, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Stem Cell Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Macclesfield, UK.', 'Developmental Haematopoiesis Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, the University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['MR/P000673/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/I001794/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/R007209/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', '12037/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', ""GA6586250/European Union's Horizon 2020/International"", 'C5759/A20971/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190831,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,PMC6916194,['NOTNLM'],"['*embryonic haematopoiesis', '*haemogenic endothelium', '*transcription network']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/06/20 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1873-3468.13585 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2019 Dec;593(23):3304-3315. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.13585.

To investigate the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD, 676 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we retrospectively analyzed cases and conducted a review of the literature. Of the 676 de novo AML cases, 34 (5.0%) were FLT3-TKD-positive; both FLT3-TKD and FLT3-ITD were noted in only two cases (0.3%). Although no significant differences in relapse-free survival (RFS) were noted, FLT3-TKD-positive cases showed better prognoses than FLT3-ITD-positive cases (FLT3-TKD versus FLT3-ITD, p = 0.152). For overall survival (OS), although FLT3-TKD-positive cases showed prognoses similar to those for FLT3-WT cases, their prognoses were significantly better than those of FLT3-ITD-positive cases (FLT3-TKD versus FLT3-ITD, p = 0.032). Moreover, the 5-year OS for FLT3-TKD-positive cases was 46.1%, indicating that this as an intermediate prognosis group. Although no reports from Asia have indicated a frequency of FLT3-TKD-positive cases > 10%, several reports from Europe and the United States have indicated frequencies > 10%. This suggests the possibility that FLT3-TKD-positive cases are less common in Asia than in Europe and the United States. We anticipate that in the future, the appearance of targeting agents, such as FLT3 inhibitors, will improve the prognosis of FLT3-TKD-positive AML relative to that of FLT3-WT AML.","['Sakaguchi,

Currently, it is considered that the extensively expressed of Mcl-1 protein in melanoma cells is associated with rapid tumor progression, poor prognosis and low chemosensitivity. Therefore, the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 could be considered as a potential target for malignant melanoma treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of MIM1 a specific low molecular Mcl-1 protein inhibitor and mixture of MIM1 and dacarbazine on the viability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction in amelanotic C32 melanoma cells. The cytotoxic activity of MIM1 towards C32 melanoma cells was examined by the WST-1 test. The Mcl-1 protein level as a drug target in amelanotic melanoma cells was defined by Western blot analysis. Cell cycle progression, DNA fragmentation as well as GSH depletion were determined by fluorescence image cytometer NucleoCounter NC-3000. The obtained results demonstrate that the specific Mcl-1 protein inhibitor - MIM1 decreases cell viability and induce apoptosis (S-phase arrest, DNA fragmentation and redox imbalance) in amelanotic melanoma cells and intensify the proapoptotic properties of DTIC, as a result of interactions with Mcl-1 protein. Taken together, the presented data suggest that Mcl-1 protein is a an important target in malignant melanoma treatment and provide for the first time convincing evidence that MIM1, which inhibits Mcl-1 antiapoptotic protein is able to induce apoptosis and sensitize melanoma cells to alkylating agent.","['Respondek, Michalina', 'Beberok, Artur', 'Rzepka, Zuzanna', 'Rok, Jakub', 'Wrzesniok, Dorota']","['Respondek M', 'Beberok A', 'Rzepka Z', 'Rok J', 'Wrzesniok D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0844-9155'],"['School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200, Sosnowiec, Poland. mrespondek@sum.edu.pl.', 'School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.']",['eng'],"['KNW-1-085/N/8/O/Medical University of Silesia', 'KNW-2-031/D/8/N/Medical University of Silesia']",['Journal Article'],20190820,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,PMC7297871,['NOTNLM'],"['Amelanotic melanoma', 'Apoptosis', 'BH3 mimetics', 'Dacarbazine, image cytometry', 'MIM1']",2019/08/23 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-019-00715-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-019-00715-z [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2020 Jul;26(3):1465-1474. doi: 10.1007/s12253-019-00715-z.

The development of new and effective therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis is necessary. A number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to serve a crucial role in atherosclerosis. However, the role of miRNA (miR)217 in atherosclerosis remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role and mechanism of miR217 in atherosclerosis. The level of miR217 was detected in the blood of patients with atherosclerosis using reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR. THP1 acute monocytic leukemia cells were treated with oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein (oxLDL) to develop an atherosclerotic cell model of macrophages. The relationship between miR217 and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was determined by TargetScan and dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Production of proinflammatory factors and triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were also determined. The results demonstrated that miR217 was significantly upregulated in atherosclerosis. SIRT1 was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR217 and was downregulated in atherosclerosis. Downregulation of miR217 significantly inhibited oxLDLinduced TG and TC level increase, cell apoptosis and the upregulation of the proinflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)6 and IL1beta. Additionally, the SIRT1/AMPactivated protein kinase alpha/NFkappaB pathway was at least partially involved in modulating the effects of miR217 inhibition on THP1 cells treated with oxLDL. In addition, the effects of miR217 downregulation on oxLDLtreated THP1 cells were eliminated by SIRT1 silencing. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that miR217 downregulation may relieve atherosclerosis through the inhibition of macrophage apoptosis and inflammatory response by targeting SIRT1.","['Zhang, Liyun', 'Chen, Juan', 'He, Qin', 'Chao, Ze', 'Li, Xuyong', 'Chen, Manhua']","['Zhang L', 'Chen J', 'He Q', 'Chao Z', 'Li X', 'Chen M']",,"['Department of Cardiology, Wuhan Central Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430015, P.R.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the underlying mechanisms by which HHT enhanced imatinib sensitivity. K562 CML cells were treated with HHT and imatinib separately or in combination. Cell viability was detected by Cell Counting Kit8 assay; apoptotic rates and protein expression levels of phosphorylatedtyrosine (pTyr) and pCRK like protooncogene, adaptor protein (pCrkl) were analyzed by flow cytometry; zincfinger protein, Xlinked (ZFX) overexpression plasmid was transfected to cells using electroporation; western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of PI3K, AKT, pAKT and ZFX; and reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR was used to measure ZFX mRNA expression levels. The results demonstrated that HHT and imatinib cotreatment had significant effects of proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction on K562 CML cells compared with imatinib alone. Cotreatment also significantly downregulated the expression levels of pTyr, pCrkl, PI3K and pAkt compared with imatinib or HHT treatment. In addition, HHT downregulated ZFX mRNA and protein expression. ZFX overexpression reversed cell sensitivity to imatinib and HHT and also reduced the HHTinduced imatinib sensitization by increasing pAkt expression. In conclusion, HHT may enhance the effect of imatinib on CML cells by downregulating ZFX.","['Wu, Jingjing', 'Wei, Bin', 'Shi, Yuye', 'Lu, Xueying', 'Ding, Yihan', 'Wang, Chunling', 'Li, Yufeng']","['Wu J', 'Wei B', 'Shi Y', 'Lu X', 'Ding Y', 'Wang C', 'Li Y']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huai'an No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, Jiangsu 223300, P.R.

Epigenetic modifications include changes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA associated gene silencing. Transcriptional regulation, chromosome stability, DNA replication and DNA repair are all controlled by these modifications. Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers are a frequent occurrence in hematologic malignancies and important in both the initiation and progression of cancer. Epigenetic modifications are also frequently reversible, allowing excellent opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The goal of epigenetic therapies is to reverse epigenetic dysregulation, restore the epigenetic balance, and revert malignant cells to a more normal condition. The role of epigenetic therapies thus far is most established in hematologic malignancies, with several agents already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In this review, we discuss pharmacological agents targeting epigenetic regulators.","['Chandhok, Namrata S', 'Prebet, Thomas']","['Chandhok NS', 'Prebet T']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6872-625X'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Smilow Cancer Center at Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Smilow Cancer Center at Yale New Haven Hospital, 35 Park Street, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190806,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC6685116,['NOTNLM'],"['BET inhibitors', 'DOT1L inhibitors', 'IDH inhibitors', 'LSD1 inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'demethylases', 'epigenetic modifications', 'histone modification', 'hypomethylating agents', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'novel agents']",2019/08/23 06:00,2019/08/23 06:01,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719866081 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719866081 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Aug 6;10:2040620719866081. doi: 10.1177/2040620719866081. eCollection 2019.,,2040620719866081,,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Hodgkin-Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cell-derived single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, translocations and VH-DH-JH rearrangements were detected in pretherapy ccfDNA of 72 of 96 patients. Number of variants per patient ranged from 1 to 21 with allele frequencies from 0.6 to 42%. Nine translocation breakpoints were detected. Genes involved in JAK/STAT, NFkB and PI3K signaling and antigen presentation were most frequently affected. SOCS1 variants, mainly deletions, were found in most circulating tumor (ct) DNAs, and seven of the nine translocation breakpoints involved SOCS1. Analysis of VH-DH-JH rearrangements revealed an origin of PHL HRS cells from partially selected germinal center B cells. Amounts of pretherapy ctDNA were correlated with metabolic tumor volumes. Furthermore, in all ccfDNA samples of 43 patients with early response assessment quantitative qPET < 3, indicative of a favorable clinical course, ctDNA was not detectable. In contrast, in five of six patients with qPET > 3, indicative of an unfavorable clinical course, ctDNA remained detectable. ccfDNA analysis of PHL is thus a suitable approach to determine pathogenic mechanisms and monitor therapy response.","['Desch, Ann-Kathrin', 'Hartung, Kristin', 'Botzen, Ante', 'Brobeil, Alexander', 'Rummel, Mathias', 'Kurch, Lars', 'Georgi, Thomas', 'Jox, Theresa',

MAIT cells acquire effector functions during thymic development, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the developmental path of 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes. In addition to the known MAIT1 and MAIT17 effector subsets selected on bone-marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, we identified 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes that were selected on thymic epithelial cells and differentiated into CD44(-) naive T cells. MAIT cell positive selection required signaling through the adapter, SAP, that controlled the expression of the transcription factor, ZBTB16. Pseudotemporal ordering of single cells revealed transcriptional trajectories of 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes selected on either thymic epithelial cells or hematopoietic cells. The resulting model illustrates T cell lineage decisions.","['Legoux, Francois', 'Gilet, Jules', 'Procopio, Emanuele', 'Echasserieau, Klara', 'Bernardeau, Karine', 'Lantz, Olivier']","['Legoux F', 'Gilet J', 'Procopio E', 'Echasserieau K', 'Bernardeau K', 'Lantz O']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-7637', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3161-7719']","['INSERM U932, PSL University, Institut Curie, Paris, France. francois.legoux@curie.fr.', 'INSERM U932, PSL University, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U932, PSL University, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Production de Proteines Recombinantes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM-1232, Nantes, France.', 'Production de Proteines Recombinantes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM-1232, Nantes, France.', 'INSERM U932, PSL University, Institut Curie, Paris, France. olivier.lantz@curie.fr.', ""Laboratoire d'immunologie Clinique, Institut Curie, Paris, France. olivier.lantz@curie.fr."", ""Centre d'investigation Clinique en Biotherapie, Gustave-Roussy Institut Curie, Paris, France. olivier.lantz@curie.fr.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190820,United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41590-019-0465-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41590-019-0465-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Immunol. 2019 Sep;20(9):1244-1255. doi: 10.1038/s41590-019-0465-3.

Using a T-cell depletion approach, these patients can benefit from a graft-vs-leukemia effect in the absence of both acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease.

The major cause of death after second HSCT is leukemic relapse. One reliable predictor for survival after 2nd-HSCT are posttransplant MRD levels. Patients with detectable or increase of MRD are likely to relapse. Patients in complete molecular remission show the best leukemia-free survival and lowest cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse. As patients who undergo second or subsequent HSCT are high-risk patients, we evaluated the prophylactic use of the chimeric Fc-optimized CD19-4G7SDIE-mAb. Posttransplant relapsed CD19(+) BCP-ALL patients, who underwent a second or subsequent haplo-HSCT from a T- and B-cell depleted graft received posttransplant prophylactic CD19-4G7SDIE-mAb treatment on compassionate use in complete molecular remission, to increase the antileukemic activity of the new reconstituting immune system by recruiting Fc-expressing effector cells. NK cells recovered early and robust. The 3 year overall survival in 15 evaluable patients was 56%, the 3 year event-free survival was 55% and the CI of relapse 38%. Compared to a historical control group, the CI of relapse was markedly lower and consecutively the EFS higher.

Strategies to fasten T-cell reconstitution in this setting are highly warranted as opportunistic infections and an increased risk of relapse account for high rates of morbidity and mortality especially during early month following this type of HSCT. We have implemented a feeder free cell system based on the use of the notch ligand DL4 and cytokines allowing for the in vitro differentiation of human T-Lymphoid Progenitor cells (HTLPs) from various sources of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and precursor cells (HSPCs). Co- transplantion of human T-lymphoid progenitors (HTLPs) and non- manipulated HSPCs into immunodeficient mice successfully accelerated the reconstitution of a polyclonal T-cell repertoire. This review summarizes preclinical data on the use of T-cell progenitors for treatment of post- transplantation immunodeficiency and gives insights into the development of GMP based protocols for potential clinical applications including gene therapy approaches. Future clinical trials implementing this protocol will aim at the acceleration of immune reconstitution in different clinical settings such as SCID and leukemia patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation. Apart from pure cell-therapy approaches, the combination of DL-4 culture with gene transduction protocols will open new perspectives in terms of gene therapy applications for primary immunodeficiencies.","['Andre, Isabelle', 'Simons, Laura', 'Ma, Kuiying', 'Moirangthem, Ranjita Devi', 'Diana, Jean-Sebastien', 'Magrin, Elisa', 'Couzin, Chloe', 'Magnani, Alessandra', 'Cavazzana, Marina']","['Andre I', 'Simons L', 'Ma K', 'Moirangthem RD', 'Diana JS', 'Magrin E', 'Couzin C', 'Magnani A', 'Cavazzana M']",,"['Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France. isabelle.andre@inserm.fr.', 'Laboratory of Human Lymphohematopoiesis, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine Institute, Paris, France. isabelle.andre@inserm.fr.', 'Paris Descartes University - Sorbonne Paris Cite, Imagine Institute, Paris, France. isabelle.andre@inserm.fr.', 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', ""Department of Biotherapy, Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Human Lymphohematopoiesis, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes University - Sorbonne Paris Cite, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Human Lymphohematopoiesis, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes University - Sorbonne Paris Cite, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', ""Department of Biotherapy, Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', ""Department of Biotherapy, Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', ""Department of Biotherapy, Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', ""Department of Biotherapy, Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Biotherapy Clinical Investigation Center, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Ouest, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM CIC 1416, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Human Lymphohematopoiesis, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes University - Sorbonne Paris Cite, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', ""Department of Biotherapy, Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0599-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0599-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Aug;54(Suppl 2):749-755. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0599-9.,20200908,749-755,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution/*immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few inroads have been made into the problem of leukemia relapse which is the primary reason for failure of allo-HCT. The graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) response, in which engrafted immunocompetent donor immune cells can eliminate leukemia cells, is acknowledged as the foundation upon which the curative potential of allo-HCT is based. Despite our strongly held faith in its existence, we remain unable to define GVL on a mechanistic level. T cells, in part, mediate GVL though the roles of specific T cell subsets, NK cells, B cells, macrophages remain elusive. A higher frequency of marrow-infiltrating T cells expressing PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3 and other immune checkpoints have been observed in relapsed patients compared to those in remission. Studies have described the association of T cells expressing an exhausted phenotype with response to immune manipulation post-HCT. In light of these observations and the well documented activity of immune checkpoint blockade (CPB) in transplant naive patients with hematologic malignancies, considerable interest has developed in evaluating strategies incorporating CPB to address relapse post-HCT. While checkpoint inhibitors may be provocative agents to test, they also raise concern for potential induction of GVHD and uncontrollable immune breakthrough events. This review will lay the framework upon which CPB is being utilized post-HCT, describe early clinical results, and lay out future directions.","['Soiffer, Robert J']",['Soiffer RJ'],,"['Dana Farbcer Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. robert_soiffer@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0617-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0617-y [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Aug;54(Suppl 2):798-802. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0617-y.,20200908,798-802,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that in the last years we have made major progress in controlling infections, acute and chronic GvHD and making stem cell transplantation available to elderly patients. However, little improvement has been made to achieve better tumor control and to lower the relapse rate. Thus, novel immunotherapeutic strategies are increasingly used prior to or even following allogeneic stem cell transplantation to better control the underlying malignancy and thus, to reduce the relapse rate. These novel immunotherapeutic strategies comprise monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins and even more effective T cell redirecting strategies like bispecific antibodies and T cells transduced with either chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) or (affinity-tuned) T cell receptors (TCR).","['Einsele, Hermann', 'Rasche, Leo', 'Topp, Max S', 'Martin Kortum, K', 'Duell, Johannes']","['Einsele H', 'Rasche L', 'Topp MS', 'Martin Kortum K', 'Duell J']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.

The first successful protocol of haploidentical transplantation was based on a highly myeloablative and immunosuppressive conditioning regimen and the infusion of a ""mega-dose"" of T-cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cells. More than 90% of patients engrafted and <10% developed GVHD. The protocol did not include post-transplant immunosuppression, which favored the graft-versus-tumor effect mediated by alloreactive NK cells and residual alloreactive T cells. However, donor post-transplant immune reconstitution was slow with a high risk of infection-related mortality. More recently, T-cell-depleted haploidentical transplantation has become the platform for innovative cell therapies that aim to enhance T-cell immunity while preventing adverse reactions against host tissues. One strategy is adoptive immunotherapy with conventional T cells and regulatory T cells. Preclinical studies and clinical trials have proven that regulatory T cells control GVHD caused by co-infused conventional T cells while the graft-versus-tumor effect is retained. The use of regulatory T cells in the absence of any other form of immune suppression allowed for a conventional T cell-mediated full eradication of disease in the vast majority of high-risk acute leukemia patients.","['Pierini, Antonio', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Mancusi, Antonella', 'Carotti, Alessandra', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Terenzi, Adelmo', 'Martelli, Massimo Fabrizio', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Pierini A', 'Ruggeri L', 'Mancusi A', 'Carotti A', 'Falzetti F', 'Terenzi A', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']",,"['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. andrea.velardi@unipg.it.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,,2019/08/23 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0597-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0597-y [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Aug;54(Suppl 2):775-779. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0597-y.,20200908,775-779,,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*physiopathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, limited T cell persistence and inherent leukemia resistance mechanisms have led us, as well as others, to this clinical decision making, and are hereby reviewed.","['Jacoby, Elad']",['Jacoby E'],,"[""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, and Department of Pediatrics, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

From 2005 to 2015 numbers of HaploSCT increased by close to 300%. In parallel, there is a major shift from T deplete (CD34+ megadose) to T replete (non-T deplete) HaploSCT. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis also changed from CD34+ cell purifications to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and lately to post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Novel conditioning regimens have been developed incorporating novel drugs and innovative approaches. Results are persistently improving and currently, registry-based and single-center studies showed no statistical significance difference in transplantation outcome between HaploSCT to alloSCT from unrelated donors and even from HLA-matched sibling donors, although the numbers of those studies are small and the lack of randomized studies available so far. HaploSCT have several advantages and such as the possibility to choose between different potential donors. Parameters to consider in the Haplo donor selection are age, gender, kinship, ABO blood group, CMV status, non-shared HLA Haplotypes and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR). Future goals are to further decrease transplant-related mortality currently mainly due to infection complications and reduce relapse rates especially in patients with high-risk acute leukemia.","['Nagler, Arnon', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa']","['Nagler A', 'Ruggeri A']",,"['Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.

We have previously reported that AICAr promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells. Here, using metabolic assays, immunoblotting, flow cytometry analyses, and siRNA-mediated gene silencing in leukemia cell lines, we show that AICAr-mediated differentiation was independent of the known metabolic effects of AMPK, including glucose consumption, but instead depends on the activation of the DNA damage-associated enzyme checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) induced by pyrimidine depletion. LC/MS/MS metabolomics analysis revealed that AICAr increases orotate levels and decreases uridine monophosphate (UMP) levels, consistent with inhibition of UMP synthesis at a step downstream of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). AICAr and the DHODH inhibitor brequinar had similar effects on differentiation markers and S-phase arrest, and genetic or pharmacological Chk1 inactivation abrogated both of these effects. Our results delineate an AMPK-independent effect of AICAr on myeloid leukemia differentiation that involves perturbation of pyrimidine biosynthesis and activation of the DNA damage response network.","['Dembitz, Vilma', 'Tomic, Barbara', 'Kodvanj, Ivan', 'Simon, Julian A', 'Bedalov, Antonio', 'Visnjic, Dora']","['Dembitz V', 'Tomic B', 'Kodvanj I', 'Simon JA', 'Bedalov A', 'Visnjic D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9463-253X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2207-7191']","['Department of Physiology and Croatian Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology and Croatian Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology and Croatian Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109.', 'Department of Physiology and Croatian Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia visnjic@mef.hr.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA206462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM117446/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190820,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC6802504,['NOTNLM'],"['*AICAr', '*AML', '*AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)', '*Chk1', '*DNA damage response', '*cell cycle', '*cell differentiation', '*leukemia', '*nucleotide', '*pyrimidine']",2019/08/23 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/22 06:00'],"['2019/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)33771-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.009396 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Oct 18;294(42):15257-15270. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009396.

Clinical resistance arises from AR overexpression or ligand-independent constitutive activation, suggesting that complete AR elimination could be a novel therapeutic strategy in prostate cancers. IRC117539 is a new molecule that targets AR for proteasomal degradation. Exposure to IRC117539 promotes AR sumoylation and ubiquitination, reminiscent of therapy-induced PML/RARA degradation in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Critically, ex vivo, IRC117539-mediated AR degradation induces prostate cancer cell viability loss by inhibiting AR signaling, even in androgen-insensitive cells. This approach may be beneficial for castration-resistant prostate cancer, which remains a clinical issue. In xenograft models, IRC117539 is as potent as enzalutamide in impeding growth, albeit less efficient than expected from ex vivo studies. Unexpectedly, IRC117539 also behaves as a weak proteasome inhibitor, likely explaining its suboptimal efficacy in vivo.

In addition, in vitro functional experiments revealed that overexpression of miR-206 significantly inhibited AML cell proliferation partly through induction of cell cycle arrest. Further studies showed that Cyclin D1 might be a direct target of miR-206 in AML cells, and the impaired proliferation ability of miR-206-overexpressing AML cells was notably rescued by Cyclin D1 restoration.

The N-desmethyl-metabolite of imatinib is substantially less active than imatinib as a BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, thus providing an explanation as to why patients producing high levels of this metabolite show a relatively low response rate in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) treatment. The hydroxymethylphenyl and N-oxide metabolites of imatinib and nilotinib are only weakly active as BCR-ABL1 inhibitors and are unlikely to play a role in the efficacy of either drug in CML.

To develop an alternative approach to CML therapy, we are exploring siRNA mediated silencing of the primary CML oncogene, BCR-ABL, by using non-viral (polymeric) delivery systems. In this study, a group of lipopolymers derived from low molecular PEIs substituted with linoleic acid (LA), alpha-linolenic acid (alphaLA) and cholesterol (Chol) was investigated for the first time for siRNA delivery to CML primary samples. The delivery efficiency in primary cells was equivalent to CML K562 cell line, and the lipopolymers gave effective internalization of siRNA depending on the nature of lipid substituent. The PEI-alphaLA (2.5 alphaLA/PEI), PEI-Chol (2.2 Chol/PEI), and PEI-LA (2.6 LA/PEI) lipopolymers used as BCR-ABL siRNA carriers (at 60nM siRNA) reduced the BCR-ABL mRNA expression by 17% to 45%, and inhibited the formation of colonies by 24% to 41% in comparison with control siRNA in mononuclear cells. BCR-ABL siRNA treatment reduced the BCR-ABL mRNA expression by 50% in one of two CD34+ samples tested, and combination of BCR-ABL siRNA with imatinib (IM) treatment decreased the colony formation by 65% in one of two samples evaluated. The fact that no single polymer was universally effective in all patient samples may suggest patient-to-patient variability in terms of therapeutic responses to siRNA therapy. These results showed that a low dose of BCR-ABL siRNA could be used with lipopolymers to reduce BCR-ABL mRNA expression, CML cell survival and colony formation. This proof of principle study in CML primary cells can be applied to silencing of other therapeutic targets besides BCR-ABL and a study with larger patient samples is warranted for better identification of effective siRNA carriers.","['Valencia-Serna, Juliana', 'Kucharski, Cezary', 'Chen, Min', 'Kc, Remant', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Valencia-Serna J', 'Kucharski C', 'Chen M', 'Kc R', 'Jiang X', 'Brandwein J', 'Uludag H']",,"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, AB, Canada.

Heretofore, the association of MYH8 mutation and cancer is unclear. In this study, we investigated the biologic significance of novel MYH8 tail truncation mutation, R1292X, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which was discovered by whole-exome sequencing and targeted re-sequencing of 209 AML patients. The patients harboring the mutation all relapsed within 3.8-20.9 months. To explore the functional consequence of the mutation in AML progress, we established knock-in cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Using the established mutant model, we assessed traits of cancer progress. The mutant cells had improved motility, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, wound healing, transwell migration and adhesion assay. The cell morphology and cell cycle were altered to be accessible to migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors were also increased. The Raf and p44/42 MAPK pathway was a major regulator of these characteristics proved by a screening of signal transduction and inhibitor assay. Further, a public cancer genome database (cBioPortal) shows that MYH8 tail truncation mutations occurring near the R1292 position of the genome may have a significant function in cancer. In conclusion, truncation of MYH8 could be a novel prognostic marker related to poor prognosis by inducing cell migration and EMT features, and inhibition of the Raf/MAPK pathway would be a therapeutic strategy for AML patients with MYH8 tail truncation.","['Park, Hyejoo', 'Kim, Daeyoon', 'Kim, Dongchan', 'Park, Jihyun', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Park H', 'Kim D', 'Kim D', 'Park J', 'Koh Y', 'Yoon SS']",,"['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['5552341 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgz146 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2020 Jul 10;41(6):817-827. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgz146.,20201027,817-827,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

More recently, humanized RBL cell lines saw the introduction of reporter genes such as luciferase (RS-ATL8) and DsRed (RBL NFAT-DsRed). These reporters are more sensitive than their parental non-reporter humanized RBL cell lines. However, no studies so far have addressed the levels of FcepsilonRIH surface expression on humanized RBL cell lines. This is a critical parameter, as it determines the ability of these cells to be efficiently sensitized with human IgE, hence it should affect the sensitivity of the cell assay-a critical parameter for any diagnostic application. Our purpose was to assess and compare the levels of expression of the transfected FcepsilonRIH chain in humanized RBL cell lines. We compared surface levels of FcepsilonRIalphaH by flow cytometry, using a fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibody (CRA-1/AER-37) and determined receptor numbers using calibration microspheres. FcepsilonRIalphaH copy numbers were assessed by qPCR, and the sequence verified. Transfection with FcepsilonRIgammaH cDNA was assessed for its ability to increase FcepsilonRIalphaH expression in the NFAT-DsRed reporter. While both SX-38 and RS-ATL8 expressed about 500.000 receptors/cell, RBL 703-21 and NFAT-DsRed had approximately 10- to 30-fold lower FcepsilonRIalphaH expression, respectively. This was neither related to FcepsilonRIH gene copy numbers, nor to differences in steady state mRNA levels, as determined by qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively. Instead, FcepsilonRIalphaH surface expression appeared to correlate with the co-expression of FcepsilonRIgammaH. Stable transfection of NFAT-DsRed cells with pBJ1 neo-huFcepsilonRI gamma, which constitutively expresses FcepsilonRIgammaH, increased FcepsilonRIalphaH chain expression levels. Levels of FcepsilonRIalphaH surface expression vary greatly between humanized RBL reporter cell lines. This difference will affect the sensitivity of the reporter system when used for diagnostic purposes.","['Ali, Eman Ali', 'Kalli, Marina', 'Wan, Daniel', 'Nakamura, Ryosuke', 'Onion, David', 'Alanine, Daniel G W', 'Alcocer, Marcos J C', 'Falcone, Franco H']","['Ali EA', 'Kalli M', 'Wan D', 'Nakamura R', 'Onion D', 'Alanine DGW', 'Alcocer MJC', 'Falcone FH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7491-3414', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7756-3798', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1732-9932']","['Division of Molecular Therapeutics and Formulation, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Therapeutics and Formulation, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Therapeutics and Formulation, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'National Institute of Health Sciences, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Therapeutics and Formulation, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Therapeutics and Formulation, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190820,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6701790,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0221034 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-06705 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Aug 20;14(8):e0221034. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221034. eCollection 2019.,20200402,e0221034,,"['0 (FCER1A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The 2017 European LeukemiaNet guidelines assume this is true regardless of accompanying cytogenetic abnormalities. We investigated the validity of this assumption. METHODS: We analyzed associations between karyotype and outcome in intensively treated patients with NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) AML who were prospectively enrolled in registry databases from nine international study groups or treatment centers. RESULTS: Among 2,426 patients with NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) AML, 2,000 (82.4%) had a normal and 426 (17.6%) had an abnormal karyotype, including 329 patients (13.6%) with intermediate and 83 patients (3.4%) with adverse-risk chromosomal abnormalities. In patients with NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) AML, adverse cytogenetics were associated with lower complete remission rates (87.7%, 86.0%, and 66.3% for normal, aberrant intermediate, and adverse karyotype, respectively; P < .001), inferior 5-year overall (52.4%, 44.8%, 19.5%, respectively; P < .001) and event-free survival (40.6%, 36.0%, 18.1%, respectively; P < .001), and a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (43.6%, 44.2%, 51.9%, respectively; P = .0012). These associations remained in multivariable mixed-effects regression analyses adjusted for known clinicopathologic risk factors (P < .001 for all end points). In patients with adverse-risk chromosomal aberrations, we found no significant influence of the NPM1 mutational status on outcome. CONCLUSION: Karyotype abnormalities are significantly associated with outcome in NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) AML. When adverse-risk cytogenetics are present, patients with NPM1(mut) share the same unfavorable prognosis as patients with NPM1 wild type and should be classified and treated accordingly. Thus, cytogenetic risk predominates over molecular risk in NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) AML.","['Angenendt, Linus', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Garcia, Raimundo', 'Botella, Carmen', 'Martinez, Pilar', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Lazarevic, Vladimir', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Recher, Christian', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Dumas, Pierre-Yves', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Terre, Christine', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Novak, Jan', 'Zak, Pavel', 'Wei, Andrew H', 'Tiong, Ing S', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Shaw, Carole', 'Exeler, Rita', 'Wagenfuhr, Lisa', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Mikesch, Jan-Henrik', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Krug, Utz', 'Schliemann, Christoph']","['Angenendt L', 'Rollig C', 'Montesinos P', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Barragan E', 'Garcia R', 'Botella C', 'Martinez P', 'Ravandi F', 'Kadia T', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes J', 'Juliusson G', 'Lazarevic V', 'Hoglund M', 'Lehmann S', 'Recher C', 'Pigneux A', 'Bertoli S', 'Dumas PY', 'Dombret H', 'Preudhomme C', 'Micol JB', 'Terre C', 'Racil Z', 'Novak J', 'Zak P', 'Wei AH', 'Tiong IS', 'Wall M', 'Estey E', 'Shaw C', 'Exeler R', 'Wagenfuhr L', 'Stolzel F', 'Thiede C', 'Stelljes M', 'Lenz G', 'Mikesch JH', 'Serve H', 'Ehninger G', 'Berdel WE', 'Kramer M', 'Krug U', 'Schliemann C']",,"['University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'University Hospital of the Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia;

It offers a platform both for non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted alloimmunity due to killer-like immunoglobulin receptor (KIR)-mediated mechanisms of natural killer lymphocyte regulation and for classical T-cell mediated antileukemic effects. OBJECTIVES: The devastating long-term sequelae after total body irradiation (TBI) in children are encouraging omission of irradiation techniques in pediatric stem cell transplantations (SCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five children, 4 with acute leukemia and 1 with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, aged from 1 to 10 years, underwent haploSCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. In all children, the conditioning regimen consisted of chemotherapy without TBI. The graft material was bone marrow (BM) in 4 cases and peripheral blood stem cells in 1 case. Three out of 5 leukemic patients showed better KIR haplotype associated with augmented alloreactivity. RESULTS: Engraftment with complete donor chimerism was achieved in 4 patients, and 1 recipient died before leukocyte recovery. Three patients developed skin acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGvHD), 1 gut aGvHD and 1 liver aGvHD. In 2 recipients, chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD) was observed (1 limited and 1 extensive). The 4 engrafted patients were alive and in complete remission 3, 9, 32, and 36 months after transplantation. A T-cell count of 200 cells/uL was reached 90 days after haploSCT in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: HaploSCT with TBI-free protocols can be a viable option for heavily pretreated patients with advanced malignancies.","['Wawrzyniak-Dzierzek, Elzbieta', 'Gajek, Kornelia', 'Slezak, Aleksandra', 'Rybka, Blanka', 'Ryczan-Krawczyk, Renata', 'Gorczynska, Ewa', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Ussowicz, Marek']","['Wawrzyniak-Dzierzek E', 'Gajek K', 'Slezak A', 'Rybka B', 'Ryczan-Krawczyk R', 'Gorczynska E', 'Kalwak K', 'Ussowicz M']",,"['Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,,['NOTNLM'],"['TBI-free', 'haploidentical', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'pediatric', 'post-transplant cyclophosphamide']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/104688 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2019 Sep;28(9):1223-1228. doi: 10.17219/acem/104688.,20191021,1223-1228,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', '*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A total number of 5628 patients with newly diagnosed malignancies and 971 patients after HCT (741 allo-HCT and 230 auto-HCT) were screened for infectious complications in biennial reports. IFD incidence was lower among PHO patients: 8.8% vs 21.2% (P < .0001) and survival from IFD was better: 94.2% vs 84.1% (P < .0001). Auto-HCT patients had lower incidence (10.9% vs 24.4%) and lower mortality than allo-HCT patients. Introduction of national antifungal prophylaxis programme in HCT and acute leukaemia patients decreased incidence of IFD in HCT (from 23.1% to 13.4%) and AML on conventional chemotherapy (from 36% to 23%) but not in ALL patients during chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, the incidence of IFD was higher in patients after HCT, diagnosed for ALL, AML or NHL, and in patients > 10 years old. Factors contributing to death with infection were as follows: undergoing HCT, diagnosis of acute leukaemia (ALL or AML) and duration of treatment of infection > 21 days. In conclusion, the incidence of IFD in allo-HCT and in AML patients on chemotherapy has decreased after introduction of national programme of antifungal prophylaxis, while the incidence of IFD in ALL patients on chemotherapy did not change significantly. The outcome of IFD both in PHO and HCT patients has largely improved in comparison with historical international data.","['Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Galazka, Przemyslaw', 'Fraczkiewicz, Jowita', 'Salamonowicz, Malgorzata', 'Szmydki-Baran, Anna', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Gryniewicz-Kwiatkowska, Olga', 'Zalas-Wiecek, Patrycja', 'Chelmecka-Wiktorczyk, Liliana', 'Irga-Jaworska, Ninela', 'Bien, Ewa', 'Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Wawrykow, Pawel', 'Tomaszewska, Renata', 'Plonowski, Marcin', 'Pierlejewski, Filip', 'Gamrot-Pyka, Zuzanna', 'Malas, Zofia', 'Urbanek-Dadela, Agnieszka', 'Stolpa, Weronika', 'Zaucha-Prazmo, Agnieszka', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Chaber, Radoslaw', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Czyzewski K', 'Galazka P', 'Fraczkiewicz J', 'Salamonowicz M', 'Szmydki-Baran A', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Gryniewicz-Kwiatkowska O', 'Zalas-Wiecek P', 'Chelmecka-Wiktorczyk L', 'Irga-Jaworska N', 'Bien E', 'Ociepa T', 'Wawrykow P', 'Tomaszewska R', 'Plonowski M', 'Pierlejewski F', 'Gamrot-Pyka Z', 'Malas Z', 'Urbanek-Dadela A', 'Stolpa W', 'Zaucha-Prazmo A', 'Gozdzik J', 'Chaber R', 'Gil L', 'Styczynski J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7704-7518', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3158-119X']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", 'Department of Microbiology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Silesian Medical University, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Chorzow Pediatric and Oncology Center, Chorzow, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital, Kielce, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Department of Pediatric, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Center, Department of Clinical Immunology and Transplantology, University Children's Hospital, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,,['NOTNLM'],"['bacterial infections', 'children', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'invasive fungal infections', 'malignant diseases', 'oncohematology', 'viral infections']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.12990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2019 Nov;62(11):990-998. doi: 10.1111/myc.12990.,20200224,990-998,['(c) 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the activities of propofol in cancer stem cells have not been elucidated. In this work, we examined the effects and mechanisms of propofol on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) differentiated and CD34(+) CD38(-) stem cells. We found that propofol inhibited growth, differentiation and self-renewal capabilities of AML stem cells regardless of cellular origin and genetic profiling. In addition, propofol inhibited the growth of AML differentiated cells. Propofol significantly induced apoptosis of AML differentiated but not CD34(+) CD38(-) stem cells. We further found that propofol significantly augmented the efficacy of AML standard therapeutic drugs. Consistent with the previous findings, we showed that propofol suppressed the Akt/mTOR pathway in AML cells. We also found that propofol inhibited pathways important for stem cell maintenance and self-renewal, such as Wnt/beta-catenin. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt partially reversed the inhibitory effects of propofol in AML differentiated cells. Stabilization of beta-catenin using genetic and pharmacological approaches also partially rescued the inhibitory effects of propofol in AML differentiated and stem cells. Our work shows that propofol targets leukaemia cells at all stages of development, in a cell type-specific manner. Inhibition of both Akt/mTOR and Wnt/beta-catenin is required for the action of propofol in AML. Our findings also highlight the activities of propofol on cancer stem cells.","['Chen, Liufang', 'Wan, Yingchun', 'Liu, Youtan', 'Li, Tao']","['Chen L', 'Wan Y', 'Liu Y', 'Li T']",,"['Department of Anesthesiology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190917,Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Akt/mTOR', '*Wnt/beta-catenin', '*leukaemia stem cell', '*propofol']",2019/08/21 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1440-1681.13167 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2020 Jan;47(1):127-134. doi: 10.1111/1440-1681.13167.

Nucleic acid tests for HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 are used to confirm infection with HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 and are also used for the follow-up of HTLV-1 related diseases. To prepare a highly sensitive method that can discern infection with HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, a multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) by large-scale primer screening was developed. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by serial dilution of cell lines and by testing with known clinical samples. The resulting multiplex qPCR can detect about four copies of HTLV-1 provirus per 10(5) cells. Moreover, HTLV-1 provirus could be detected in 97.2% (205 of 211) of HTLV-1 seropositive clinical samples. These sensitivities were sufficiently high compared with the methods reported previously. Also, all the HTLV-2 seropositive clinical samples tested were found to be positive by this method (three of three). In conclusion, this method can successfully and simultaneously detect both types of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 provirus with extremely high sensitivity.","['Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Okuma, Kazu', 'Tezuka, Kenta', 'Nakamura, Hitomi', 'Sagara, Yasuko', 'Kurane, Ichiro', 'Hamaguchi, Isao']","['Kuramitsu M', 'Okuma K', 'Tezuka K', 'Nakamura H', 'Sagara Y', 'Kurane I', 'Hamaguchi I']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3064-5219'],"['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['JP19fk0108037j/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20190911,Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'HTLV-2', 'diagnosis', 'provirus', 'quantitative PCR']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1348-0421.12740 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2019 Nov;63(11):458-464. doi: 10.1111/1348-0421.12740.

MicroRNA-21, as an oncomir, is up-regulated in almost all cancer types such as leukemia which results in cell proliferation. In this study, we examine the ability of leukemia microvesicles to induce proliferation in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) via microRNA-21 dysregulation. Herein, leukemia microvesicles were isolated from HL-60 and NB-4 cell lines by ultracentrifugation, and then their protein content was measured. Normal HSPCs were isolated from umbilical cord blood samples by a CD-34 antibody. These cells were treated with 20 and 40 mug/mL leukemia microvesicles for 5 and 10 days, respectively. Cell count, CD-34 analysis, and a microRNA-21 gene expression assay were done at days 5 and 10. HSPCs showed a significant increase in both microRNA-21 gene expression and cell count after treating with leukemia microvesicles compared with the control group. CD-34 analysis as stemness proof did not show any difference among the studied groups. This data suggests that HSPC proliferation followed by microRNA-21 gene over expression can be another evidence of a leukemia-like phenotype induction in a healthy target cell by leukemia microvesicles.","['Razmkhah, Farnaz', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Ghasemi, Sorayya', 'Kafi-Abad, Sedigheh Amini']","['Razmkhah F', 'Soleimani M', 'Ghasemi S', 'Kafi-Abad SA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3321-7938'],"['Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190815,Brazil,Genet Mol Biol,Genetics and molecular biology,100883590,PMC6726151,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2019/08/21 06:01,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:01 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1415-47572019005033101 [pii]', '10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2018-0073 [doi]']",ppublish,Genet Mol Biol. 2019 Apr-Jun;42(2):465-471. doi: 10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2018-0073.

The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of CDK4/6 inhibition on mast cell activation in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells (BLCs) and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were sensitized with anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies, stimulated with DNP-human serum albumin (HSA) antigens, and treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Histological stains were applied to reveal cytomorphological changes. Murine IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) models were used to examine palbociclib effects on allergic reactions in vivo. Western blots were performed to detect the expression of cell signaling molecules associated with mast cell activation. RESULTS: Activated BLCs and BMMCs released copious granule-related mediators (histamine and beta-hexosaminidase), which was reduced by palbociclib in a concentration-dependent manner. Palbociclib inhibited expression of the mast cell activation marker CD63 in activated BLCs and inhibited granule release (visualized with toluidine blue staining) while preventing morphological changes, (elongated shape maintained) and filamentous actin (F-actin) reorganization. Palbociclib suppressed molecular Lyn and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling associated with mast cell activation in stimulated BLCs and attenuated allergic reactions in PCA mice dose dependently. Palbociclib attenuated body temperature reduction and diminished serum histamine levels in ovalbumin OVA-challenged ASA mice. CONCLUSION: Palbociclib suppresses IgE-mediated mast cell activation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it may be developed into a therapy for mast cell-mediated allergic diseases via inhibition of mast cell degranulation.","['Hou, Yi-Bo', 'Ji, Kunmei', 'Sun, Yue-Tong', 'Zhang, Li-Na', 'Chen, Jia-Jie']","['Hou YB', 'Ji K', 'Sun YT', 'Zhang LN', 'Chen JJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1372-8450'],"[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China. chenjj@szu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190820,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,PMC6702723,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK inhibitor', '*Drug repurposing', '*Mast cells', '*Palbociclib']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-2026-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-2026-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2019 Aug 20;17(1):276. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-2026-9.,20200622,276,,"['0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the application of CAR-T cells is obviously hampered by the adverse effects, such as cytokines release syndrome and on-target off-tumor toxicity. In some clinical trials, patients quitted the treatment of CAR-T cells due to life-threatening toxicity. Seeking to alleviate these toxicities or prevent the occurrence, researchers have developed a number of safety strategies of CAR-T cells, including suicide genes, synthetic Notch receptor, on-switch CAR, combinatorial target-antigen recognition, bispecific T cell engager and inhibitory CAR.

Aims of this study were to characterize ICGN by light and electron microscopy and identify associations with clinico-pathological findings. In addition, comparisons between cats with ICGN and non immune-complex glomerulonephritis (non-ICGN) were performed. Renal samples examined between 2010 and 2019 were considered if both light and electron microscopy were performed. Signalment, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and leukemia virus (FeLV) status, serum creatinine concentration, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage were retrieved and used for comparisons. RESULTS: Sixty-eight client-owned cats were included. Thirty-seven cats (54.4%) had ICGN and 31 (45.6%) non-ICGN. Eighteen (48.6%) with ICGN had membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN), 14 (37.8%) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and 5 (13.5%) mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MeGN). Clinico-pathological data were not associated with any type of ICGN. Among cats with non-ICGN, 11 (35.5%) had end-stage CKD, 9 (29%) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 6 (19.4%) global and multifocal mesangiosclerosis, 2 (6.5%) glomerular atrophy, 2 (6.5%) renal dysplasia and 1 (3.1%) amyloidosis. Eight (25.8%) cats with non-ICGN had chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) grade 1, 13 (41.9%) grade 2 and 10 (32.3%) grade 3; creatinine and UPC ratio increased with CIN grades (p = 0.001, p < 0.001). Cats with ICGN were more frequently FIV or FeLV-infected (OR:11.4; 95%CI:1.4-94.4; p = 0.024), had higher UPC ratio (OR:6.8; 95%CI:2.5-18.2; p < 0.001) and were younger (OR:0.9; 95%CI:0.7-1.0; p = 0.042) than cats with non-ICGN. CONCLUSIONS: MGN and MPGN were the most common morphological diagnoses of ICGN in cats. Unfortunately, none of the investigated findings differentiated ICGN morphological diagnoses. Serum creatinine concentration and UPC ratio were directly associated with grades of CIN (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), confirming previous literature. More ICGN than non-ICGN was observed in cats with retroviral infections, younger cats and higher UPC ratio.","['Rossi, Francesco', 'Aresu, Luca', 'Martini, Valeria', 'Trez, Davide', 'Zanetti, Rossella', 'Coppola, Luigi Michele', 'Ferri, Filippo', 'Zini, Eric']","['Rossi F', 'Aresu L', 'Martini V', 'Trez D', 'Zanetti R', 'Coppola LM', 'Ferri F', 'Zini E']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9576-8191'],"['Istituto Veterinario di Novara, Strada Provinciale 9, 28060 Granozzo con Monticello (NO), Novara, Italy. francesco.rossi@anicura.it.', 'Department of Veterinary Science, University of Turin, Largo Braccini 2, 10095, Grugliasco (TO), Italy.', ""Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, via dell'Universita, 26900, Lodi, Italy."", ""Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padua, Viale dell'Universita 16, 35020 Agripolis Legnaro (PD), Legnaro, Italy."", ""Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padua, Viale dell'Universita 16, 35020 Agripolis Legnaro (PD), Legnaro, Italy."", ""Department of Animal Medicine, Production and Health, University of Padua, Viale dell'Universita 16, 35020 Agripolis Legnaro (PD), Legnaro, Italy."", 'Istituto Veterinario di Novara, Strada Provinciale 9, 28060 Granozzo con Monticello (NO), Novara, Italy.', 'Istituto Veterinario di Novara, Strada Provinciale 9, 28060 Granozzo con Monticello (NO), Novara, Italy.', ""Department of Animal Medicine, Production and Health, University of Padua, Viale dell'Universita 16, 35020 Agripolis Legnaro (PD), Legnaro, Italy."", 'Clinic for Small Animal Internal Medicine, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190820,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,PMC6702729,['NOTNLM'],"['Feline', 'Immune-deposits', 'Kidney', 'Proteinuria', 'Transmission electron microscopy']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-019-2046-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-019-2046-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2019 Aug 20;15(1):303. doi: 10.1186/s12917-019-2046-y.,20200106,303,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Immune Complex Diseases/pathology/*veterinary', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this prospective single arm study (ChiCTR-OPC-15006492), we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel consolidation therapy with low-dose decitabine (LD-DAC) priming with intermediate-dose cytarabine (ID-Ara-C) followed by umbilical cord blood (UCB) infusion in elderly patients with AML. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with a median age of 64-years-old (60-74-years-old) who achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: The 2-year actual overall survival (OS) rate and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 68.0 and 60.0%, respectively. The hematological and non-hematological toxicity were mild to moderate, and only one patient died in remission due to infection with possible acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). Compared to a concurrent cohort of patients receiving conventional consolidation therapy, the study group tended to have an improved OS and LFS (p = 0.046 and 0.057, respectively), while the toxicity was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested the novel combination of LD-DAC, ID-Ara-C, and UCB infusion might be an optimal consolidation therapy for elderly patients with AML, and a prospective phase III randomized study is warranted to confirm this observation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This single-arm phase II clinical trial in elderly AML patients was registered prospectively at www.chictr.org.cn (identifier: ChiCTR-OPC-15006492 ) on June 2, 2015.","['Li,

Current protocols do not advocate tapering of GCs doses postinduction phase. Prolonged administration of supra-physiologic doses of GCs can induce transient suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA). Timely recognition of adrenal insufficiency is important in order to ensure that children at risk receive the necessary treatment and follow-up including stress coverage during illness and surgical procedures. Methods: 21 newly diagnosed patients with ALL aged 3-10 years old were prospectively enrolled in the study over a 2-year period. All enrolled patients received high doses of GCs as part of a chemotherapy treatment protocol. The HPA axis was assessed prior to the induction phase of chemotherapy and 1-2 weeks after un-tapered discontinuation of GCs. Results: All children had normal HPA axis at baseline. Postinduction 1 mcg ACTH stimulation test result was normal (cortisol > 500 nmol/L) in 75% of children and partially responsive in 25% (cortisol 300-500 nmol/L). None of the participants demonstrated clinically significant adrenal insufficiency following abrupt cessation of GCs. Conclusion: All children in our cohort had either normal or subnormal cortisol response during a low dose ACTH stimulation test 1 to 2 weeks following abrupt discontinuation of GCs, suggesting that any inhibition of the HPA axis is of short duration. We suggest that future studies investigate the timing of adrenal function recovery following GC discontinuation as well as whether tapering of the GC should be recommended.","['Ahmad, Noman', 'Abosoudah, Ibraheem Faisal', 'Sobaihi, Mrouge Mohamed', 'Algiraigri, Ali Hassan', 'Roujouleh, Farh', 'Ghurab, Fatima', 'Chanoine, Jean-Pierre']","['Ahmad N', 'Abosoudah IF', 'Sobaihi MM', 'Algiraigri AH', 'Roujouleh F', 'Ghurab F', 'Chanoine JP']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4841-8380', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5167-2064']","['Consultant Pediatric Endocrinology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'Consultant Pediatric Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'Consultant Pediatric Endocrinology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'Consultant Pediatric Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdulaziz university hospital , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'Resident General Pediatrics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'Resident General Pediatrics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', ""Clinical Professor and Head, Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, British Columbia Children's Hospital , Vancouver Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190820,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis', 'acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'glucocorticoids']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/02/07 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1652710 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;36(7):422-431. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1652710.

OBJECTIVE.-: To evaluate diagnostic features of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with Down syndrome. DESIGN.-: Diagnostic bone marrow samples from 163 patients enrolled in the Children's Oncology Group study AAML0431 were evaluated by using central morphologic review and institutional immunophenotyping. Results were compared to overall survival, event-free survival, GATA1 mutation status, cytogenetics, and minimal residual disease results. RESULTS.-: Sixty myelodysplastic syndrome and 103 acute myeloid leukemia samples were reviewed. Both had distinctive features compared to those of patients without Down syndrome. They showed megakaryocytic and erythroid but little myeloid dysplasia, and marked megakaryocytic hyperplasia with unusual megakaryocyte morphology. In acute myeloid leukemia cases, megakaryoblastic differentiation of blasts was most common (54 of 103, 52%); other cases showed erythroblastic (11 of 103, 11%), mixed erythroid/megakaryoblastic (20 of 103, 19%), or no differentiation (10 of 103, 10%). Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia cases had similar event-free survival and overall survival. Leukemic subgroups showed interesting, but not statistically significant, trends for survival and minimal residual disease. Cases with institutional diagnoses of French American British M1-5 morphology showed typical features of Down syndrome disease, with survival approaching that of other cases. CONCLUSIONS.-: Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome display features that allow discrimination from standard cases of disease. These distinctions are important for treatment decisions, and for understanding disease pathogenesis. We propose specific diagnostic criteria for Down syndrome-related subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Mast, Kelley J', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Mosse, Claudio A', 'Mathew, Prasad', 'Berman, Jason N', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Jones, Heath M', 'Campana, Dario', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Hitzler, Johann K', 'Head, David R']","['Mast KJ', 'Taub JW', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gamis AS', 'Mosse CA', 'Mathew P', 'Berman JN', 'Wang YC', 'Jones HM', 'Campana D', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch B', 'Hitzler JK', 'Head DR']",,"[""From the Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee (Drs Mast, Mosse, Jones, and Head); the Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Wayne State University, Detroit (Dr Taub); the Department of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, Monrovia (Dr Alonzo and Mr Wang); the Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri (Dr Gamis); the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville (Dr Mosse); the Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque (Dr Mathew); the Division of Hematology-Oncology, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada (Dr Berman); the Departments of Oncology (Dr Campana and Ms Coustan-Smith) and Pathology (Dr Raimondi), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; the Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, The National University Cancer Institute, NUH Medical Centre, Singapore (Dr Campana and Ms Coustan-Smith); the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis (Dr Hirsch); the Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Dr Hitzler); and the Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Dr Hitzler).

METHODS: Thirty-seven newly diagnosed E/R-positive ALL children and six controls were included in this study. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression level of METTL3 and METTL14. RESULTS: Among the 37 cases, 51.35% (n = 19) were boys and 48.65% (n = 18) were girls and the median age was 4.72 (1.72-11.99) years. Among the six controls, 50% (n = 3) were boys and 50% (n = 3) were girls and the median age was 5.24 (1.53-13.17) years. The expression level of METTL3 and METTL14 in E/R-positive ALL patients were lower than in controls (p < .05). Although failed to achieve statistical significance, the expression level of METTL3 and METTL14 in relapse patients were lower than nonrelapse patients (p = .171, p = .150, respectively). CONCLUSION: The reduced levels of METTL3 and METTL14 suggest a possible role in the pathogenesis and course of E/R-positive ALL. METTL3 and METTL14 may become new prognostic factors, and rationalize specific treatment intensification in possible E/R-positive relapse patients.","['Sun, Congcong', 'Chang, Lixian', 'Liu, Chao', 'Chen, Xiaoyan', 'Zhu, Xiaofan']","['Sun C', 'Chang L', 'Liu C', 'Chen X', 'Zhu X']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3777-729X'],"['Center for Pediatric Blood Disease, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, P.R.

Although 5.7% of samples were positive for p27 antigen, reactivity appeared to be non-specific because no ALV was detected in the corresponding DF-1 cultures. To further determine whether geese are susceptible to ALV-J isolated from chickens, ALV-J strain JS09GY7 was artificially inoculated into 10-day-old goose embryos, with one-day-old hatched goslings then screened for p27 antigen and the presence of ALV. In all cases, the results of both tests were negative. Liver tissues from the 1-day-old goslings were screened using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay, which failed to amplify ALV-J gene fragments from any of the samples. Further, no histopathological damage was observed in the liver tissues. ALV-J was further inoculated intraperitoneally into one-day-old goslings, with cloacal swabs samples and plasma samples then collected every 5 days for 30 days. All samples were again negative for the presence of p27 antigen and ALV, and liver tissues from the challenged geese showed no histopathological damage and were negative for the presence of ALV-J gene fragments. Furthermore, p27 antigen detection, PCR-based screening, and indirect immunofluorescence assays were all negative following the infection of goose embryo fibroblasts with ALV-J. Together, these results confirm that virulent chicken-derived ALV-J strains cannot infect geese, and that p27 antigen detection in goose serum is susceptible to non-specific interference.","['Mu, Xiaohui', 'Xu, Moru', 'Zhu, Shanyuan', 'Xiao, Wenhua', 'Shen, Xi', 'Qin, Aijian']","['Mu X', 'Xu M', 'Zhu S', 'Xiao W', 'Shen X', 'Qin A']",,"[""Jiangsu Agri-animal Husbandry Vocational College, Taizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Ministry of Education Key Lab for Avian Preventive Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Agri-animal Husbandry Vocational College, Taizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Agri-animal Husbandry Vocational College, Taizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Ministry of Education Key Lab for Avian Preventive Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Ministry of Education Key Lab for Avian Preventive Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial, Veterinary']",20190909,England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALV-J', 'Goose', 'avian leukosis virus', 'chicken', 'infection', 'p27 antigen']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03079457.2019.1657559 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Pathol. 2020 Feb;49(1):29-35. doi: 10.1080/03079457.2019.1657559.

High relapse rates after consolidation therapy and after allogeneic stem cell transplant contribute to suboptimal outcomes in AML patients, and continue to represent a difficult challenge. Effective maintenance therapy could play an important role in prolonging the remission interval in the post-consolidation setting, especially in high risk AML patients. Maintenance treatment approaches based on conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hypomethylating agents, and targeted small molecules have been explored in this setting, but no data so far have been convincing enough to establish this approach as the standard of care. However, ongoing and future studies including novel targeted therapies may demonstrate promising efficacy that could facilitate incorporation of maintenance therapy into clinical practice. In this review we summarize previous and ongoing approaches of maintenance therapy in AML and discuss the most promising strategies.","['Molica, Matteo', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Foa, Roberto', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kadia, Tapan M']","['Molica M', 'Breccia M', 'Foa R', 'Jabbour E', 'Kadia TM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1163-6162', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832']","['Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, University Sapienza Rome, Roma, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, University Sapienza Rome, Roma, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, University Sapienza Rome, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public,', 'commercial, or not-for-profit sectors/International']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190911,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25620 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Nov;94(11):1254-1265. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25620.

Microarray gene expression (MGE) data plays a major role in predicting type of cancer. But as MGE data is huge in volume, applying traditional data mining approaches is time consuming. Hence parallel programming frameworks like Hadoop, Spark and Mahout are necessary to ease the task of computation. OBJECTIVE: Not all the gene expressions are necessary in prediction, it is very essential to select important genes for improving classification accuracy. So feature selection algorithms are parallelized and executed on Spark framework to eliminate unnecessary genes and identify only predictive genes in very less time without affecting prediction accuracy. METHODS: Parallelized hybrid feature selection (HFS) method is proposed to serve the purpose. This method includes parallelized correlation feature subset selection followed by rank-based feature selection methods. The selected subset of genes is evaluated using parallel classification algorithms. The accuracy values obtained are compared with existing rank-weight feature selection, parallelized recursive feature selection methods and also with the values obtained by executing parallelized HFS on DistributedWekaSpark. RESULTS: The classification accuracy obtained with the proposed parallelized HFS method is 97% and 79% for gastric cancer and childhood leukemia respectively. The proposed parallelized HFS method produced ~ 4% to ~ 15% improvement in classification accuracy when compared with previous methods. CONCLUSION: The results reveal the fact that the proposed parallelized feature selection algorithm is scalable to growing medical data and predicts cancer sub-types in lesser time with higher accuracy.","['Venkataramana, Lokeswari', 'Jacob, Shomona Gracia', 'Ramadoss, Rajavel', 'Saisuma, Dodda', 'Haritha, Dommaraju', 'Manoja, Kunthipuram']","['Venkataramana L', 'Jacob SG', 'Ramadoss R', 'Saisuma D', 'Haritha D', 'Manoja K']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2331-4507'],"['Department of CSE, Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Kalavakkam, Chennai, India. lokeswaricts@gmail.com.', ', Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of ECE, Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Kalavakkam, Chennai, India.', 'Department of CSE, Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Kalavakkam, Chennai, India.', 'Department of CSE, Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Kalavakkam, Chennai, India.', 'Department of CSE, Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering, Kalavakkam, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190819,Korea (South),Genes Genomics,Genes & genomics,101481027,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Correlation feature subset selection', '*DistributedWekaSpark', '*Parallel classification', '*Parallelized hybrid feature selection', '*Rank-based methods', '*Spark']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13258-019-00859-x [doi]', '10.1007/s13258-019-00859-x [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Genomics. 2019 Nov;41(11):1301-1313. doi: 10.1007/s13258-019-00859-x.

We first checked the phosphorylation status of YAP and found that it was constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine 357 in CML-derived cell lines (TCC-S and K562) but not in AML-derived cell lines (HL-60 and KG-1a). Treatment with imatinib or RK-20449 inhibited cell growth and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of YAP in both CML lines. Expression of Survivin or Cyclin D1 was decreased in TCC-S, but not in either HL-60 or KG-1a. Furthermore, we established BCR-ABL stable transfectant and control empty vector transfectant from TF-1, a factor-dependent human erythroleukemia cell line, to verify our results obtained with CML cell lines. YAP was phosphorylated at Y357 constitutively in BCR-ABL stable transfectant but not in control transfectant, and treatment with imatinib or RK-20449, a Src family kinase-specific inhibitor, inhibited cell growth, YAP tyrosine phosphorylation, and expression of Cyclin D1 in BCR-ABL stable transfectant. These results suggest that BCR-ABL induces tyrosine phosphorylation of YAP presumably through Src family kinases, which results in expression of Survivin and Cyclin D leading to leukemogenesis in CML cells.","['Moriyama, Kenta', 'Hori, Toshiyuki']","['Moriyama K', 'Hori T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4339-1406'],"['Biomedical Sciences Course, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Ritsumeikan University, Noji-Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga, 525-8577, Japan.', 'Biomedical Sciences Course, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Ritsumeikan University, Noji-Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga, 525-8577, Japan. toshihor@sk.ritsumei.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190819,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Src family kinase', 'Tyrosine phosphorylation', 'Yes-associated protein']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02726-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02726-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Nov;110(5):591-598. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02726-7.

One possible cause of this discrepancy is the existence of aberrant RNA modification landscapes in the so-called epitranscriptome. Here, we report that human glioma cells undergo DNA methylation-associated epigenetic silencing of NSUN5, a candidate RNA methyltransferase for 5-methylcytosine. In this setting, NSUN5 exhibits tumor-suppressor characteristics in vivo glioma models. We also found that NSUN5 loss generates an unmethylated status at the C3782 position of 28S rRNA that drives an overall depletion of protein synthesis, and leads to the emergence of an adaptive translational program for survival under conditions of cellular stress. Interestingly, NSUN5 epigenetic inactivation also renders these gliomas sensitive to bioactivatable substrates of the stress-related enzyme NQO1. Most importantly, NSUN5 epigenetic inactivation is a hallmark of glioma patients with long-term survival for this otherwise devastating disease.","['Janin, Maxime', 'Ortiz-Barahona, Vanessa', 'de

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most significant and life-threatening side effect. This individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is to investigate the association of severe CRS with CAR-T dose and baseline factors. METHODS: We collected the individual patient-level data of 237 patients with NHL or ALL from 16 published papers. A logistic model was used to analyze the association of severe CRS incidence with CAR-T dose and baseline factors including age and baseline tumor burden. A generalized additive model (GAM) with logit link function was used to estimate the nonlinear response for severe CRS incidence with CAR-T dose and baseline factors. RESULTS: Severe CRS incidence was positively associated with current proposed CAR-T treatment infusion dose at a range of 0.2 x 10(6)-5.0 x 10(6) T cells per kg of body weight in patients less than or equal to 25 years old. For patients over 25 years old the association was not significant. Significant association between severe CRS incidence and baseline tumor burden was also shown in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel insights that association between CAR-T treatment dose and severe CRS incidence only exists in patients less than or equal to 25 years old. Severe CRS incidence is associated with baseline tumor burden which indicates that tumor burden needs to be controlled with induced chemotherapy before CAR-T treatment.,"['Li, Jie', 'Wu, Zhenyu', 'Zhao, Naiqing']","['Li J', 'Wu Z', 'Zhao N']",,"['Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Ministry of Health (Fudan University), Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. zyw@fudan.edu.cn.', 'Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Ministry of Health (Fudan University), Shanghai, China. zyw@fudan.edu.cn.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. nqzhao1954@163.com.', 'Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Ministry of Health (Fudan University), Shanghai, China. nqzhao1954@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Not determined yet/Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Ministry of Health', '(Fudan University)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20190819,United States,Adv Ther,Advances in therapy,8611864,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Chimeric antigen receptor T cell', '*Generalized additive model', '*Individual patient data meta-analysis']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/06/19 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12325-019-01056-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12325-019-01056-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Adv Ther. 2019 Oct;36(10):2881-2894. doi: 10.1007/s12325-019-01056-8.

Global alterations in the epigenetic landscape are prevalent in malignant cells across different solid tumors including, prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and in haemopoietic malignancy. In particular, DNA hypomethylation and histone hypoacetylation have been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient blasts, with histone methylation being an emerging area of study. Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) is a post-translational modification known to be involved in the regulation of a broad range of biological processes, including the formation of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Following the observation of its aberrant methylation status in hematological malignancy and several other cancer phenotypes, recent studies have associated H3K9me3 levels with patient outcome and highlighted key molecular mechanisms linking H3K9me3 profile with AML etiology in a number of large-scale meta-analysis. Consequently, the development and application of small molecule inhibitors which target the histone methyltransferases or demethylase enzymes known to participate in the oncogenic regulation of H3K9me3 in AML represents an advancing area of ongoing study. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on how this particular epigenetic mark is regulated within cells and its emerging role as a potential therapeutic target in AML, along with an update on the current research into advancing the generation of more potent and selective inhibitors against known H3K9 methyltransferases and demethylases.","['Monaghan, Laura', 'Massett, Matthew E', 'Bunschoten, Roderick P', 'Hoose, Alex', 'Pirvan, Petrisor-Alin', 'Liskamp, Robert M J', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Huang, Xu']","['Monaghan L', 'Massett ME', 'Bunschoten RP', 'Hoose A', 'Pirvan PA', 'Liskamp RMJ', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Huang X']",,"[""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."", ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."", 'School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."", ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CGA/19/63/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_18048/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190802,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6687838,['NOTNLM'],"['Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)', 'Leukaemic stem cell (LSC)', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'gene suppression', 'heterochromatin', 'lysine specific demethylase (KDM)']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/08/21 06:01,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00705 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Aug 2;9:705. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00705. eCollection 2019.,,705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a few longitudinal studies exist and no randomized comparisons between two TKIs have been reported. Therefore, we prospectively analyzed the immune system of newly diagnosed CML patients treated with imatinib (n = 20) or bosutinib (n = 13), that participated in the randomized BFORE trial (NCT02130557). Comprehensive immunophenotyping, plasma protein profiling, and functional assays to determine activation levels of T and NK cells were performed at diagnosis, 3, and 12 months after therapy start. All results were correlated with clinical parameters such as Sokal risk and BCR-ABL load measured according to IS%. At diagnosis, low Sokal risk CML patients had a higher frequency of cytotoxic cells (CD8 + T and NK cells), increased cytotoxic potential of NK cells and lower frequency of naive and central memory CD4 + T cells. Further, soluble plasma protein profile divided patients into two distinct clusters with different disease burden at diagnosis. During treatment, BCR-ABL IS% correlated with immunological parameters such as plasma proteins, together with different memory subsets of CD4+ and CD8 + T cells. Interestingly, the proportion and cytotoxic potential of NK cells together with several soluble proteins increased during imatinib treatment. In contrast, no major immunological changes were observed during bosutinib treatment. In conclusion, imatinib and bosutinib were shown to have differential effects on the immune system in this randomized clinical trial. Increased number and function of NK cells were especially observed during imatinib therapy.","['Kreutzman, Anna', 'Yadav, Bhagwan', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Hee Lee, Moon', 'Janssen, Jeroen', 'Kasanen, Tiina', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Stentoft, Jesper', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Soderlund, Stina', 'Udby, Lene', 'Richter, Johan', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Kreutzman A', 'Yadav B', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Hee Lee M', 'Janssen J', 'Kasanen T', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Lotfi K', 'Markevarn B', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Stentoft J', 'Stenke L', 'Soderlund S', 'Udby L', 'Richter J', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Mustjoki S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5587-8844', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0816-8241']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital and Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Department of Hematology, County Council of Ostergotland, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Umea University Hospital, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University and Hematology Section, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University and Hematology Section, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, St Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine (IKOM), Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190713,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6685516,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CML', '*Sokal', '*bosutinib', '*imatinib']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/08/21 06:01,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2019.1638210 [doi]', '1638210 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2019 Jul 13;8(9):e1638210. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2019.1638210. eCollection 2019.,20210203,e1638210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel immunotherapeutics with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cells is rapidly migrating to clinical applications. Targeted therapies with small molecule inhibitors against Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are playing a major role for treatment of patients with either treatment-naive or refractory/relapsed CLL.

However, how NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis and clinical features of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is still unknown. Here, in ALL patients' bone marrow, we investigated the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and expression of NLRP3 inflammasome related genes, NF-kappaB, NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, Caspase-1, and ASC. A total of 308 ALL patients and 300 healthy participants were included in this study. D allele and DD genotype under codominant model of NF-kappaB-94ins/del ATTG were showed as a protective factor in susceptibility of ALL. As for CARD8 (rs2043211), AT/TT genotype under dominant model and TT genotype under codominant model greatly increased the ALL susceptibility. We further studied the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome genetic polymorphisms and clinical relevance. The results showed that DD genotype of NF-kappaB-94 ins/del ATTG and AT/TT genotype of CARD8 (rs2043211) contributed to lower WBC count and T-cell immunophenotype, respectively. Moreover, we also found that AT and TT genotypes of CARD8 (rs2043211), GT and TT genotypes of IL-1beta (rs16944), and TT genotype of IL-18 (rs1946518) were associated with higher mRNA expression of NLRP3 inflammasome related genes and secretion of downstream cytokines.

ECOG PS (n = 1618) was investigated in frailty groups: frail (49%) and nonfrail (51%). Frail patients experienced worse progression-free and overall survival vs nonfrail patients. Prognostic assessment was improved when combining frailty and International Staging System stage (I/II vs III). Frail patients had a higher risk of developing grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events. Treatment effects observed in the FIRST trial were confirmed per frailty group and per frailty and ISS group. The use of this ECOG PS-containing frailty scale as a predictive measure of clinical outcomes in patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM is supported by data from the FIRST trial. This score, based on age, CCI, and ECOG PS, can be easily replicated and may help design future myeloma studies in frail or nonfrail elderly patients.","['Facon, Thierry', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Belch, Andrew', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Chen, Wen-Ming', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Zamagni, Elena', 'Rodriguez-Otero, Paula', 'Renwick, William', 'Rose, Christian', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Boyle, Eileen', 'Manier, Salomon', 'Attal, Michel', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Macro, Margaret', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Lorraine Chretien, Marie', 'Ludwig, Heinz', 'Guo, Shien', 'Sturniolo, Michael', 'Tinel, Antoine', 'Silvia Monzini, Mara', 'Costa, Bruno', 'Houck, Vanessa', 'Hulin, Cyrille', 'Yves Mary, Jean']","['Facon T', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Meuleman N', 'Belch A', 'Mohty M', 'Chen WM', 'Kim K', 'Zamagni E', 'Rodriguez-Otero P', 'Renwick W', 'Rose C', 'Tempescul A', 'Boyle E', 'Manier S', 'Attal M', 'Moreau P', 'Macro M', 'Leleu X', 'Lorraine Chretien M', 'Ludwig H', 'Guo S', 'Sturniolo M', 'Tinel A', 'Silvia Monzini M', 'Costa B', 'Houck V', 'Hulin C', 'Yves Mary J']",,"['Univ.Lille, CHU Lille, Service des Maladies du Sang, F-59000, Lille, France. thierry.facon@chru-lille.fr.', 'National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Sungkyunkwan University Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Western Health, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Hopital Saint Vincent de Paul Universite Catholique de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Brest, France.', 'National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'University Hospital Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Caen, France.', 'Hopital La Mileterie, Poitiers, France.', 'CHU de Dijon, Dijon, France.', 'Wilhelminen Hospital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Evidera, Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene International Sarl, Boudry, Switzerland.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene International Sarl, Boudry, Switzerland.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Bordeaux, France.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article']",20190819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC7214253,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0539-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0539-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):224-233. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0539-0.

Heteroclitic BCMA72-80 [YLMFLLRKI] peptide-encapsulated liposome or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles displayed uniform size distribution and increased peptide delivery to human dendritic cells, which enhanced induction of BCMA-specific CTL. Distinct from liposome-based nanoparticles, PLGA-based nanoparticles demonstrated a gradual increase in peptide uptake by antigen-presenting cells, and induced BCMA-specific CTL with higher anti-tumor activities (CD107a degranulation, CTL proliferation, and IFN-gamma/IL-2/TNF-alpha production) against primary CD138(+) tumor cells and MM cell lines. The improved functional activities were associated with increased Tetramer(+)/CD45RO(+) memory CTL, CD28 upregulation on Tetramer(+) CTL, and longer maintenance of central memory (CCR7(+) CD45RO(+)) CTL, with the highest anti-MM activity and less differentiation into effector memory (CCR7(-) CD45RO(+)) CTL. These results provide the framework for therapeutic application of PLGA-based BCMA immunogenic peptide delivery system, rather than free peptide, to enhance the induction of BCMA-specific CTL with poly-functional Th1-specific anti-MM activities. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of PLGA nanotechnology-based cancer vaccine to enhance BCMA-targeted immunotherapy against myeloma.","['Bae, Jooeun', 'Parayath, Neha', 'Ma, Wenxue', 'Amiji, Mansoor', 'Munshi, Nikhil', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Bae J', 'Parayath N', 'Ma W', 'Amiji M', 'Munshi N', 'Anderson KC']",,"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC7297141,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0540-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0540-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):210-223. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0540-7.

However, data of outcome in ALL is still scarce. The outcomes of 1234 adult patients with ALL in first complete remission (CR1) who underwent Allo-SCT between 2007 and 2016 were analyzed. Comparison was done between haploidentical donor (Haplo) (136 patients), matched unrelated donor (MUD 10/10) (809 patients), and mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD 9/10) (289 patients). Univariate analysis showed similar outcomes in Haplo, MUD, and MMUD, including OS, LFS, RI, NRM, AGVHD, and CGVHD. In multivariate analysis, Haplo was not associated with worse outcomes compared to MUD 10/10 and MMUD 9/10. Indeed, compared to Haplo, the hazard ratio (HR) for LFS, OS, RI, NRM, AGVHD, and CGVHD were 1.1 (p = 0.7), 0.9 (p = 0.4), 1.35 (p = 0.2), 0.7 (p = 0.2), 1.1 (p = 0.8), and 0.8 (p = 0.2) for MUD, respectively, and 1.1 (p = 0.8), 1.0 (p = 1.0), 1.2 (p = 0.3), 0.8 (p = 0.4), 1.2 (p = 0.3), and 0.9 (p = 0.6) for MMUD, respectively. In conclusion, outcomes of adult patients with ALL in CR1 receiving Haplo Allo-SCT are comparable to MUD or MMUD transplants. Haplo should be considered as a clinically relevant option for patients lacking a matched sibling donor.","['Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Peczynski, Christophe', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Itala-Remes, Maija', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Peric, Zinaida', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shem-Tov N', 'Peczynski C', 'Labopin M', 'Itala-Remes M', 'Blaise D', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Socie G', 'Kroger N', 'Mielke S', 'Afanasyev B', 'Chevallier P', 'Tischer J', 'Helbig G', 'Jindra P', 'Peric Z', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5684-9447', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2114-7533']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. noga.shemtov@sheba.health.gov.il.', 'Department of Hematology, EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Hospital St. Louis, Department of Hematology-BMT, Paris, France.', 'University Hospital Eppendorf, Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'First State Pavlov Medical University of St. Petersburg, Raisa Gorbacheva Memorial Research Institute for Paediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Transplantation, St. Petersburg, Russia.', ""CHU Nantes, Departement D'Hematologie, Nantes, France."", 'Klinikum Grosshadern, Med.

Herein, we investigated the functional significance of the oncogenic lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) in MM. Our study demonstrates that NEAT1 expression level is higher in MM than in the majority of hematological malignancies. NEAT1 silencing by novel LNA-gapmeR antisense oligonucleotide inhibits MM cell proliferation and triggers apoptosis in vitro and in vivo murine MM model as well. By transcriptome analyses, we found that NEAT1 targeting downregulates genes involved in DNA repair processes including the Homologous Recombination pathway, which in turn results in massive DNA damage. These findings may explain the synergistic impact on apoptosis observed in MM cell lines co-treated with inhibitors of both NEAT1 and PARP. The translational significance of NEAT1 targeting is further underlined by its synergistic effects with the most common drugs administered for MM treatment, including bortezomib, carfilzomib, and melphalan. Overall, NEAT1 silencing is associated with a chemo-sensitizing effect of both conventional and novel therapies, and its targeting could therefore represent a promising strategy for novel anti-MM therapeutic options.","['Taiana, Elisa', 'Favasuli, Vanessa', 'Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Pelizzoni, Francesca', 'Manzoni, Martina', 'Barbieri, Marzia', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Silvestris, Ilaria', 'Gallo Cantafio, Maria Eugenia', 'Platonova, Natalia', 'Zuccala, Valeria', 'Maltese, Lorenza', 'Soncini, Debora', 'Ruberti, Samantha', 'Cea, Michele', 'Chiaramonte, Raffaella', 'Amodio, Nicola', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Taiana E', 'Favasuli V', 'Ronchetti D', 'Todoerti K', 'Pelizzoni F', 'Manzoni M', 'Barbieri M', 'Fabris S', 'Silvestris I', 'Gallo Cantafio ME', 'Platonova N', 'Zuccala V', 'Maltese L', 'Soncini D', 'Ruberti S', 'Cea M', 'Chiaramonte R', 'Amodio N', 'Tassone P', 'Agnelli L', 'Neri A']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3345-0799', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0582-6170']","['Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, DiMI, University of Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, DiMI, University of Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, DiMI, University of Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. antonino.neri@unimi.it.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy. antonino.neri@unimi.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0542-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0542-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):234-244. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0542-5.

There are great public concerns about its impact on health care with anticipation of rising cancer incidences. We examined the incidences and deaths of leukemia and overall cancer in the U.S. from 1998 to 2018. The acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) incidences remained constant prior to 2011 but have climbed up substantially since then, and the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) incidence has increased continuously since 1998. The significant increase of myeloid leukemia and CLL incidences was strongly correlated with the U.S. population aging. The incidence of all cancers was increased in correlation with a small increase in aging population prior to 2011, but surprisingly has changed marginally since 2011, which was not significantly correlated with the accelerated population aging. We observed the most substantial decline of deaths with CML, whereas AML deaths continued to rise in the past 20 years. In conclusion, the overall cancer incidence was not increased as fast as previously feared with aging Americans; however, the incidences of myeloid leukemia and CLL significantly outpaced that of all cancers.","['Hao, Taisen', 'Li-Talley, Min', 'Buck, Alison', 'Chen, WenYong']","['Hao T', 'Li-Talley M', 'Buck A', 'Chen W']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5213-3428'],"['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Biola University, La Mirada, CA, 90638, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA. wechen@coh.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH2 CA213385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 CA213385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190819,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6700310,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-48445-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-48445-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 19;9(1):12070. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-48445-1.,20201021,12070,,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/pathology', '*Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', 'Population Growth', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring of CML patients during treatment is essential, not only for tailoring the treatment but also to detect early relapse to enable timely intervention. Commonly used methods for detection of residual disease are conventional karyotyping, FISH and molecular methods. In this study, we compared FISH with QRT-PCR for detection of residual disease in CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CML patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and on regular follow up at University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC) were selected. A comparative study was conducted between FISH and QRT-PCR for BCR-ABL transcripts at diagnosis and during follow-up. RESULTS: There was good correlation between FISH and QRT-PCR for BCR-ABL. At 6th month of follow-up post diagnosis, FISH had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 65.2% (k >0.339, p<0.033). At 12th month, the sensitivity of FISH was 83% and the specificity was 59.1% (k >0.286, p <0.065). Similarly, at the 24th month, FISH had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 68.8% (k >0.642, p<0.000). DISCUSSION: Early achievement of major molecular response (MMR) and complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) were reliable predictors of long-term maintenance of molecular remission.","['Haidary, A M', 'Azma, R Z', 'Ithnin, A', 'Alauddin, H', 'Tumian, N R', 'Tamil, A M', 'Razak, N F A', 'Abu Amis, S H', 'Zin, N M', 'Shuib, S']","['Haidary AM', 'Azma RZ', 'Ithnin A', 'Alauddin H', 'Tumian NR', 'Tamil AM', 'Razak NFA', 'Abu Amis SH', 'Zin NM', 'Shuib S']",,"['Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. zahratul@ppukm.ukm.edu.my.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/02/01 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2019 Aug;41(2):149-160.,20200131,149-160,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of such mutations using next-generation sequencing data requires a computationally intensive read mapping step followed by several variant calling methods. Targeted mutation identification drastically shifts the usual tradeoff between accuracy and performance by concentrating all computations over a small portion of sequence space. Here, we present km, an efficient approach leveraging k-mer decomposition of reads to identify targeted mutations. Our approach is versatile, as it can detect single-base mutations, several types of insertions and deletions, as well as fusions. We used two independent cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas and Leucegene) to show that mutation detection by km is fast, accurate, and mainly limited by sequencing depth. Therefore, km allows the establishment of fast diagnostics from next-generation sequencing data and could be suitable for clinical applications.","['Audemard, Eric Olivier', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Feghaly, Albert', 'Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Lemieux, Sebastien']","['Audemard EO', 'Gendron P', 'Feghaly A', 'Lavallee VP', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G', 'Lemieux S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1661-896X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9829-2600', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7929-415X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5477-1386']","['The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada s.lemieux@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190819,United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,PMC6701478,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['2/4/e201900336 [pii]', '10.26508/lsa.201900336 [doi]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2019 Aug 19;2(4). pii: 2/4/e201900336. doi: 10.26508/lsa.201900336.

We report our comprehensive experience using TLI-ATG conditioning in 612 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allogeneic transplantation at Stanford University from 2001 to 2016. All patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood grafts and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. The median age was 60 years (range, 21-78), with a median follow-up of 6.0 years (range, 1.0-16.4). Common diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 193), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 94), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 80), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 175), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL; n = 35). Thirty-four percent of patients had a comorbidity index >/=3, 30% had a high to very high disease risk index, and 56% received unrelated donor grafts, including 15% with HLA-mismatched donors. Ninety-eight percent underwent transplant in the outpatient setting, and 57% were never hospitalized from days 0 through 100. The 1-year rates of nonrelapse mortality (NRM), grade II-IV acute GVHD, and extensive chronic GVHD were 9%, 14%, and 22%, respectively. The 4-year estimates for overall and progression-free survival were 42% and 32% for AML, 30% and 21% for MDS, 67% and 43% for CLL, 68% and 45% for NHL, and 78% and 49% for HL. Mixed chimerism correlated with the risk of relapse. TLI-ATG conditioning was well tolerated, with low rates of GVHD and NRM. Durable remissions were observed across hematologic malignancies, with particularly favorable outcomes for heavily pretreated lymphomas. Several efforts are underway to augment donor chimerism and reduce relapse rates while maintaining the favorable safety and tolerability profile of this regimen.","['Spinner, Michael A', 'Kennedy, Vanessa E', 'Tamaresis, John S', 'Lavori, Philip W', 'Arai, Sally', 'Johnston, Laura J', 'Meyer, Everett H', 'Miklos, David B', 'Muffly, Lori S', 'Negrin, Robert S', 'Rezvani, Andrew R', 'Shizuru, Judith A', 'Weng, Wen-Kai', 'Hoppe, Richard T', 'Strober, Samuel', 'Lowsky, Robert']","['Spinner MA', 'Kennedy VE', 'Tamaresis JS', 'Lavori PW', 'Arai S', 'Johnston LJ', 'Meyer EH', 'Miklos DB', 'Muffly LS', 'Negrin RS', 'Rezvani AR', 'Shizuru JA', 'Weng WK', 'Hoppe RT', 'Strober S', 'Lowsky R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1912-4076', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1993-4172', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9887-6136', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1765-2326']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, and.', 'Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.']",['eng'],['P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6712526,,,2019/08/21 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000297 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000297 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Aug 27;3(16):2454-2464. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000297.,20200817,2454-2464,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Lymphatic Irradiation/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical testing demonstrated potent oncolytic activity of ACAM2000 against several tumor types. This Phase I clinical trial of ACAM2000 delivered by autologous adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells was conducted to determine the safety and feasibility of such a treatment in patients with advanced solid tumors or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Twenty-four patients with solid tumors and two patients with AML participated in this open-label, non-randomized dose-escalation trial. All patients were treated with SVF derived from autologous fat and incubated for 15 min to 1 h with ACAM2000 before application. Six patients received systemic intravenous application only, one patient received intra-tumoral application only, 15 patients received combination intravenous with intra-tumoral deployment, 3 patients received intravenous and intra-peritoneal injection and 1 patient received intravenous, intra-tumoral and intra-peritoneal injections. Safety at each dose level of ACAM2000 (1.4 x 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU) to 1.8 x 10(7) PFU) was evaluated. Blood samples for PK assessments, flow cytometry and cytokine analysis were collected at baseline and 1 min, 1 h, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months following treatment. RESULTS: No serious toxicities (> grade 2) were reported. Seven patients reported an adverse event (AE) in this study: self-limiting skin rashes, lasting 7 to 18 days-an expected adverse reaction to ACAM2000. No AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported. Viral DNA was detected in all patients' blood samples immediately following treatment. Interestingly, in 8 patients viral DNA disappeared 1 day and re-appeared 1 week post treatment, suggesting active viral replication at tumor sites, and correlating with longer survival of these patients. No major increase in cytokine levels or correlation between cytokine levels and skin rashes was noted. We were able to assess some initial efficacy signals, especially when the ACAM2000/SVF treatment was combined with checkpoint inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ACAM2000/SVF in patients with advanced solid tumors or AML is safe and well tolerated, and several patients had signals of an anticancer effect. These promising initial clinical results merit further investigation of therapeutic utility.

The diagnosis of CNS SLL is challenging due to its variable clinical and radiological features, which may overlap with those of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Primary CNS SLL differs from DLBCL in that it has an indolent clinical course and a good prognosis. Thus, it is important to distinguish SLL from DLBCL. By reviewing the literature, only two cases of low-grade SLL, primarily located in the CNS and involving the brain parenchyma and dura, have been reported. To our knowledge, primary CNS SLL in the bilateral ventricles has never been reported. Interestingly, the two cases in our report are identical in terms of the clinical presentations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, pathological results and prognoses. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients presented with headaches. MRI suggested solid lesions located in the bilateral ventricles that were isointense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images. After the injection of contrast agent (gadolinium, Gd), the intraventricular lesions were homogeneously enhanced and hyperperfused. CSF cytology revealed malignant cells. Brain biopsy revealed diffuse proliferation of small lymphocytes with positive labelling of B-cell immunomarkers. The primary origin in the CNS was confirmed with no evidence of systemic lymphoma. Two patients were given high doses of methotrexate-based chemotherapy and were free from symptoms and progression for more than 1-year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of homogeneously enhanced intraventricular MRI lesions should raise the suspicion of primary CNS SLL.","['Guo, Rongjing', 'Zhang, Xiaolong', 'Niu, Chunxiao', 'Xi, Yibin', 'Yin, Hong', 'Lin, Hong', 'Chang, Ting']","['Guo R', 'Zhang X', 'Niu C', 'Xi Y', 'Yin H', 'Lin H', 'Chang T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7546-8017'],"[""Department of Neurology, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, 569 Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurology, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, 569 Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurology, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, 569 Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiology, Xijing Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiology, Xijing Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurology, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, 569 Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurology, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, 569 Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, 710038, People's Republic of China. changting1981@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['81671233/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016LCYJ006/the Innovation and Development Fund of Tangdu hospital']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190819,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,PMC6699128,['NOTNLM'],"['Bilateral ventricular neoplasm', 'Central nervous system', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'Small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12883-019-1430-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12883-019-1430-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2019 Aug 19;19(1):200. doi: 10.1186/s12883-019-1430-3.,20191125,200,,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cerebral Ventricles/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Medicine and pharmaceutical chemistry need and consider it a huge goal to define target proteins of new antiretroviral compounds. ChEMBL manages Big Data features with a complex data set, which is hard to organize. This makes information difficult to analyze due to a big number of characteristics described in order to predict new drug candidates for retroviral infections. For this reason, we propose to develop a new predictive model combining perturbation theory (PT) bases and machine learning (ML) modeling to create a new tool that can take advantage of all the available information. The PTML model proposed in this work for the ChEMBL data set preclinical experimental assays for antiretroviral compounds consists of a linear equation with four variables. The PT operators used are founded on multicondition moving averages, combining different features and simplifying the difficulty to manage all data. More than 140000 preclinical assays for 56105 compounds with different characteristics or experimental conditions have been carried out and can be found in ChEMBL database, covering combinations with 359 biological activity parameters (c0), 55 protein accessions (c1), 83 cell lines (c2), 64 organisms of assay (c3), and 773 subtypes or strains. We have included 150148 preclinical experimental assays for HIV virus, 1188 for HTLV virus, 84 for simian immunodeficiency virus, 370 for murine leukemia virus, 119 for Rous sarcoma virus, 1581 for MMTV, etc. We also included 5277 assays for hepatitis B virus. The developed PTML model reached considerable values in sensibility (73.05% for training and 73.10% for validation), specificity (86.61% for training and 87.17% for validation), and accuracy (75.84% for training and 75.98% for validation). We also compared alternative PTML models with different PT operators such as covariance, moments, and exponential terms. Finally, we made a comparison between literature ML models with our PTML model and also artificial neural network (ANN) nonlinear models. We conclude that this PTML model is the first one to consider multiple characteristics of preclinical experimental antiretroviral assays combined, generating a simple, useful, and adaptable instrument, which could reduce time and costs in antiretroviral drugs research.","['Vasquez-Dominguez, Emilia', 'Armijos-Jaramillo, Vinicio Danilo', 'Tejera, Eduardo', 'Gonzalez-Diaz, Humbert']","['Vasquez-Dominguez E', 'Armijos-Jaramillo VD', 'Tejera E', 'Gonzalez-Diaz H']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0737-2977', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9392-2797']","['Department of Organic Chemistry II , University of Basque Country UPV/EHU , 48940 Leioa , Spain.', 'Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences-Biotechnology , Universidad de Las Americas (UDLA) , 170125 Quito , Ecuador.', 'Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences-Biotechnology , Universidad de Las Americas (UDLA) , 170125 Quito , Ecuador.', 'Bio-chemioinformatics group , Universidad de Las Americas (UDLA) , 170125 Quito , Ecuador.', 'Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences-Biotechnology , Universidad de Las Americas (UDLA) , 170125 Quito , Ecuador.', 'Bio-chemioinformatics group , Universidad de Las Americas (UDLA) , 170125 Quito , Ecuador.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry II , University of Basque Country UPV/EHU , 48940 Leioa , Spain.', 'IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science , 48011 Bilbao , Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190830,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ChEMBL', '*antiretroviral compounds', '*big data', '*machine learning', '*perturbation theory']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00538 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2019 Oct 7;16(10):4200-4212. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00538.

The molecular structure of N-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxamide as a model compound was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All the analysed compounds were tested against the reference strain Staphylococcus aureus and three clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus as well as against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. kansasii. In addition, the inhibitory profile of photosynthetic electron transport in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts was specified. In vitro cytotoxicity of the most effective compounds was tested on the human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cell line. The activities of N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-, N-(3-fluoro-5-methoxy-phenyl)- and N-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carbox- amide were comparable with or even better than the commonly used standards ampicillin and isoniazid. All promising compounds did not show any cytotoxic effect at the concentration >30 microM. Moreover, an in silico evaluation of clogP features was performed for the entire set of the carboxamides using a range of software lipophilicity predictors, and cross-comparison with the experimentally determined lipophilicity (log k), in consensus lipophilicity estimation, was conducted as well. Principal component analysis was employed to illustrate noticeable variations with respect to the molecular lipophilicity (theoretical/experimental) and rule-of-five violations. Additionally, ligand-oriented studies for the assessment of the three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship profile were carried out with the comparative molecular surface analysis to determine electron and/or steric factors that potentially contribute to the biological activities of the investigated compounds.","['Michnova, Hana', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Gonec, Tomas',

However, the development of CAR-T cells against solid tumors lags behind. Here we present the clinical-scale production of CAR-T cells for the treatment of melanoma under full GMP compliance. In this approach a CAR, specific for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is intentionally transiently expressed by mRNA electroporation for safety reasons. The clinical-scale protocol was optimized for: (i) expansion of T cells, (ii) electroporation efficiency, (iii) viability, (iv) cryopreservation, and (v) potency. Four consistency runs resulted in CAR-T cells in clinically sufficient numbers, i.e., 2.4 x 10(9) CAR-expressing T cells, starting from 1.77x10(8) PBMCs, with an average expansion of 13.6x, an electroporation efficiency of 88.0% CAR-positive cells, a survival of 74.1% after electroporation, and a viability of 84% after cryopreservation. Purity was 98.7% CD3(+) cells, with 78.1% CD3(+)/CD8(+) T cells and with minor contaminations of 1.2% NK cells and 0.6% B cells. The resulting CAR-T cells were tested for cytolytic activity after cryopreservation and showed antigen-specific and very efficient lysis of tumor cells. Although our work is descriptive rather than investigative in nature, we expect that providing this clinically applicable protocol to generate sufficient numbers of mRNA-transfected CAR-T cells will help in moving the field of adoptive cell therapy of cancer forward.","['Wiesinger, Manuel', 'Marz, Johannes', 'Kummer, Mirko', 'Schuler, Gerold', 'Dorrie, Jan', 'Schuler-Thurner, Beatrice', 'Schaft, Niels']","['Wiesinger M', 'Marz J', 'Kummer M', 'Schuler G', 'Dorrie J', 'Schuler-Thurner B', 'Schaft N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3478-0741', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8653-5425', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8236-9298']","['Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany. niels.schaft@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],['SCHA 1247/3-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'],['Journal Article'],20190816,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC6721485,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T cell', 'CSPG4', 'clinical scale production', 'clinical study', 'consistency runs', 'full GMP compliance', 'melanoma']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/08/21 06:01,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11081198 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11081198 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Aug 16;11(8). pii: cancers11081198. doi: 10.3390/cancers11081198.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although care and support services are available that cater for opportunistic infections related to HIV, the main focus is narrow and predominantly aimed at tuberculosis. We aimed to estimate the burden of serious fungal infections in Namibia, currently unknown, based on the size of the population at risk and available epidemiological data. Data were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and published reports. When no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate the frequencies of fungal infections, using the previously described methodology. The population of Namibia in 2011 was estimated at 2,459,000 and 37% were children. Among approximately 516,390 adult women, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (>/=4 episodes /year) is estimated to occur in 37,390 (3003/100,000 females). Using a low international average rate of 5/100,000, we estimated 125 cases of candidemia, and 19 patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis. Among survivors of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in Namibia 2017, 112 new cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) are likely, a prevalence of 354 post-TB and a total prevalence estimate of 453 CPA patients in all. Asthma affects 11.2% of adults, 178,483 people, and so allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) were estimated in approximately 179/100,000 and 237/100,000 people, respectively. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is estimated to affect 15 patients following leukaemia therapy, and an estimated 0.13% patients admitted to hospital with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (259) and 4% of HIV-related deaths (108) - a total of 383 people. The total HIV-infected population is estimated at 200,000, with 32,371 not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among HIV-infected patients, 543 cases of cryptococcal meningitis and 836 cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia are estimated each year. Tinea capitis infections were estimated at 53,784 cases, and mucormycosis at five cases. Data were missing for fungal keratitis and skin neglected fungal tropical diseases such as mycetoma. The present study indicates that approximately 5% of the Namibian population is affected by fungal infections. This study is not an epidemiological study-it illustrates estimates based on assumptions derived from similar studies. The estimates are incomplete and need further epidemiological and diagnostic studies to corroborate, amend them, and improve the diagnosis and management of these diseases.","['Dunaiski, Cara M', 'Denning, David W']","['Dunaiski CM', 'Denning DW']",,"['Department of Health and Applied Sciences, Namibia University of Science and Technology, 13 Jackson Kaujeua Street, Windhoek 9000, Namibia. cdunaiski@nust.na.', 'National Aspergillosis Centre, Wythenshawe Hospital and the University of Manchester, Manchester M23 9LT, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190816,Switzerland,J Fungi (Basel),"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",101671827,PMC6787647,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV/AIDS', 'Namibia', 'fungal infections', 'opportunistic infections', 'pulmonary infections']",2019/08/21 06:00,2019/08/21 06:01,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:01 [medline]']","['jof5030075 [pii]', '10.3390/jof5030075 [doi]']",epublish,J Fungi (Basel). 2019 Aug 16;5(3). pii: jof5030075. doi: 10.3390/jof5030075.,,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of HOXA genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been comprehensively studied. We compared the transcriptional expression, survival data, and network analysis of HOXA-associated signaling pathways in patients with AML using the ONCOMINE, GEPIA, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, and Metascape databases. We observed that HOXA2-10 mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in AML and that high HOXA1-10 expression was associated with poor AML patient prognosis. The HOXA genes were altered in ~18% of the AML samples, either in terms of amplification, deep deletion, or elevated mRNA expression. The following pathways were modulated by HOXA gene upregulation: GO:0048706: embryonic skeletal system development; R-HSA-5617472: activation of HOX genes in anterior hindbrain development during early embryogenesis; GO:0060216: definitive hemopoiesis; hsa05202: transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer; and GO:0045638: negative regulation of myeloid cell differentiation, and they were significantly regulated due to alterations affecting the HOXA genes. This study identified HOXA3-10 genes as potential AML therapeutic targets and prognostic markers.","['Chen, Si-Liang', 'Qin, Zhe-Yuan', 'Hu, Fang', 'Wang, Yun', 'Dai, Yu-Jun', 'Liang, Yang']","['Chen SL', 'Qin ZY', 'Hu F', 'Wang Y', 'Dai YJ', 'Liang Y']",,"['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China. liangyang@sysucc.org.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China. liangyang@sysucc.org.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China. liangyang@sysucc.org.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190816,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC6723066,['NOTNLM'],"['*HOXA gene family', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*bioinformatics integration analysis', '*molecular functions', '*prognostic value', '*transcription factor']",2019/08/21 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/08/21 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['genes10080621 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10080621 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Aug 16;10(8). pii: genes10080621. doi: 10.3390/genes10080621.,20200109,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rhombencephalon/embryology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes, hypodiploidy is ""masked"" and patients do not have a karyotypically visible clone with </=43 chromosomes. Instead, their abnormal karyotypes contain 50-78 or more chromosomes from doubling of previously hypodiploid cells. When the hypodiploid and doubled hyperdiploid clones are both present, patients can be identified by traditional test methods [karyotype, DNA Index (DI), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)], but the incidence of masked hypodiploid cases in which only the doubled clone is visible is unknown. We analyzed 7013 patients with B-ALL enrolled in COG AALL03B1 (2003-2011) for whom chromosome studies were available. Of 115 patients with hypodiploidy (25-39 chromosomes), karyotypes of 40 showed only the hypodiploid clone, 47 showed mosaicism with both hypodiploid and hyperdiploid (doubled) karyotypes, and 28 with masked hypodiploidy showed only a hyperdiploid (doubled) clone. Unique karyotypic signatures were identified, and widespread loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was seen in the microsatellite panel for all patients with masked hypodiploidy. An increased awareness of the unusual karyotypic profile associated with a doubled hypodiploid clone and coordinated use of DI, FISH, and LOH studies when indicated can identify patients with masked hypodiploidy and allow appropriate treatment selection.","['Carroll, Andrew J', 'Shago, Mary', 'Mikhail, Fady M', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie', 'Stonerock, Eileen', 'Ell, Denise', 'Kahwash, Samir', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Chen, I-Ming L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Rao, Kathleen W', 'Heerema, Nyla A']","['Carroll AJ', 'Shago M', 'Mikhail FM', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Loh ML', 'Raetz EA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood BL', 'Maloney KW', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Larsen EC', 'Gastier-Foster J', 'Stonerock E', 'Ell D', 'Kahwash S', 'Devidas M', 'Harvey RC', 'Chen IL', 'Willman CL', 'Hunger SP', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Rao KW', 'Heerema NA']",,"['Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.

Although previous studies revealed some potential impact of CCA/Ph- on CML patients' outcome, clinical significance of CCA/Ph- in CML patients remains to be further elucidated. We retrospectively reviewed the patients with CML evaluated at Genoptix Medical Laboratory in Carlsbad, California from 2005 to 2015. Twenty-four CML patients with CCA/Ph- cells were identified. These include 18 patients with single chromosomal abnormality, 4 patients with double chromosomal abnormalities, and two patients with complex cytogenetic abnormalities. In addition to trisomy 8 and monosomy 7, we identified that 20q- was also a common abnormality in CCA/Ph- cells. Most of the patients with CCA/Ph- cells demonstrated no significant dysplasia or increased blasts with two exceptions: one patient with persistent 7q- exhibiting mild dysmegakaryopoiesis, suggestive of an early evolving myelodysplastic syndrome, and another patient with complex cytogenetic abnormalities who developed acute myeloid leukemia after gained MLL amplification. One patient with complex cytogenetic abnormalities showed optimal response to TKI treatment, no overt dysplasia, and no disease progression during almost 4-years of follow-up. More interestingly, FISH tests could identify more cases with double chromosomal abnormalities and these cases showed suboptimal responses to TKI treatments. Our observation indicates that 20q- was also a common abnormality in CCA/Ph- cells, further FISH tests revealed additional CCA/Ph-, and the majority of CML patients with two or more chromosomal abnormalities in Ph- cells showed inferior response to TKI treatments. The results of our study suggest that CML cases with CCA/Ph- may represent a group of patients with heterogeneous genetic alterations.","['Ni, Hongyu', 'Sun, Xinlai', 'Xu, Yin', 'Lyle, Derek', 'Petersen, Paris', 'Zhao, Xianfeng', 'Drum, Hong', 'You, Bei', 'Liu, Dongfang', 'Liu, Chen', 'Jiang, Jie-Gen']","['Ni H', 'Sun X', 'Xu Y', 'Lyle D', 'Petersen P', 'Zhao X', 'Drum H', 'You B', 'Liu D', 'Liu C', 'Jiang JG']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Illinois at Chicago, 840 S.

Cytogenetic analyses revealed a complex karyotype, characterized by rearrangements in chromosomes 1, 5, 17, 20, an additional unidentified marker chromosome, and apparent amplification of chromosome 21. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected deletions of CKS1B, EGR1, TP53, and apparent amplification of RUNX1 (6-8 signals). Array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) detected amplification of the 5' non-coding region of RUNX1 and deletion of the 3' coding region of RUNX1.

Although most patients with CMML show clonal genetic aberrations, there is no known cytogenetic or molecular genetic finding that is specific to CMML. We report a patient who had a clinical and morphological presentation consistent with CMML. The genetic work-up showed an ETV6-ABL1 fusion consequent to a 9;12 translocation, and a missense mutation in SMC1A (c.1757G>A, p.Arg586Gln). The SMC1A mutations are recurrent, albeit rare, in myeloid malignancies, without an established clinical significance in CMML. ETV6-ABL1 fusion is a rare but recurrent genetic aberration found in various hematologic malignancies involving both the lymphoid and myeloid lineage, but to the best of our knowledge, CMML is an exceptionally rare presentation of ETV6-ABL1 rearranged neoplasm. ETV6-ABL1 fusion is often formed through complex rearrangements, and usually cryptic by routine G-banded chromosome analysis. The diseases associated with this rearrangement generally have an aggressive course, hence detecting or excluding this rearrangement during diagnostic work-up is critical for treatment planning.","['Cessna, Melissa H', 'Paulraj, Prabakaran', 'Hilton, Benjamin', 'Sadre-Bazzaz, Kianoush', 'Szankasi, Philippe', 'Cluff, Alice', 'Patel, Jay L', 'Hoda, Daanish', 'Toydemir, Reha M']","['Cessna MH', 'Paulraj P', 'Hilton B', 'Sadre-Bazzaz K', 'Szankasi P', 'Cluff A', 'Patel JL', 'Hoda D', 'Toydemir RM']",,"['Department of Pathology, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Intermountain Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.

Overexpression of certain proto-oncogenes plays an indispensable role in tumorigenesis and overexpression can be a consequence of gene rearrangement, amplification and/or mutation. Rearrangement and amplification of KMT2A located at chromosome band 11q23 is a well-characterized genetic driver in a subset of AML/MDS cases and is associated with a poor prognosis. The presence of homogeneously staining regions (hsr) also has been correlated with amplification of specific proto-oncogenes. In this study, we correlated hsr(11)(q23) with KMT2A in a large cohort of AML/MDS (n=54) patients. We identified 37 patients with hsr(11)(q23) in the setting of AML (n=27) and MDS (n=10). All patients showed a complex karyotype including 12 cases with monosomy 17. KMT2A FISH analysis was available for 35 patients which showed KMT2A amplification in all patients. Among control cases with hsr involving chromosomes other than 11q [non-11q hsr, n=17], FISH analysis for KMT2A was available in 10 cases and none of these cases showed KMT2A amplification (p=0.0001, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). Mutational analysis was performed in 32 patients with hsr(11)(q23). The most common mutated gene was TP53 (n=29), followed by DNMT3A (n=4), NF1 (n=4), and TET2 (n=3). Thirty (83%) patients died over a median follow-up of 7.6 months (range, 0.4-33.4). In summary, hsr(11)(q23) in AML/MDS cases is associated with a complex karyotype, monosomy 17, KMT2A amplification, and TP53 mutation.","['Sakhdari, Ali', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Huh, Yang O']","['Sakhdari A', 'Tang Z', 'Ok CY', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Huh YO']",,"['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030-4009, United States.

METHODS: Patients with de novo AML included were aged between 20 and 60 years. Cytogenetic analysis was done at diagnosis. Twenty cells were analyzed, although examination of lower numbers of metaphases was also acceptable if an abnormal clone was detected. FINDINGS: From 1/1/04 to 31/12/2014, among 1315 adult patients, 1055 (80%) patients were aged between 20 and 60 years. Karyotype was done in 927 (88%) patients and cytogenetic analysis failed in 32 cases (3.4%). Clonal abnormalities were observed in 520 (58%) patients. 175 (19.5%) were classified in the favorable group, 609 were in the intermediate group and 111 (12.5%) were in the adverse group. The most frequent chromosomal abnormality observed was t(8;21) in 112 (12.5%). Thirty three (3.7%) patients had t(15;17) and 30 (3.3%) had inv16, trisomy 8 was found in 47 (5.2%), 11q23 rearrangements in 32 (3.6%), 67 (7.4%) had a complex karyotype, -5/del(5q) and -7/del(7q) were seen in, respectively, 11(1%) and 27 (3%). Monosomy occurred in 115 (13%) patients, 70 (8%) responded to the definition of monosomal karyotypes. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest study done in Morocco, Africa and Middle East. Epidemiological studies involving different ethnic populations and geographic regions of the world should help unfold the true nature of environmental and genetic interplay in the development of AML. Our cytogenetic profile reveals some particularities when compared to other populations; it does not seem to be similar neither to eastern or western countries.","['Khoubila, Nisrine', 'Bendari, Mounia', 'Hda, Nezha', 'Lamchahab, Mouna', 'Qachouh, Meryem', 'Rachid, Mohamed', 'Quessar, Asmaa']","['Khoubila N', 'Bendari M', 'Hda N', 'Lamchahab M', 'Qachouh M', 'Rachid M', 'Quessar A']",,"['Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Unit, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, 20 August 1953 Hospital, 6, Rue Lahcen EL Arjoune, Casablanca 20000, Morocco; Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca.

We used Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research data and samples of 1840 adult patients with acute leukemia and their 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donors to investigate the impact of HLA-E matching status as well as of donor/recipient (D/R) HLA-E genotype on post-HSCT outcome. Both patients and donors were HLA-E genotyped by next-generation sequencing. All patients received their first transplant in complete remission between 2000 and 2015. Median follow-up time was 90 months. Overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), transplant-related mortality (TRM), and relapse incidence were primary endpoints with statistical significance set at .01. D/R HLA-E genotype analysis revealed a significant association of donor HLA-E*01:03/01:03 genotype with DFS (hazard ratio [HR]=1.35, P=.0006) and TRM (HR=1.41, P=.0058) in patients who received T cell replete (ie, without in vivo T cell depletion) transplants (n=1297). As for D/R HLA-E matching, we did not identify any significant effect on any of the clinical outcome endpoints.

There were 68 differentially expressed miRNAs in CD19(+)B lymphocytes obtained from 6 Uygur CLL patients, of which miR-1295, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-21 and miR-29c were the 5 most upregulated, and miR-181a, miR-126, miR-181b, miR-125a-5p and miR199b the 5 most downregulated miRNAs. miR-15a/miR-16-1 which might be important drivers of the disease, were not eliminated by profile screening. From the 68 differentially expressed miRNAs, 5 previously-reported CLL-related miRNAs were selected for further confirmation analyses, from which expression levels of miR-29b, miR-34a and miR-155 were found to be increased while miR-181a and miR-181b decreased. However, there were no differences in the expression levels of miR-15a/miR-16-1 between CLL patients and healthy donors, but the expression levels of miR-15a/miR-16-1 in CLL patients with a 13q deletion was depressed. In addition, there was no difference in the expression level of the above 7 miRNAs between 44 Han and 40 Uygur CLL patients. The expression levels of miR-29b, miR-181a and miR-181b correlated with IGVH mutations, while the expression levels of miR-34a, miR-29b and miR-181b correlated with a p53 abnormality in 84 Uygur and Han CLL patients. Taking p53 abnormality as the cut-off value criteria, low expression levels of miR-34a (cut-off value 4.65, P=0.02) and miR-29b (cut-off value 4.71, P=0.009) hinted at a poor treatment-free survival (TFS) prognosis for all CLL patients.

There is distinct need for novel basic, translational, and clinical research strategies to enhance design of preventive and therapeutic approaches for patients at risk for development of these lesions. The research modeling can be conceptually enhanced by extrapolating ""lessons learned"" from selected oral mucosal conditions in patients without cancer as well. This approach may permit determination of the extent to which pathobiology and clinical management are either similar to or uniquely distinct from oral mucosal lesions caused by targeted cancer therapies. Modeling associated with oral mucosal disease in non-oncology patients is thus presented in this context as well. This article addresses this emerging paradigm, with emphasis on current mechanistic modeling and clinical treatment. This approach is in turn designed to foster delineation of new research strategies, with the goal of enhancing cancer patient treatment in the future.","['Carrozzo, M', 'Eriksen, J Grau', 'Bensadoun, R-J', 'Boers-Doets, C B', 'Lalla, R V', 'Peterson, D E']","['Carrozzo M', 'Eriksen JG', 'Bensadoun RJ', 'Boers-Doets CB', 'Lalla RV', 'Peterson DE']",,"['Center for Oral Health Research, Oral Medicine Department, School of Dental Sciences, Newcastle University, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Institut Nicois de Cancerologie (INC), Centre de Haute Energie, Nice, France.', 'CancerMed, Department of Medical Strategy, Wormer, The Netherlands.', 'Impaqtt Foundation, Department of Adverse Event Research & Valorisation, Wormer, The Netherlands.', 'Section of Oral Medicine, Department of Oral Health & Diagnostic Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, UConn Health, Farmington, CT.', 'Section of Oral Medicine, Department of Oral Health & Diagnostic Sciences, School of Dental Medicine & Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, UConn Health, Farmington, CT.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

However, the long-term trends in survival among adult leukemia patients and the associated sex and racial survival disparities are not well understood. We, therefore, evaluated the secular trends in survival improvement of leukemia patients from 1973 through 2014, using Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Result Survey Program (SEER) data. ICD-O-3 morphology codes were used to group leukemia into four types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Survival analysis for each leukemia type stratified by race/ethnicity, age, sex was performed to generate relative survival probability estimates for the baseline time period of 1973 through 1979. Hazard ratios (HR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival within subsequent 10-year time periods by race, age and sex were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Of the 83,255 leukemia patients for the current analysis, the 5-year survival of patients with ALL, AML, CLL, and CML during 1973-1979 were 42.0%, 6.5%, 66.5%, and 20.9%, respectively. Compared to the baseline, there were substantial improvements of leukemia-specific survival in 2010-2014 among African-American (81.0%) and Asian (80.0%) patients with CML and among 20-49 year of age with CLL (96.0%). African-American patients, those with AML and those older than 75 years of age had the lowest survival improvements. Asians experienced some of the largest survival improvements during the study period. Others, including African-American and the elderly, have not benefited as much from advances in leukemia treatment.","['Utuama, Ovie', 'Mukhtar, Fahad', 'Pham, Yen Thi-Hai', 'Dabo, Bashir', 'Manani, Priyashi', 'Moser, Jenna', 'Michael-Asalu, Abimbola', 'Tran, Chi Td', 'Le, Linh C', 'Le, Thanh V', 'Vu, Khanh Truong', 'Park, Jong Y', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Shu, Xiao-Ou', 'Luu, Hung N']","['Utuama O', 'Mukhtar F', 'Pham YT', 'Dabo B', 'Manani P', 'Moser J', 'Michael-Asalu A', 'Tran CT', 'Le LC', 'Le TV', 'Vu KT', 'Park JY', 'Boffetta P', 'Zheng W', 'Shu XO', 'Luu HN']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2172-1849'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Rehabilitation, Vinmec Times City Hospital, Vinmec Healthcare System, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America.', 'College of Arts and Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States of America.', 'Vietnam Colorectal Cancer and Research Program, Vinmec Healthcare System, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'College of Health Sciences, VinUniversity (VinUni), Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, 108 Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology, H.

Although researches on clarifying the relationships between lncRNAs and diseases are developing rapidly, associations between the lncRNAs and diseases are still remaining largely unknown. In this manuscript, a novel Local Random Walk based prediction model called LRWHLDA is proposed for inferring potential associations between human lncRNAs and diseases. In LRWHLDA, a new heterogeneous network is established first, which allows that LRWHLDA can be implemented in the case of lacking known lncRNA-disease associations. And then, an improved local random walk method is designed for prediction of novel lncRNA-disease associations, which can help LRWHLDA achieve high prediction accuracy but with low time complexity. Finally, in order to evaluate the prediction performance of LRWHLDA, different frameworks such as LOOCV, 2-folds CV, and 5-folds CV have been implemented, simulation results indicate that LRWHLDA can achieve reliable AUCs of 0.8037, 0.8354, and 0.8556 under the frameworks of 2-fold CV, 5-fold CV, and LOOCV, respectively. Hence, it is easy to know that LRWHLDA contains the potential to be a representative of emerging methods in the field of research on potential lncRNA-disease associations prediction.","['Li, Jiechen', 'Zhao, Haochen', 'Xuan, Zhanwei', 'Yu, Jingwen', 'Feng, Xiang', 'Liao, Bo', 'Wang, Lei']","['Li J', 'Zhao H', 'Xuan Z', 'Yu J', 'Feng X', 'Liao B', 'Wang L']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210603,United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,,,,2019/08/20 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2019.2934958 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2021 May-Jun;18(3):1049-1059. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2019.2934958.

METHODS: The proliferation rate of the leukemia cells was checked by CCK-8 assay. Apoptotic cell death was studied by acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) staining. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometery. Cell migration and invasion were checked by transwell assay. Protein expression were determined by immuno blotting. Xenografted mice models were used for in vivo evaluation of Nodakenetin. RESULTS: Nodakenetin could significantly inhibit the proliferation of the all the leukemia cells. The anticancer activity of Nodakenetin against the HL-60 cells was found to be due to G2/M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Nodakenetin prompted mitochondrial apoptosis which was also associated with alteration in the apoptosis-related protein expression (Bax and Bcl-2). It was also observed that Nodakenetin could inhibit the migration and invasion of the leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of the Nodakenetin were also investigated in vivo in xenografted mice models and it was found that this molecule could inhibit the growth of xenografted tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate Nodakenetin significantly inhibits the growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo and may be a valuable molecule in the management of leukemia, and as such needs further in depth investigations.","['Lei, Ping', 'Liao, Chushu', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Zhou, Ming']","['Lei P', 'Liao C', 'Chen J', 'Zhou M']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, Changsha, 410002 Hunan, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,2019/08/20 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2019 May-Jun;24(3):1219-1224.,20200317,1219-1224,,"['0 (Coumarins)', 'A4VZ22K1WT (coumarin)', 'H5D33D6K5D (marmesin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', 'Cell Movement', 'Coumarins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study (n = 166) was performed. MRD was determined using multiparameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: Pediatric ALL patients with pre-MRDneg had a lower cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR) compared to those with pre-MRDpos (19.7% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.009). Compared to post-MRDneg group, patients with post-MRDpos experienced higher CIR (81.0% vs. 15.9%, P < 0.001), inferior LFS (14.3% vs. 66.9%, P < 0.001) and OS (19.1% vs. 66.9%, P < 0.001). In regard to peri-MRD kinetics, compared with the MRD-decreasing group and MRDneg/MRDneg group, MRD-increasing group had higher CIR, lower probabilities of LFS and OS (P < 0.001). Compared to pre-MRDneg/post-MRDneg group, a higher CIR was found in the pre-MRDpos/post-MRDpos group (66.7% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001), pre-MRDpos/post-MRDneg group (32.0% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.016), and pre-MRDneg/post-MRDpos group (91.7% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001). A lower incidence of LFS and OS were found in pre-MRDpos/post-MRDpos group and pre-MRDneg/post-MRDpos group than in pre-MRDneg/post-MRDneg group (P < 0.05). Multivariate analyses confirmed the association of pre-MRD status, post-MRD status, and peri-MRD kinetics with outcomes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that, in the pediatric ALL subgroup, not only pre-MRD status or post-MRD status but also peri-SCT MRD dynamics, were associated with an increased CIR after haploidentical allografts. Patients are put into different risk group based on MRD kinetics versus single time MRD status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent stem cell transplant between 2007 and 2018 were enrolled retrospectively. The effects of pretransplant cytogenetic and minimal residual disease status, pretransplant consolidation therapies, development of graft-versus-host disease, postrelapse treatment protocols, and type of con-ditioning regimens on overall survival were analyzed. RESULTS: In 76 study patients, the cumulative overall 1- and 5-year relapse probabilities were 67.8% and 58.7%, respectively. Overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years in patients with and without relapse were 23.5% and 0% and 95.9% and 91.1% (P < .001), respectively. Although mean postrelapse overall survival was better with intensive salvage plus donor lymphocyte infusion, no significant differences were shown versus other therapies (intensive salvage, nonintensive salvage, intensive salvage or nonintensive salvage plus donor lymphocyte infusion, or supportive therapy). Twenty-three patients (30.3%) died during the study period with a median survival of 9.6 months. Patients with favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable cytogenetic status showed overall survival of 46.6 +/- 10.4, 54.6 +/- 4.4, and 36.9 +/- 5.9 months (P = .807). Patients with and without minimal residual disease and patients who received or did not receive consolidation therapy had similar overall survival. Relapse was an independent predictor of overall survival (increased mortality risk of 26.22). Patients who developed graft-versus-host disease showed decreased relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Relapse is the most important predictor of overall survival and is associated with poor prognosis.

We investigated the association between the ARID5B rs10821936 C > T, rs10994982 A > G, and susceptibility to ALL in a cohort of Egyptian individuals and investigated their role in relation to disease outcome. Real-time PCR typing was done for ARID5B rs10821936 and rs10994982 SNPs for 128 pediatric ALL (pALL), 45 adult ALL (aALL), and 436 healthy controls. Significant risk associations were found between the C allele (p < 0.001, OR = 2.02), CC genotype (p < 0.001, OR = 2.72), CT genotype (p = 0.011, OR = 1.45) of ARID5B rs10821936 and pediatric ALL especially T-ALL and adult ALL (p < 0.05). The CA haplotype (C allele of rs10821936 + A allele of rs10994982) was associated with the risk of ALL either pediatric ALL or adult ALL (p < 0.001). In the studied Egyptian population, it can be concluded that the C allele, CC, and CT genotypes of ARID5B rs10821936 and the CA haplotype may be a susceptibility risk factor for pediatric and adult ALL. However, the SNPs of ARID5B rs10821936 and rs10994982 were not found to be strongly associated with ALL outcomes.","['Mosaad, Youssef M', 'Khashaba, Mohamed', 'Darwish, Ahmad', 'Darwish, Mohamed', 'Elwassefy, Mona', 'Abdelmabood, Souzy', 'Fawzy, Iman M', 'Youssef, Laila F', 'Elbasiouny, Rehab A']","['Mosaad YM', 'Khashaba M', 'Darwish A', 'Darwish M', 'Elwassefy M', 'Abdelmabood S', 'Fawzy IM', 'Youssef LF', 'Elbasiouny RA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7148-0983', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1835-1867', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7295-9793', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8645-8669']","['Clinical Immunology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University , Mansoura , Egypt.', ""Neonatology Unit, Pediatric Department, Mansoura University Children's Hospital , Mansoura , Egypt."", ""Hematology/Oncology Unit, Pediatric Department, Mansoura University Children's Hospital , Mansoura , Egypt."", 'Clinical Immunology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University , Mansoura , Egypt.', 'Clinical Immunology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University , Mansoura , Egypt.', ""Hematology/Oncology Unit, Pediatric Department, Mansoura University Children's Hospital , Mansoura , Egypt."", 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Mansoura Fever Hospital, Ministry of Health , Mansoura , Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University , Mansoura , Egypt.', ""Pediatric Department, Mansoura University Children's Hospital , Mansoura , Egypt.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190819,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'ARDIB5 rs10821936', 'ARID5B rs10994982', 'Egyptian', 'RT-PCR', 'SNPs']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1649333 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Sep;36(6):365-375. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1649333.

The upregulated expression of receptors and modulators of the notch signaling pathway in endometriosis suggests an involvement in the pathogenetic process. Here, we investigated the effects of notch pathway inhibition by a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) on stemness-associated properties of the epithelial endometriotic cell line 12Z and of primary endometriotic stroma cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 12Z cells and primary endometriotic stroma cells of 7 patients were treated with or without GSI, and analyzed for changes in gene expression by TaqMan low-density arrays, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. The functional impact of GSI treatment was studied by MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, colony formation assay, annexin V apoptosis assay, and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity assays. RESULTS: In 12Z cells, GSI treatment reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and colony formation, and induced a shift to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Cell viability was decreased and apoptosis was increased in both cell models. GSI further induced transcriptional downregulation of the stemness-associated factors leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), sex-determining region Y (SRY)- box 2, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1, and hes-related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, in 12Z cells and in primary cell cultures. Downregulation of LIFR expression by GSI was confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data suggest that application of GSI may be a worthwhile approach in the treatment of endometriosis that warrants further investigation.","['Ramirez Williams, Laura', 'Bruggemann, Kathrin', 'Hubert, Marina', 'Achmad, Nurjannah', 'Kiesel, Ludwig', 'Schafer, Sebastian D', 'Greve, Burkhard', 'Gotte, Martin']","['Ramirez Williams L', 'Bruggemann K', 'Hubert M', 'Achmad N', 'Kiesel L', 'Schafer SD', 'Greve B', 'Gotte M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2360-2496'],"['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiotherapy-Radiooncology, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Munster University Hospital, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Bayer HealthCare/International', '691058/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190906,United States,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,0370343,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch', '*endometriosis', '*interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1', '*leukemia inhibitory factor receptor', '*podocalyxin-like', '*sex-determining region Y (SRY)- box 2', '*stem cells', '*therapy']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/aogs.13707 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2019 Dec;98(12):1565-1574. doi: 10.1111/aogs.13707.

This study evaluated outcomes in autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin who received early de-escalation of broad-spectrum antimicrobials prior to hematopoietic recovery versus those who continued broad-spectrum antimicrobials until hematopoietic recovery. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study assessed hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin. Patients were categorized into either cohort 1, representing early de-escalation prior to hematopoietic recovery, or cohort 2, representing continuation of broad-spectrum antimicrobials until hematopoietic recovery. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included (22.4% in cohort 1 and 77.6% in cohort 2). Most patients (87.5%) in cohort 1 underwent haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation, whereas 84.3% of patients in cohort 2 received autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. There were no significant differences in rates of recurrent fever (4.2% versus 7.2%, in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, adjusted odds ratio = 0.84, P = 0.85), re-escalation (4.2% versus 4.8%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.57, P = 0.64), and Clostridioides difficile-associated infections (4.2% versus 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 2.27, P = 0.43). No patient experienced in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, or bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin in which broad-spectrum antimicrobials were de-escalated prior to hematopoietic recovery did not experience adverse outcomes. These results concur with recently published studies and the Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia guidelines. An early de-escalation approach in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients specifically appears safe and may result in a reduction in antimicrobial utilization.","['Petteys, Megan M', 'Kachur, Ekaterina', 'Pillinger, Kelly E', 'He, Jiaxian', 'Copelan, Edward A', 'Shahid, Zainab']","['Petteys MM', 'Kachur E', 'Pillinger KE', 'He J', 'Copelan EA', 'Shahid Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9673-5359'],"['Antimicrobial Support Network, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Rochester Medical Center, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biostatistics, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190818,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antimicrobial de-escalation', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Febrile neutropenia', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219865303 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Apr;26(3):632-640. doi: 10.1177/1078155219865303.

However, a certain number of children with AML-DS have complicating comorbidities, including congenital heart disease (CHD), and are therefore ineligible for enrolment in clinical trials. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with AML-DS who were excluded from Japanese clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2015. RESULTS: Twelve children (six males and six females) were identified and were ineligible for CHD (n = 8) and other comorbidities, including hyperleukocytosis complicated with coagulopathy, severe hemophagocytosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (n = 1 each). The median age at the diagnosis was 14 months (range, 5 months to 11.5 years). Among all cases, 11 patients were treated with curative intent. Four patients were considered intolerant to intensive chemotherapy and received only low-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy: three failed to achieve remission and died of disease, while one successfully achieved remission but eventually died of infection. Seven cases underwent regular-intensive chemotherapy for AML-DS: six were alive and in remission; one had relapsed disease. One patient who received the best supportive care died of disease.

DIAGNOSIS: Hypereosinophilia has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1.5 x 10(9) /L, and may be associated with tissue damage. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of various tests. They include morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ-hybridization, flow immunophenotyping, and T-cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic hematolymphoid neoplasm. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2016 World Health Organization endorses a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes. This includes the major category ""myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 or with PCM1-JAK2"", and the MPN subtype, ""chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified"" (CEL, NOS). Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is an aberrant T-cell clone-driven reactive eosinophila, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a diagnosis of exclusion. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (eg, <1.5 x 10(9) /L) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close-follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alfa have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and in steroid-refractory cases of HES. In addition to hydroxyurea, second line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL, with outcomes reported for limited numbers of patients. The use of antibodies against interleukin-5 (IL-5) (mepolizumab), the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), as well as other targets on eosinophils remains an active area of investigation.","['Shomali, William', 'Gotlib, Jason']","['Shomali W', 'Gotlib J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6500-350X'],"['Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute/Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute/Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],['Stanford Cancer Institute/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2019/08/20 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25617 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Oct;94(10):1149-1167. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25617.,20200408,1149-1167,"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Disease Management', '*Eosinophilia/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Symptom Assessment', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, saturated FAs such as palmitic acid (PA) induce inflammatory signals in macrophages, whereas polyunsaturated FAs, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been related to anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have suggested a role of fatty acids on DNA methylation, epigenetically regulating gene expression in inflammation processes. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of PA and DHA on the inflammation-related genes on human macrophages. In addition, a second aim was to study the epigenetic mechanism underlying the effect of FAs on the inflammatory response. For these purposes, human acute monocytic leukaemia cells (THP-1) were differentiated into macrophages with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), followed by an incubation with PA or DHA. At the end of the experiment, mRNA expression, protein secretion, and CpG methylation of the following inflammatory genes were analysed: interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1) and interleukin 18 (IL18). The results showed that the treatment with PA increased IL-18 and TNF-alpha production. Contrariwise, the supplementation with DHA reduced IL-18, TNF-alpha and PAI-1 secretion by macrophages. However, the incubation with these fatty acids did not apparently modify the DNA methylation status of the investigated genes in the screened CpG sites. This research reveals that PA induces important pro-inflammatory markers in human macrophages, whereas DHA decreases the inflammatory response. Apparently, DNA methylation is not directly involved in the fatty acid-mediated regulation of the expression of these inflammation-related genes.","['Samblas, Mirian', 'Carraro, Julia C', 'Martinez, J Alfredo', 'Milagro, Fermin I']","['Samblas M', 'Carraro JC', 'Martinez JA', 'Milagro FI']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3228-9916'],"['Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology, Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical and Social Nutrition, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology, Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', 'CIBERobn, CIBER Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y Nutricion, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'IMDEA Food, Research Institute of Food & Health Sciences, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology, Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain. fmilagro@unav.es.', 'CIBERobn, CIBER Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y Nutricion, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. fmilagro@unav.es.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain. fmilagro@unav.es.']",['eng'],"['AGL2013-45554-R/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de', 'Espana', 'BES-2014-068409/Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte']",['Journal Article'],20190819,Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytokines', 'Epigenetics', 'Macrophages', 'PUFA', 'Saturated fatty acids']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13105-019-00685-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13105-019-00685-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2019 Aug;75(3):341-349. doi: 10.1007/s13105-019-00685-5.

However, skeletal side effects are commonly observed in pediatric patients receiving long-term treatment with IMA. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that IMA and NIL alter vitamin D metabolism, which may further impair bone metabolism. To determine whether TKIs directly affect bone cell function, the present study treated the human osteoblastic cell line SaOS-2 with IMA or NIL and assessed effects on their mineralization capacity as well as mRNA expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), two cytokines that regulate osteoclastogenesis. Both TKIs significantly inhibited mineralization and downregulated osteoblast marker genes, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osterix, as well as genes associated with the pro-osteogenic Wnt signaling pathway; NIL was more potent than IMA. In addition, both TKIs increased the RANKL/OPG ratio, which is known to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. The present results suggested that the TKIs IMA and NIL directly inhibited osteoblast differentiation and directly promoted a pro-osteoclastogenic environment through the RANKL-OPG signaling axis. Thus, we propose that future work is required to determine whether the bone health of CML patients undergoing TKI-treatment should be routinely monitored.","['Kroschwald, Lysann Michaela', 'Tauer, Josephine Tabea', 'Kroschwald, Sonja Ingrid', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Wiedenfeld, Anne', 'Beissert, Stefan', 'Bauer, Andrea', 'Rauner, Martina']","['Kroschwald LM', 'Tauer JT', 'Kroschwald SI', 'Suttorp M', 'Wiedenfeld A', 'Beissert S', 'Bauer A', 'Rauner M']",,"['Department of Dermatology, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Centre for Translational Bone, Joint and Soft Tissue Research, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shriners Hospital for Children, McGill University, Montreal QC H4A 0A9, Canada.', 'Simon Alberti Group, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, ETH Zurich, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III and Center for Healthy Aging, Medical Faculty, Technical University Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190621,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC6614669,['NOTNLM'],"['bone', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'osteoblastogenesis', 'receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand']",2019/08/20 06:00,2019/08/20 06:01,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2019.10518 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-10518 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2019 Aug;18(2):2102-2108. doi: 10.3892/ol.2019.10518.

We previously reported that patients carrying the AML1/ETO (A/E) fusion gene and expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) tended to develop EMI, and had a poor prognosis. In the present study, the relapse-free survival (RFS) time and overall survival (OS) time were significantly lower in patients with EMI. The results demonstrated that the EMI incidence was significantly higher (P<0.05), while the RFS and OS rates were significantly lower (P<0.05), in patients with high APP expression. Kasumi-1 cells, which are A/E(+), and the APP gene were used as the in vitro cell model to detect the mechanism of action in detail. Following the knockdown of APP expression, cell migration was significantly reduced (P<0.05). Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that the protein expression of phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and c-Myc was markedly reduced following interference of APP, while the expression of CXCR4 and MMP-9 was not altered. Kasumi-1 cells were co-cultured with p-ERK or c-Myc inhibitors and demonstrated that the APP/p-ERK/c-Myc/MMP-2 pathway was involved in signal transduction and regulation of cell migration. MicroRNA-144 (miR-144) mimics and transfected Kasumi-1 cells were generated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting demonstrated that miR-144 was a negative regulator of APP. Taken together, the findings of the present study suggest that miR-144 negatively targets the APP gene and regulates cell migration via the APP/p-ERK/c-Myc/MMP-2 pathway.","['Jiang, Ling', 'Meng, Wei', 'Yu, Guopan', 'Yin, Changxin', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Liao, Libin', 'Meng, Fanyi']","['Jiang L', 'Meng W', 'Yu G', 'Yin C', 'Wang Z', 'Liao L', 'Meng F']",,"['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510500, P.R.

Previous evidence has suggested that TAMs promote tumorigenesis, growth, invasion and metastasis, thereby affecting tumor metabolism. The mechanisms through which they affect the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells remain unclear. The present study investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of TAMs on the proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Human mononuclear leukemia THP-1 cells were induced into TAMs. The morphological changes that occurred during the induction of the THP-1 cells were examined with a light microscope. Successful TAM formation was confirmed via flow cytometry. Proliferation, invasion and migration of the lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were detected by EDU proliferation, scratch wound and Transwell invasion and migration assays, respectively. The expression levels of key proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were detected by western blot analysis. It was identified that treatment with interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate successfully induced THP-1 to form TAMs. The indirect coculture model of TAMs was established by Transwell chamber detection, and the proliferation, invasion and migration ability of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were enhanced. Western blot analysis indicated that the expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-PI3K and p-AKT proteins were significantly upregulated in the TAMs coculture group compared with that of the blank control group. In summary, the present study demonstrated that TAMs may promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in vitro, perhaps through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","['Yuan, Shiyang', 'Dong, Yaling', 'Peng, Laishui', 'Yang, Mei', 'Niu, Linxia', 'Liu, Zhiwen', 'Xie, Junping']","['Yuan S', 'Dong Y', 'Peng L', 'Yang M', 'Niu L', 'Liu Z', 'Xie J']",,"['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, P.R.

Abnormalities in gene structure and epigenetics of FOXN3 are closely associated with the occurrence of hematological malignancies; however, its involvement in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. The present study aimed to examine the potential significance of FOXN3 in AML. FOXN3 expression levels were examined in patients with AML and AML cell lines, and its clinical significance in AML was evaluated. FOXN3-overexpressing AML cell lines were established, and the biological function of FOXN3 was detected by flow cytometry and a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. A significant decrease in FOXN3 expression levels was observed in patients with AML and in the AML cell lines in vitro. FOXN3 expression levels were associated with the number of leukocytes in patients. FOXN3 overexpression may inhibit cell proliferation in AML cell lines, induce cell cycle S-phase arrest and promote apoptosis in OCI-AML3 and THP-AML cells. The present study provided insight into how FOXN3 may serve as a novel tumor suppressor in AML.","['He, Hang', 'Zhang, Jinjing', 'Qu, Yi', 'Wang, Yue', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Yan, Xiaojing', 'Li, Yan', 'Zhang, Rui']","['He H', 'Zhang J', 'Qu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Yan X', 'Li Y', 'Zhang R']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, P.R.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) expression in PTCL. A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the present study, including 43 with PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), 10 with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 14 with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TCL) and 15 with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). EZH2 and HDAC1/2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and any correlations between them were evaluated. Additionally, any correlations between EZH2 or HDAC1/2 expression and a number of clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed, and survival curves were created. Results revealed that 55.8% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 86.7% of patients ALCL and 50% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC1. Furthermore, 58.1% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 53.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC2. Additionally, 67.5% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 50% of patients with NK/TCL, 73.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed EZH2. EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with the presence of B symptoms, elevated LDH and elevated beta2 microglobulin (B2M; P<0.05), and HDAC2 expression was significantly correlated with sex, advanced clinical stages, high international prognostic index scores and elevated B2M levels (P<0.05) in all the patients with PTCL. However, different subtypes of PTCL are correlated with different clinical characteristics. Patients with PTCL highly expressing EZH2 or HDAC2 exhibit a poorer overall survival rate. In conclusion, EZH2 and HDAC1/2 were frequently upregulated in patients with PTCL, and the patients with a higher EZH2 and HDAC2 expression usually exhibited a poorer survival rate. Therefore, EZH2 and HDAC2 may be prognostic markers in patients with PTCL, particularly in those with PTCL-NOS.","['Zhang, Huilai', 'Lv, Huijuan', 'Jia, Xiaohui', 'Hu, Ge', 'Kong, Lingzhe', 'Zhang, Tingting', 'Li, Linyu', 'Pan, Yi', 'Zhai, Qiongli', 'Meng, Bin', 'Wang, Xi', 'Wang, Huaqing', 'Wang, Xianhuo']","['Zhang H', 'Lv H', 'Jia X', 'Hu G', 'Kong L', 'Zhang T', 'Li L', 'Pan Y', 'Zhai Q', 'Meng B', 'Wang X', 'Wang H', 'Wang X']",,"['Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, P.R.

In adults, however, the HH pathway remains integral to the proliferation, maintenance, and apoptosis of adult stem cells including hematopoietic stem cells. Areas covered: We discuss the current understanding of the HH pathway as it relates to normal hematopoiesis, the pathology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the rationale for and data from combination therapies including HH pathway inhibitors, and ultimately the prospects that might offer promise in targeting this pathway in AML. Expert opinion: Efforts to target the HH pathway have been focused on impeding this disposition and restoring chemosensitivity to conventional myeloid neoplasm therapies. The year 2018 saw the first approval of a HH pathway inhibitor (glasdegib) for AML, though for an older population and in combination with an uncommonly-used therapy. Several other clinical trials with agents targeting modulators of HH signaling in AML and MDS are underway. Further study and understanding of the interplay between the numerous aspects of HH signaling and how it relates to the augmented survival of AML will provide a more reliable substrate for therapeutic strategies in patients with this poor-risk disease.","['Shallis, Rory M', 'Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Boddu, Prajwal C', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Shallis RM', 'Bewersdorf JP', 'Boddu PC', 'Zeidan AM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8542-2944', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9408-5882']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University , New Haven , CT , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190817,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Hedgehog', '*glasdegib', '*myeloid']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2019.1652095 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2019 Aug;19(8):717-729. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2019.1652095.

The last decade's research has brought attention to molecular genetic alterations as strong contributors of leukemogenesis. AML with trisomy 8 seems to be associated with mutations in DNA methylation genes, spliceosome complex genes, and myeloid transcription factor genes, and these alterations probably have stronger implication for leukemic pathogenesis, treatment and hence prognosis, than the existence of trisomy 8 itself. Especially mutations in the RUNX1 and ASXL1 genes occur in high frequencies, and search for such mutations should be mandatory part of the diagnostic workup. AML with trisomy 8 is classified as intermediate-risk AML after recent European Leukemia Net (ELN) classification, and hence allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) should be consider as consolidation therapy for this patient group.Trisomy 8 is frequently occurring in AML, although future molecular genetic workup should be performed, to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.","['Hemsing, Anette Lodvir', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Tsykunova, Galina', 'Reikvam, Hakon']","['Hemsing AL', 'Hovland R', 'Tsykunova G', 'Reikvam H']",,"['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190926,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*molecular genetics', '*prognostic impact', '*trisomy 8']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/08/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1657400 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Nov;12(11):947-958. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1657400.

Butadiene diepoxide (DEB), the most mutagenic of three epoxides resulting from BD, forms DNA-DNA crosslink adducts that can lead to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Thus, a study was designed to determine if (+/-)-DEB exposure of HL60cells, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line lacking the Philadelphia chromosome, can produce t(9;22) translocations. In HL60cells exposed for 3h to 0-10muM DEB, overlapping dose-response curves suggested a direct relationship between 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol crosslink adduct formation (R=0.977, P=0.03) and cytotoxicity (R=0.961, P=0.002). Experiments to define the relationships between cytotoxicity and the induction of micronuclei (MN), a dosimeter of DNA DSBs, showed that 24h exposures of HL60cells to 0-5.0muM DEB caused significant positive correlations between the concentration and (i) the degree of cytotoxicity (R=0.998, p=0.002) and (ii) the frequency of MN (R=0.984, p=0.016) at 48h post exposure. To determine the relative induction of MN and t(9;22) translocations following exposures to DEB, or x-rays as a positive control for formation of t(9;22) translocations, HL60cells were exposed for 24h to 0, 1, 2.5, or 5muM DEB or to 0, 2.0, 3.5, or 5.0Gy x-rays, or treatments demonstrated to yield 0, 20%, 50%, or 80% cytotoxicity. Treatments between 0 and 3.5Gy x-rays caused significant dose-related increases in both MN (p<0.001) and t(9;22) translocations (p=0.01), whereas DEB exposures causing similar cytotoxicity levels did not increase translocations over background. These data indicate that, while DEB induces DNA DSBs required for formation of MN and translocations, acute DEB exposures of HL60cells did not produce the Philadelphia chromosome obligatory for CML.","['Walker, Vernon E', 'Degner, Amanda', 'Carter, Elizabeth W', 'Nicklas, Janice A', 'Walker, Dale M', 'Tretyakova, Natalia', 'Albertini, Richard J']","['Walker VE', 'Degner A', 'Carter EW', 'Nicklas JA', 'Walker DM', 'Tretyakova N', 'Albertini RJ']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, United States.

Among them, compounds 11d, 11e and 11f were the most potential ones with IC50 values of 0.55muM, 0.86muM and 0.80muM against BRD4, and exhibited remarkable antiproliferative activities against MV4-11 cells with IC50 values of 0.19muM, 0.32muM and 0.12muM, respectively. Moreover, in western blot assay, compound 11e induced down-regulation of C-Myc, which is a significant downstream gene of BRD4. Cell cycle analysis assay also showed that compound 11e could block MV4-11 cells at G0/G1 phase. Taken together, our results suggested that compound 11e and its derivatives were a class of novel structural potential BRD4 inhibitors and could serve as lead compounds for further exploration.","['Rong, Juan', 'Feng, Zhan-Zhan', 'Shi, Yao-Jie', 'Ren, Jing', 'Xu, Ying', 'Wang, Ning-Yu', 'Xue, Qiang', 'Liu, Kun-Lin', 'Zhou, Shu-Yan', 'Wei, Wei', 'Yu, Luo-Ting']","['Rong J', 'Feng ZZ', 'Shi YJ', 'Ren J', 'Xu Y', 'Wang NY', 'Xue Q', 'Liu KL', 'Zhou SY', 'Wei W', 'Yu LT']",,"['Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.

Herein, we report the first adult case of PRES concurrent with HHV-6 encephalitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. This case suggests that HHV-6 reactivation is associated with the pathogenesis of PRES. Also, PRES and HHV-6 encephalitis cause similar symptoms, and switching the immunosuppressant from calcineurin inhibitor to prednisolone for treating PRES may worsen HHV-6 encephalitis. Therefore, we should pay attention to the complication of HHV-6 encephalitis even after PRES is diagnosed.","['Ito, Yusuke', 'Toyama, Kazuhiro', 'Honda, Akira', 'Nakazaki, Kumi', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Ito Y', 'Toyama K', 'Honda A', 'Nakazaki K', 'Arai S', 'Kurokawa M']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan; Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan.

We ought to describe the prevalence and characteristics of PH in a cohort of MPN who were screened using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). METHODS: One hundred eighty-three newly diagnosed consecutive MPN patients were prospectively evaluated using TTE to detect PH. RESULTS: Two patients were diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, two patients had post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) myelofibrosis (MF), two patients had post-polycythemia vera (PV) MF, 11 patients had primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 28 patients had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 51 patients had PV, and 87 patients had ET. TTE was used to determine PH, and PH was suspected in 16 of 183 patients as follows: four with PV, seven with ET, two with PMF, and three with CML. Two patients with ET were excluded because of global cardiac failure. Three patients underwent right heart catheterization to confirm PH. The 14 (7.7%) patients with PH had no cardiac or lung disease that directly involved MPN in PH development. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of 183 MPN patients, TTE was used to diagnose PH, and 14 patients (7.7%) developed PH. This prevalence was lower than expected based on previously reported data, but it remains higher than in the general population.","['Venton, Geoffroy', 'Turcanu, Mihai', 'Colle, Julien', 'Thuny, Franck', 'Chebrek, Safia', 'Farnault, Laure', 'Mercier, Cedric', 'Ivanov, Vadim', 'Fanciullino, Raphaelle', 'Suchon, Pierre', 'Jarrot, Pierre-Andre', 'Aissi, Karim', 'Roche, Pauline', 'Cautela, Jennifer', 'Arcani, Robin', 'Costello, Regis']","['Venton G', 'Turcanu M', 'Colle J', 'Thuny F', 'Chebrek S', 'Farnault L', 'Mercier C', 'Ivanov V', 'Fanciullino R', 'Suchon P', 'Jarrot PA', 'Aissi K', 'Roche P', 'Cautela J', 'Arcani R', 'Costello R']",,"['Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, UMR1090 TAGC, Marseille F_13288, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France; General Medicine Department, Aix-Marseille University, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, UMR1090 TAGC, Marseille F_13288, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Marseille, Mediterranean University Cardio-Oncology Center, Unit of Heart Failure and Valvular Heart Diseases, Department of Cardiology, Hopital Nord, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille University, Inserm, Inra, Centre for Cardio-Vascular and Nutrition research (C2VN), Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital of Avignon, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France; UMR-911 INSERM, Toxicokinetics and Pharmacokinetics Laboratory, Pharmacological Faculty, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France.', 'SMARTc Unit, Pharmacokinetics Laboratory, UMR_911 CRO2 AMU, Marseille, France; Pharmacy Unit, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, APHM, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, La Timone, University Hospital of Marseille, France; UMR 1062 NORT, INSERM, Marseille, France.', 'Internal Medicine and Clinic Immunology Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France; Center for Cardiovascular and Nutrition Research, INRA 1260, INSERM _S1263, Aix-Marseille University, France.', 'Internal Medicine Department, North Hospital, University Hospital of Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Marseille, Mediterranean University Cardio-Oncology Center, Unit of Heart Failure and Valvular Heart Diseases, Department of Cardiology, Hopital Nord, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille University, Inserm, Inra, Centre for Cardio-Vascular and Nutrition research (C2VN), Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department, La Conception, University Hospital of Marseille, France.

In solid tumors, TGF-beta secreted from tumor microenvironment acts as a suppresser against host immunity, like natural killer (NK) cells, to favor tumor evasion. However, besides solid tumors, the underlying mechanism of how TGF-beta regulates leukemogenesis, tumor progression, immunoediting, and NK function is still not clear in detail. In this study, we found that TGF-beta induced leukemia MEG-01 and U937 cells to become less sensitive to NK-92MI targeting by down-regulating CD48, a ligand for NK activating receptor 2B4, but not down-regulating other tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). In CD48-knockdown cells, cells responding to NK-92MI targeting displayed a phenotype of less NK susceptibility and cell conjugation. On the other hand, when NK cells were treated with TGF-beta, TGF-beta suppressed NK recognition, degranulation, and killing activity in time-dependent manner by regulating ICAM-1 binding capacity instead of affecting expressions of activating and inhibitory receptors. Taken together, both leukemia cells and immune NK cells could be regulated by TGF-beta through suppressing leukemia cell surface CD48 to escape from host surveillance and down-regulating NK cell surface ICAM-1 binding activity to impair NK functions, respectively. Our results suggested that TGF-beta had effect in leukemia similar to that observed in solid tumors but through different regulatory mechanism.","['Huang, Chin-Han', 'Liao, Yi-Jen', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Huang, Hsin-Ting', 'Lin, Yen-Hsi', 'Twu, Yuh-Ching']","['Huang CH', 'Liao YJ', 'Chiou TJ', 'Huang HT', 'Lin YH', 'Twu YC']",,"['Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Taipei Municipal Wanfang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.

ASNase primarily depletes circulating asparagine, and the endogenously expressed enzyme, asparagine synthetase (ASNS), replenishes asparagine. ASNS was suggested previously to be highly expressed in the pancreas. In this study, we determined the expression pattern of ASNS in the pancreas and the mechanism for increased pancreatic ASNS abundance. Compared with other organs, ASNS was highly expressed in both the human and mouse pancreas, and, within the pancreas, ASNS was present primarily in the acinar cells. The high baseline pancreatic ASNS was associated with higher baseline activation of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling in the pancreas, and inhibition of PERK in acinar cells lessened ASNS expression. ASNase exposure, but not the common pancreatitis triggers, uniquely up-regulated ASNS expression, indicating that the increase is mediated by nutrient stress. The up-regulation of acinar ASNS with ASNase exposure was owing to increased transcriptional rather than delayed degradation. Knockdown of ASNS in the 266-6 acinar cells provoked acinar cell injury and worsened ASNase-induced injury, whereas ASNS overexpression protected against ASNase-induced injury. In summary, ASNS is highly expressed in the pancreatic acinar cells through heightened basal activation of PERK, and ASNS appears to be crucial to maintaining acinar cell integrity. The implications are that ASNS is especially hardwired in the pancreas to protect against both baseline perturbations and nutrient deprivation stressors, such as during ASNase exposure.","['Mukherjee, Amitava', 'Ahmed, Nayyar', 'Rose, Fateema T', 'Ahmad, Abraheem N', 'Javed, Tanveer A', 'Wen, Li', 'Bottino, Rita', 'Xiao, Xiangwei', 'Kilberg, Michael S', 'Husain, Sohail Z']","['Mukherjee A', 'Ahmed N', 'Rose FT', 'Ahmad AN', 'Javed TA', 'Wen L', 'Bottino R', 'Xiao X', 'Kilberg MS', 'Husain SZ']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Natural Sciences, University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, Greensburg, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.

However, the mechanisms of its anti-tumor effects are still elusive. Angiogenesis is a key process for tumor initiation, and increasing evidence has supported the role of anti-angiogenesis caused by arsenic in tumor suppression, although the detailed mechanism is not well understood. In the present study, we found that As2O3 significantly inhibited the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, and this was mediated by the upregulation of FoxO3a. Knockdown of FoxO3a could restore the angiogenic ability of HUVECs.

The purpose of this study is to report pulmonary, renal, thyroid, and cataract toxicities from a prospective trial monitoring patients up to 8 years after TMI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 142 patients with primarily multiple myeloma or acute leukemia undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation were evaluated. Follow-up included pulmonary function tests, serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, thyroid panel, and ophthalmologic examinations performed at 100 days, 6 months, and annually. Median TMI dose was 14 Gy (10-19 Gy) delivered at 1.5 to 2.0 Gy twice per day at a dose-rate of 200 cGy/min. RESULTS: Median age was 52 years (range 9-70). Median follow-up (range) for all patients was 2 years (0-8) and for patients alive at the time of last follow-up (n = 50), 5.5 years (0-8). Mean organ doses in Gy were lung 7.0, kidneys 7.1, thyroid 6.7, and lens 2.8. The crude incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) was 1 of 142 (0.7%). The cumulative incidence of infection and RP (I/RP) was 22.7% at 2 years post-TMI. Mean lung dose </=8 Gy predicted for significantly lower rates of I/RP (2-year cumulative incidence 20.8% vs 31.8%, P = .012). No radiation-induced renal toxicity was noted. Hypothyroidism occurred in 6.0% and cataract formation in 7.0% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: TMI delivered with intensity modulated radiation therapy results in lower organ doses and was associated with fewer toxicities compared with historical cohorts treated with conventional total body irradiation. Keeping the mean lung dose to 8 Gy or less was associated with lower pulmonary complications. Further evaluation in clinical trials of intensity modulated radiation therapy to deliver TMI, total marrow and lymphoid irradiation, and organ sparing conformal total body irradiation is warranted.","['Shinde, Ashwin', 'Yang, Dongyun', 'Frankel, Paul', 'Liu, An', 'Han, Chunhui', 'Del Vecchio, Bianca', 'Schultheiss, Timothy', 'Cheng, Jonathan', 'Li, Richard', 'Kim, Daniel', 'Radany, Eric H', 'Hui, Susanta', 'Somlo, George', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Stein, Anthony', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Wong, Jeffrey Y C']","['Shinde A', 'Yang D', 'Frankel P', 'Liu A', 'Han C', 'Del Vecchio B', 'Schultheiss T', 'Cheng J', 'Li R', 'Kim D', 'Radany EH', 'Hui S', 'Somlo G', 'Rosenthal J', 'Stein A', 'Forman S', 'Wong JYC']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.

However, there were few reports on the effects and underlying mechanism of PPI in human acute myeloid leukemia cells. The present study demonstrated that PPI had an inhibitory effect through inducing apoptosis and autophagy in THP-1 and NB4 cells. PPI induced apoptosis via activating JNK pathway, as evidenced by the decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased Bax, cleaved-caspase-3 and phosphorylated-JNK expressions. In addition, PPI promoted autophagy as evidenced with increased expressions of LC3-II and Beclin-1 in western blot and autophagic vacuoles in MDC staining, which was associated with the inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathway. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor SP600125 and autophagy inhibitor 3-MA were employed to evaluate the role of apoptosis and autophagy in PPI-induced cell death. We found that autophagy and apoptosis were both causes of cell death induced by PPI. These data suggested that PPI could be a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of human acute myeloid leukemia.","['Tian, Ye', 'Jia, Si-Xun', 'Shi, Jie', 'Gong, Guan-Yu', 'Yu, Jia-Wen', 'Niu, Yan', 'Yang, Chen-Meng', 'Ma, Xiao-Chi', 'Fang, Mei-Yun']","['Tian Y', 'Jia SX', 'Shi J', 'Gong GY', 'Yu JW', 'Niu Y', 'Yang CM', 'Ma XC', 'Fang MY']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, 116001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, 116001, China.', 'The Institute for Translational Medicine, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, 116001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, 116001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, 116001, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Academy of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116021, China; Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, 116001, China.

It is cleared by hepatic oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and via hepatic (biliary) efflux mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. Bottom-up physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed to predict vincristine disposition in pediatric and adult populations. The models incorporated physicochemical properties, metabolism by CYP3A4/5, efflux by P-gp, and intracellular binding to beta-tubulin. The adult and pediatric PBPK models predicted pharmacokinetics (PK) within twofold of the observed PK parameters (area under the curve, terminal half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance). Simulating a higher hypothetical (4.9-fold) pediatric expression of beta-tubulin relative to adult improved predictions of vincristine PKs. To our knowledge, this is the first time that intracellular binding has been incorporated into a pediatric PBPK model. Utilizing this PBPK modeling approach, safe and effective doses of vincristine could be predicted.","['Lee, Christine M', 'Zane, Nicole R', 'Veal, Gareth', 'Thakker, Dhiren R']","['Lee CM', 'Zane NR', 'Veal G', 'Thakker DR']",,"['Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', ""The Center for Clinical Pharmacology at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190830,United States,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,101580011,PMC6813170,,,2019/08/20 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/08/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/psp4.12453 [doi]'],ppublish,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol. 2019 Oct;8(10):759-768. doi: 10.1002/psp4.12453.

Whether zanubrutinib, a second-generation selective BTK inhibitor, has similar effects as ibrutinib remains to be determined. Dynamics of number and immunophenotype of immune cells during zanubrutinib treatment in 25 R/R CLL/SLL patients were examined by flow cytometry and blood routine tests. The expression intensity of programmed death-1 (PD-1) on total CD4(+) (P < .01), total CD8(+) (P < .01), and T helper cells (P < .05) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) on total CD4(+) (P = .010) and regulatory T cells (P < .05) reduced after treatment. There were significant differences in expression intensity of CD19 (P < .01), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) (P < .01), and CD49d (P < .05) on B cells before and after treatment. Downregulation of PD-1 on T cells and CXCR5 and CD19 on B cells were observed in nearly all patients after zanubrutinib treatment. Programmed death-ligand 1 expression downregulated, especially in the female, CLL, normal spleen, normal beta2-macroglobulin (beta2-MG) and abnormal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) subgroups, and CTLA-4 expression on CD4+ T cells tended to decrease in the male, old, CLL, splenomegaly, abnormal beta2-MG, normal LDH, IGHV-mutated and wild-type tumor protein 53 subgroups after zanubrutinib treatment. These findings suggest that zanubrutinib can regulate immunity primarily by improving T cell exhaustion, inhibiting suppressor cells and disrupting CLL cells migration through downregulation of adhesion/homing receptors. Furthermore, favorable changes in cell number and immunophenotype were preferably observed in patients without adverse prognostic factors.","['Zou, Yi-Xin', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Li, Xiao-Tong', 'Xia,

The updated version relied on sparse primary care evidence and published without input from key stakeholders, for example, acute general paediatricians and paediatric haematologists/oncologists. This led to a document that fell short as a practical guide for referring physicians managing children with potentially life-threatening conditions. Following discussions between the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG, the UK multidisciplinary professional body for healthcare professionals caring for children with cancer) and NICE, it was agreed that a practical supplement should be produced for the 2015 guidance. A prerequisite was evidence gathering from tertiary care to balance the existing primary care evidence, and a Delphi consensus method was therefore convened. METHODS: A CCLG NICE Guidance Committee formulated 25 draft statements for review. The CCLG emailed its paediatric haematologist/oncologist membership (n=179) and 88 responded (49%). To achieve consensus, statements required >/=70% agreement from >/=60% of actual respondents, from the denominator (n=88). RESULTS: Fifteen of 25 original statements were accepted at the first round of voting. Three of 25 statements where >50% did not support were rejected outright. One statement could not be revised without replicating a previously accepted statement. The six remaining statements were revised and a second round of voting undertaken; all six revised statements were accepted. Overall, 21 of 25 statements (84%) met consensus criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This expert opinion should help streamline suspected cancer referral in children and help optimise subsequent outcomes.","['Murray, Matthew J', 'Ruffle, Amy', 'Lowis, Stephen', 'Howell, Lisa', 'Shanmugavadivel, Dhurgshaarna', 'Dommett, Rachel', 'Gamble, Ashley', 'Shenton, Geoff', 'Nicholson, James']","['Murray MJ', 'Ruffle A', 'Lowis S', 'Howell L', 'Shanmugavadivel D', 'Dommett R', 'Gamble A', 'Shenton G', 'Nicholson J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4480-1147'],"['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, Bristol, UK.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, Liverpool, UK."", ""General Paediatrics, Nottingham Children's hospital, Nottingham, UK."", 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, Bristol, UK.', ""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, Leicester, UK."", ""Paediatric Haematology, Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK."", 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK james.nicholson@addenbrookes.nhs.uk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190816,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CCLG', '*NICE', '*consensus', '*delphi', '*paediatric, pathway', '*referral', '*suspected cancer']",2019/08/20 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/08/18 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['archdischild-2019-317235 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2019-317235 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2020 Mar;105(3):241-246. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2019-317235.

In this study, the effect of basal ferritin values on prognosis and survival was investigated in MDS patients without history of transfusion. METHODS: Data were retrospectively analyzed for 62 MDS cases. The cases were divided into two groups according to ferritin values. RESULTS: The mean survival time was 61.1+/-4.8 months. During the follow-up period, 34 (54.8%) patients deceased. Median ferritin level was 358ng/mL. The serum ferritin (SF) level associated with mortality was determined as 400ng/mL (ROC area for SF was 0.731 with a cutoff value of 400; sensitivity and specificity were 70.7% and 68.2%, respectively) (P=0.002). There were 29 (46.8%) patients with serum ferritin levels of >/=400ng/mL. Patients with serum ferritin levels>/=400ng/mL had low survival rates. Ferritin>/=400ng/mL was associated with six times increased mortality (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the acceptable ferritin level at the start of chelation therapy is 1000ng/mL, the fact that 400ng/mL value is associated with survival in our study suggests that it may be useful to start chelation therapy in the early period. Further case studies on the subject are required.","['Senturk Yikilmaz, A', 'Akinci, S', 'Bakanay, S M', 'Dilek, I']","['Senturk Yikilmaz A', 'Akinci S', 'Bakanay SM', 'Dilek I']",,"['Department of Hematology, Yildirim Beyazit University, 06010 Ankara, Turkey.

The molecular events underlying how a given physiological stimulus changes this ratio to trigger apoptosis remains unclear. We report here that human 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and its related steroid hormones induce apoptosis by binding directly to phosphodiesterase 3A, which in turn recruits and stabilizes an otherwise fast-turnover protein Schlafen 12 (SLFN12). The elevated SLFN12 binds to ribosomes to exclude the recruitment of signal recognition particles (SRPs), thereby blocking the continuous protein translation occurring on the endoplasmic reticulum of E2-treated cells. These proteins include Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, whose ensuing decrease triggers apoptosis. The SLFN12 protein and an apoptosis activation marker were co-localized in syncytiotrophoblast of human placentas, where levels of estrogen-related hormones are high, and dynamic cell turnover by apoptosis is critical for successful implantation and placenta development.","['Li, Dianrong', 'Chen, Jie', 'Ai, Youwei', 'Gu, Xiaoqiong', 'Li, Li', 'Che, Di', 'Jiang, Zhaodi', 'Li, Lin', 'Chen, She', 'Huang, Huangwei', 'Wang, Jiawen', 'Cai, Tao', 'Cao, Yang', 'Qi, Xiangbin', 'Wang, Xiaodong']","['Li D', 'Chen J', 'Ai Y', 'Gu X', 'Li L', 'Che D', 'Jiang Z', 'Li L', 'Chen S', 'Huang H', 'Wang J', 'Cai T', 'Cao Y', 'Qi X', 'Wang X']",,"['National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China; National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, Guangdong, China; Clinical Biological Resource Bank and Clinical Lab, Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Clinical Biological Resource Bank and Clinical Lab, Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, Guangdong, China."", 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing 102206, China; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

METHODS: A literature review was performed for retrieving from PubMed papers indexed with keywords and free terms related to BTI. Independent review allowed the two section editors to select a list of 14 candidate best papers which were subsequently peer-reviewed. A final consensus meeting gathering the whole IMIA Yearbook editorial committee was organized to finally decide on the selection of the best papers. RESULTS: Among the 636 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various subareas of BTI, the review process selected four best papers. The first paper presents a computational method to identify molecular markers for targeted treatment of acute myeloid leukemia using multi-omics data (genome-wide gene expression profiles) and in vitro sensitivity to 160 chemotherapy drugs. The second paper describes a deep neural network approach to predict the survival of patients suffering from glioma on the basis of digitalised pathology images and genomics biomarkers. The authors of the third paper adopt a pan-cancer approach to take benefit of multi-omics data for drug repurposing.

The remarkable intrinsic resistance of Fusarium species to most antifungal agents results in high mortality rates in the immunocompromised population.Aims. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, clinical features and antifungal susceptibility of Fusarium isolates in patients with invasive fusariosis.Methodology. A total of 27 patients admitted to a referral hospital from January 2008 to June 2017 were evaluated. Antifungal susceptibility testing of isolates was performed by broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.Results. Haematological malignancy was the predominant underlying condition, with an incidence of invasive fusariosis of 14.8 cases per 1000 patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia and 13.1 cases per 1000 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. The Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) was the most frequent agent group, followed by the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC). Voriconazole showed the best activity against Fusarium, followed by amphotericin B. Itraconazole showed high minimum inhibitory concentration values, indicating in vitro resistance. Clinical FSSC isolates were significantly (P<0.05) more resistant to amphotericin B and voriconazole than FOSC isolates.Conclusion. The present antifungal susceptibility profiles indicate a high incidence of fusariosis in patients with haematological malignancy. Species- and strain-specific differences in antifungal susceptibility exist within Fusarium in this setting.","['Rosa, Priscila Dalle da', 'Ramirez-Castrillon, Mauricio', 'Borges, Rafael', 'Aquino, Valerio', 'Meneghello Fuentefria, Alexandre', 'Zubaran Goldani, Luciano']","['Rosa PDD', 'Ramirez-Castrillon M', 'Borges R', 'Aquino V', 'Meneghello Fuentefria A', 'Zubaran Goldani L']",,"['Experimental Research Center, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Medicine: Medical Sciences, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Research Group in Mycology, Universidad Santiago de Cali, Cali, Colombia.', 'Experimental Research Center, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Experimental Research Center, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Medicine: Medical Sciences, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Med Microbiol,Journal of medical microbiology,0224131,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fusarium oxysporum species complex', 'Fusarium solani species complex', 'antifungal susceptibility', 'invasive fusariosis']",2019/08/17 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jmm.0.001059 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Microbiol. 2019 Oct;68(10):1489-1496. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.001059.,20191011,1489-1496,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusariosis/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Fusarium/classification/*drug effects/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Phylogeny', 'Voriconazole/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,
31419095,NLM,MEDLINE,20211204,1936-2692 (Electronic) 1088-0224 (Linking),25,8,2019 Aug,The potential impact of CAR T-cell treatment delays on society.,,"OBJECTIVES: To date, breakthrough chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, such as tisagenlecleucel, indicated for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and axicabtagene ciloleucel, indicated for DLBCL, although clinically effective, have been limited by treatment delays. Our study measured the social value of CAR T-cell therapy (CAR T) for relapsed or refractory pALL and DLBCL in the United States and quantified social value lost due to treatment delays. STUDY DESIGN: We used an economic framework for therapy valuation, measuring social value as the sum of consumer surplus and manufacturer profit. Consumer surplus is the difference between the value of health gains from a therapy and its incremental cost, while accounting for indirect costs and benefits to patients. METHODS: For 20 incident cohorts of pALL (n = 20 x 400 = 8000) and DLBCL (n = 20 x 5902 = 118,040), we quantified patient value, calculated as the value of additional quality-adjusted life-years gained with CAR T, minus the incremental cost of CAR T compared with standard of care (SOC). We calculated manufacturer profits using a range of production costs given uncertainties in the production process. Patient value and manufacturer profits were summed to obtain total social value. We measured social value lost from treatment delays, assuming that patients received the SOC while awaiting CAR T-cell treatment. RESULTS: Depending on production costs, as much as $6.5 billion and $34.8 billion in social value was generated for patients with pALL and DLBCL, respectively. However, with 1, 2, or 6 months of treatment delay (assuming $200,000 production costs), the pALL population lost 9.8%, 36.2%, and 67.3% of social value, respectively, whereas the DLBCL population lost 4.2%, 11.5%, and 46.0%, relative to no delay. CONCLUSIONS: The social value of CAR T is significantly limited by treatment delays. Efficient payment mechanisms, adequate capital, and payment policy reform are urgently needed to increase patient access and maximize the value of CAR T.","['Thornton Snider, Julia', 'Brauer, Michelle', 'Kee, Rebecca', 'Batt, Katharine', 'Karaca-Mandic, Pinar', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Goldman, Dana P']","['Thornton Snider J', 'Brauer M', 'Kee R', 'Batt K', 'Karaca-Mandic P', 'Zhang J', 'Goldman DP']",,"['Precision Health Economics, 1999 Harrison St, Ste 1420, Oakland, CA 94612.

This glycomics-centric study investigates a possible link between protein paucimannosylation, an under-studied class of human N-glycosylation [Man1-3 GlcNAc2 Fuc0-1 ], and cancer. The paucimannosidic glycans (PMGs) of 34 cancer cell lines and 133 tissue samples spanning 11 cancer types and matching non-cancerous specimens are profiled from 467 published and unpublished PGC-LC-MS/MS N-glycome datasets collected over a decade. PMGs, particularly Man2-3 GlcNAc2 Fuc1 , are prominent features of 29 cancer cell lines, but the PMG level varies dramatically across and within the cancer types (1.0-50.2%). Analyses of paired (tumor/non-tumor) and stage-stratified tissues demonstrate that PMGs are significantly enriched in tumor tissues from several cancer types including liver cancer (p = 0.0033) and colorectal cancer (p = 0.0017) and is elevated as a result of prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia progression (p < 0.05). Surface expression of paucimannosidic epitopes is demonstrated on human glioblastoma cells using immunofluorescence while biosynthetic involvement of N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase is indicated by quantitative proteomics. This intriguing association between protein paucimannosylation and human cancers warrants further exploration to detail the biosynthesis, cellular location(s), protein carriers, and functions of paucimannosylation in tumorigenesis and metastasis.","['Chatterjee, Sayantani', 'Lee, Ling Y', 'Kawahara, Rebeca', 'Abrahams, Jodie L', 'Adamczyk, Barbara', 'Anugraham, Merrina', 'Ashwood,

The secondary objective was to assess the utility of pretransplant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment in AML. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed survival outcomes in 338 adult AML patients (with and without CNS-AML) after allo-HCT. CNS involvement was defined as clinical, pathological, or radiological evidence of CNS involvement any time after diagnosis. RESULTS: The median follow-up in surviving patients was 23.7 months. Twenty-five patients (7.4%) had prior history of CNS disease, with normal CSF pretransplant. Three patients had CSF blasts detected for the first time at pretransplant evaluation (0.88%). The 2-year OS and RFS in groups with and without CNS involvement were not significantly different. Patients with CNS-AML had significantly higher 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse (29.7% vs 16.9%, P = .048). Age more than 65 years and absence of marrow remission at transplant were significant adverse factors for survival. CONCLUSION: CNS-AML is not an independent risk factor for survival after allo-HCT, but can be associated with higher relapse rates. Pretransplant CSF assessment has low yield in detecting new CNS disease pretransplant in AML.","['Prem, Shruti', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Avena, Jose', 'Bautista, Rhida', 'Law, Arjun', 'Lam, Wilson', 'Michelis, Fotios V', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Lipton, Jeffrey Howard', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Kumar, Rajat']","['Prem S', 'Atenafu EG', 'Avena J', 'Bautista R', 'Law A', 'Lam W', 'Michelis FV', 'Kim DDH', 'Viswabandya A', 'Lipton JH', 'Mattsson J', 'Kumar R']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7918-8306', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2956-0848', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4786-5699']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190905,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CNS involvement', 'allogeneic transplant']",2019/08/17 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13314 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Nov;103(5):483-490. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13314.

The most common forms of hematological malignancies that occur in girls and young women and therefore necessitate oncofertility care are acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Aggressive gonadotoxic anticancer regimens including alkylating chemotherapy and total body irradiation are used often in treating girls and young women with hematological malignancies. The risks of gonadotoxicity and subsequent iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency and fertility loss depend mainly on the type and stage of the disease, dose of anticancer therapy as well as the age of the patient at the beginning of treatment. To avoid or at least mitigate the devastating complications of anticancer therapy-induced gonadotoxicity, effective and comprehensive strategies that integrate different options for preserving and restoring fertility ranging from established to experimental strategies should be offered before, during, and after chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach that involves strong coordination and collaboration between hemato-oncologists, gynecologists, reproductive biologists, research scientists, and patient navigators is essential to guarantee high standard of care.","['Salama, M', 'Anazodo, A', 'Woodruff, T K']","['Salama M', 'Anazodo A', 'Woodruff TK']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Feinberg School of Medicine-Northwestern University, Chicago, USA.', ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia; Nelune Cancer Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia; School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Feinberg School of Medicine-Northwestern University, Chicago, USA.

In recent years, many literature report that multiple abnormally expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) can participate in the development of T-ALL by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. For example, overexpression of miR-19 and miR181a can activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which leads to the development of T-ALL and induction of chemotherapy drug resistance, as well as the low expression of miR-26b and miR-29a. Apart from the inhibitors and traditional Chinese medicines that target the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, regulation of the expression of the corresponding miRNA may also be a potential treatment protocol for T-ALL. The mechanisms of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway involved in the development of T-ALL, the role of miRNAs in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the targeted therapy based on this signaling pathway are summarized briefly in this review.","['Li, Yong-Jun', 'Li, Xiao-Fei', 'Yang, Er-Huan', 'Shi, Min']","['Li YJ', 'Li XF', 'Yang EH', 'Shi M']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei Province, China E-mail: lyjj221@sina.com.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1344-04 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.059 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1344-1347. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.059.,20190827,1344-1347,,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', 'MicroRNAs', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 35 patients with newly-diagnosed childhood Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia from March 2011 to September 2017 in Fujian Medical University Union Hospital were retrospectively analyzed and summarized. Among 35 patients, 5 gave up treatment and one patient died of multiple organ failure before treatment, and 29 patients received CCCG-BNHL-2010 protocol chemotherapy. RESULTS: The 35 cases of BL/L includsd 31 males and 4 females (MratioF=7.75ratio1) with the median age of 5(2.0-11) years. Clinically, the common infiltration sites were as follows: abdominal organs (especially ileocecus, 21/35, 60%), bone marrow (21/35, 60%), faciomaxillary (10/35, 28.57%), and central nervous system (8/35, 22.85%). According to St. Jude staging system, 6 patients were grouped into stage , and 8 into stage and 21 into stage , among which the bone marrow blasts of 17 patients were more than 25%. The analysis of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis showed that in median follow up of 23.4 (5.3-86.4) months, 5 patients relapsed (5/29, 17.24%), the median relapsed time was 5.7 (3.9-7.2) months; tow-year overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 79.2%+/-7.6% and 78.3%+/-7.9%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 2-year OS and PFS in patients with LDH2N, stage (bone marrow infiltration), central nervous system infiltration and no-CR after 2 courses of treatnent all were significantly lower than those in patients with LDH</=2N, stage-, without central nervous system infiltration as well as CR after 2 course of treatment (P values were 0.015, 0.015, 0.019 and 0.000, respectively). Cox regression analysis showed that no-CR after 2 course was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (HR 0.34, 95%CI: 0.03-0.407).

METHODS: The effects of different concentration of Rh2 (0, 10 , 20, 40 and 80 microg/ml) on the proliferation activity of Jurkat cells were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method, and the semi-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Rh2 on Jurkat cells at 48 h was calculated. Microscopy and Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining were used to observe the apoptosis of Jurkat cells treated with IC50 Rh2 for 48 h. And then, the cell experiment was divided into 4 groups: control, Rh2 (IC50), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 micromol/l) and Rh2 (IC50) + LY294002 (50 micromol/l). After synchronous culture for 48 h, the apoptosis and cycle changes of Jurkat cells were detected by using PI single staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression level of apoptosis-related protein BAX, BCL-2, Cleaved-Caspasase 3, cell cycle-related protein Cyclin D1 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related protein AKT and p-AKT. RESULTS: Rh2 (10-80 microg/ml) inhibited the Jurkat cell proliferation in a dose-time dependent manner (r48h = 0.999, P0.01; r80 microg/ml = 0.991; P0.05), accompanied by obvious morphological changes of apoptosis cells. Flow cytometry showed that compared with the control group, the cell apoptosis rate in Rh2 or LY294002 group significantly increased, and the cell cycle was mostly blocked in G0/G1 phase. However, the cell apoptosis and cell cycle block in Rh2+LY294002 group were more significant than that in Rh2 and LY294002 group. Western blot showed that compared with the control group, Rh2 significantly promoted the expression of BAX and Cleaved-Caspasase 3, inhibited the expression of BCL-2, Cyclin D1 and p-AKT, furthermore LY294002 significantly promoted this effect. CONCLUSION: Rh2 can induce the apoptosis of Jurkat cells in time-dose dependent manner, moreover, Rh2 also can result in an obvious block of Jurkat cells at G0/G1, that may be closely related to a series of apoptotic signaling cascades mediated by Rh2 inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway.","['Nie, Liu', 'Peng, Han-Ming']","['Nie L', 'Peng HM']",,"[""Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical School, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430000, Hubei Province, China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical School, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430000, Hubei Province, China,E-mail: yhl778@sina.com.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1111-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1111-1117. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.019.,20190827,1111-1117,,"['0 (Ginsenosides)', '78214-33-2 (ginsenoside Rh2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Ginsenosides', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MLL-ALL cell line KOCL44 and KOCL45 were selected as the research object, then the control and experimental groups were set up. The cell survival rate was measured by the trypan blue dye exclusion method, the cell early apoptosis and expression of death receptors on the cell surface were detected by flow cytometry with Annexin-V/PI double staining. The protein level of caspase-8, BID, caspase-3, caspase-9, BAD, BCL-2, as well as mitochondrial and cytosol Cyto-C were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: LBF combined with TRAIL inhibited the growth of KOCL44 and KOCL-45 cells and showed the synergistic effect, the results of flow cytometry with Amnexiu V/PI double staining were consistent with above-mentioned results. After treatment of KOCL44 and KOCL45 cells with LBF plus TRAIL, the significant expression of DR4 on cell surface was not found, while the expression of DR4 receptor was enhanced significantly, the pro-apoptotic proteins including caspase-8, BID, caspase-3, caspase-9 and BAD were activated significantly and BCL-2 was suppressed significantly with time-dependent manner. The expression of mitochondria cyto-C in KOCL44 and KOCL45 decreased along with prolonging of treatment time (r=-0.95, r=-0.866), while the expression of cytosol cyto-C in KOCL44 and KOCL45 increased along with prolonging of treatment time (r=0.883, r=0.903). CONCLUSION: The combination of LBP and TRAIL significantly increases the apoptosis of KOCL44 and KOCL45, and the LBP and TRAIL can up-regulate the expression of TRAIL death receptor-DR5 on the cell surface, activate the pathway of caspase and mito-chrondia mitachondria, thus enhance the sensitivity of KOCL44 and KOCL45 to TRAIL induced apoptosis through both mitochondrial and apoptotic pathway.","['Chen, Cheng', 'Ma, Yu', 'Li, Yi-De', 'Zhang, Xiao-Chun']","['Chen C', 'Ma Y', 'Li YD', 'Zhang XC']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Clinical Laboratorial Center, The General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China,E-mail: sxlipo@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1104-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1104-1110. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.018.,20190827,1104-1110,,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (lycium barbarum polysaccharide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8', '*Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: CCK-8 was used to detect the inhibitory effect of different doses of adriamycin, quercetin and quercetin combined with adriamycin on the proliferation of primary leukemia cells from patients with clinically refractory acute leukemia. Quercetin, adriamycin and their combination were used to treat non-irradiated T-ALL leukemia mice to observe the changes of survival curve and myocardial injury. RESULT: There was no significant difference in the inhibition rate of primary leukemia cell proliferation between the adriamycin concentration group (6, 0.6 and 0.06 mug/ml) and the adriamycin half-dose (3, 0.3 and 0.03 mug/ml) plus quercetin (0.25 mmol/L) group at three different time points (24, 48 and 72 hours). There was a significant difference in the inhibition rate of primary leukemia cell proliferation among the drug concentration groups, and the inhibition rate of primary leukemia cell proliferation was time-and concentration-dependent (r24ha\c\e=0.995r48ha\c\e=1.000r72ha\c\e=0.984r24hb\d\f=0.993r48hb\d\f=0.999r72hb \d\f=0.960). In vivo experiments showed that the survival time of non-irradiated T-ALL leukemia mice treated with low-dose adriamycin combined with quercetin was not significantly prolonged compared with the high-dose adriamycin treatment group. The survival time of non-irradiated T-ALL leukemia mice treated with high dose of adriamycin and quercetin was significantly prolonged (P0.05). Compared with adriamycin group, the SOD activity in adriamycin combined with quercetin group increased significantly and the MDA content decreased. The results of transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the expression of Ighv1-84 and Igkv6-14 in adriamycin combined quercetin group and quercetin group was lower than that in adriamycin group. The Ms4a1, Podx1, Mecom, Sh3bgr12, Bex4 and Tdrp expression in adriamycin combined quercetin group and adriamycin group were higher than that in quercetin group, while Crabp1 expression was lower. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can inhibit the proliferation of primary leukemia cells in a time-dependent manner. Quercetin combined with adriamycin inhibit the proliferation of primary leukemia cells significantly, and had synergistic and additive effects on the proliferation of primary leukemia cells, and the inhibiting effect of quercetin combined with adriamycin is concentration-and time-dependent.

METHODS: HL-60 cells were divided into four groups: control group, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) group, adenanthin group and ATRA+adenanthin group. Cell morphologic changes were observed under optical microscope. The influence of adenanthin on the differentiation of HL-60 was observed by nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) test. Cell surface differentiation antigens CD11b expression was measured by flow cytometry. The protein expression of Prx III was detected by immunohistochemical assay. RESULTS: Adenanthin could induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells; the NBT reduction positive rate in ATRA+adenanthin group was significantly higher than that in ATRA group and adenanthin group (P0.05). The percentage of CD11b positive cells in ATRA+adenanthin group (43.62+/-1.38) was higher than that in adenanthin group (28.15+/-1.78), ATRA group (36.72+/-1.33) and control group (7.99+/-1.78) (P0. 05). The content of Prx protein in adenanthin group was significantly higher than that in control group and ATRA group (P0.05). CONCLUSION: Adenanthin and ATRA have a synergistic effect on the differentiation and maturation of HL-60 cells, and its mechanism may be related with regulation of Prx III expression.","['Mo, Yun-Xi', 'Liu, Dan-Li', 'Gao, Shun-Li', 'Yin, Xiao-Cheng']","['Mo YX', 'Liu DL', 'Gao SL', 'Yin XC']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan Province, China,E-mail: xcyin108@sina.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1083-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1083-1087. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.015.,20190827,1083-1087,,"['0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (adenanthin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin III)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Peroxiredoxin III', 'Tretinoin']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The bone marrow samples of 223 patients with newly diagnosed AML confirmed by MICM typing from January 2015 to October 2018 were collected. The mutation of exon 4 of IDH2 gene was detected by direct sequancing of PCR product; the incidence and types of IDH2 gene mutation in AML patients were analyzed; the clinical characteristics of AML patients with IDH2 gene mutation were analyzed and the therapeutic efficacy for these patients was evaluated. RESULTS: In a cohort of 223 AML patients, mutations were detected in 23(10.31) patients, among them, 15 with R140Q mutations(65.22%) , 6 with R172K mutations(26.09%) and 2 with R140W mutations(8.70%). The median age in IDH2 mutated group was older than that in non.mutated group(P=0.008). The platelet level at initial diagnosis in IDH2 mutated group was higher than that in non.mutated group(P=0.010). There was no significant statistical difference between IDH2 mutated group and non.mutated group in FAB subtypes of AML(P>0.05). But the rate of IDH2 mutation in M4 and M5 was higher. The rate of IDH2 mutations was higher in AML with normal karyotype and in AML with NPM1 mutations. R140Q mutations associated with NPM1 mutations(chi(2)=8.481P=0.004), but R172K mutations not associated with NPM1 mutation(P>0.05). IDH2 mutated patients had a lower complete remission rate than non.mutated patients(57.14% vs 80.46%, chi(2)=5.927P=0.015). The complete remission rate of R140Q mutated patients was not significantly statistically different from non.mutated patients. The complete remission rate of R172K mutated patients was very significantly lower than non.mutated patients(chi(2)=7.734P=0.005). In the patients without NPM1 mutation, the 2 years overall survival in IDH2 mutated group was lower than in non.mutated group(36.36% vs 66.40%,chi(2)=3.958P=0.047), the 2 years overall survival of R172K mutated group was significantly lower than non.mutated group(although P>0.05). In all patients, the 2 years overall survival between IDH2 mutated group and non.mutated group was not statistically different(50% vs 66.88%,P>0.05), the 2 years overall survival of R172K mutated group was significantly lower than non.mutated group(although P>0.05). In the patients with normal karyotype or with mutated NPM1, the 2 years overall survival between IDH2 mutated group and non.mutated group was not statistically different(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: IDH2 gene mutations are more common in AML patients at older age, higher platelets level and normal karyotype. The rate of IDH2 mutation in M4 and M5 is higher. IDH2 gene mutations associate with NPMl gene mutations, but R172K mutations not associates with NPM1mutation. IDH2 gene mutations associate with prognosis of AML patients, R140Q mutations have no effect on prognosis of patients, but R172K mutations may be the molecular markers for poor prognosis in AML patients.","['Luo, Li-Qing', 'Peng, Zhen-Yi', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Yu, Wen-Zheng']","['Luo LQ', 'Peng ZY', 'Liu X', 'Yu WZ']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical College, Binzhou 256603, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Thyroid & Breast Surgery,, Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical College, Binzhou 256603, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical College, Binzhou 256603, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical College, Binzhou 256603, Shandong Province, China,E-mail: yuwenzheng2009@163.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1077-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1077-1082. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.014.,20190827,1077-1082,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Genotype', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 218 children with newly diagnosed ALL who achieveal the complete remission and had the complete follow-up information were selected, and the expression level of CRLF2 in bone marrow mononuclear cells of these children was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, and the significance of CRLF2 expression level in clinical prognosis of ALL children was analyzed by using statistical method. RESULTS: 28 cases in 218 children with complete data showed high expression of CRLF2. The cumulative recurrence rate in the CRLF2 high expression group was significantly higher than that in the low expression group (53.6% vs 12.6%) (P0.01). The predicted 5-year recurrence-free survival rate (RFS) of ALL children with CRLF2 high expression was significantly higher than that of low expression group (P0.01).

There was no significant difference in the expression of LAMP1, TPC1 and TPC2 between CD34(+)HSC of patients with AML and relapsed/refractory patients (P>0.05). No correlation was found between age, sex and genotype and expression of membrane proteins (P>0.05). The expression levels of LAMP1 and TPC1 positively correlated with the number of white blood cells in peripheral blood of patients (P<0.01). LAMP1 and TPC2 were found to be associated with remission after a course of chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients. Initially treated patients with high expression of LAMP1 in the bone marrow not easily relieved after one course of chemotherapy. Patients with high expression of TPC2 in the bone marrow more likely to be relieved after one course of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The mRNA of the three membrane proteins are highly expressed in AML patients, and LAMP1 and TPC1 are risk factors for AML disease progression. High expression of TPC2 is beneficial for chemotherapy of patients with newly diagnosed AML.","['Wang, Xiang', 'Ling, Bing-Qian', 'Dai, Mei-Fang', 'Wang, Xing-Bing']","['Wang X', 'Ling BQ', 'Dai MF', 'Wang XB']",,"['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University,Hefei 230000, Anhui Province, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei 230000, Anhui Province, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei 230000, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University,Hefei 230000, Anhui Province, China,E-mail: wangxingbing91@ hotmail.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1046-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1046-1052. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.009.,20190827,1046-1052,,"['0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 7 patients with B-cell ALL relapsed after allo-HSCT were treated with CD19 CAR-T cells from September 2015 to March 2018. Among them, 6 had hematological recurrence and 1 had positive of MRD. They all were treated with a single infusion of CAR-T cells. FC chemotherapy regimen was administered before transfusion. The median number of CAR-T cells transfused was 6.0 (range 4.0-8.6) )x10(6)/kg. Long-term efficacy and toxicity were evaluated. RESULTS: Bone marrow examination performed at d 30 after CAR-T infusion showed that all 7 patients achieved complete remission and MRD negative, grade I CRS for 1 case and grade II CRS for 6 cases, two of them had mild neurotoxicity, which was controlled by treatment. Two patients presented grade VI intestinal GVHD after CAR-T infusion. The median follow-up time was 18 months (range 12-42). Follow-up showed that two patients relapsed at 9 months and 14 months after treatment, out of 2 patients one died of progressive disease and the other reachived the hematological remission, but MRD was positive after CD22 CAR-T cell therapy. At present, five patients are disease-free survival, moreover showed complete donor chimerism. One year after CAR-T cell therapy, the results of immune reconstitution showed that CD4 level was more than 300x10(6)/L in 5 patients who disease-free survived. Among them, 3 patients had poor recovery of immunoglobulin and received gamma globulin replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: All patients are followed up for at least one year. The preliminary efficacy and safety are satisfactory. CAR-T cell infusion is an effective method for the treatment of B-ALL recurrence after allo-HSCT.","['Chen, Hui-Ren', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Chen, Peng', 'Liu, Xiao-Dong', 'Huang, Qing', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Li, Hui-Min', 'Liu, Bing']","['Chen HR', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen P', 'Liu XD', 'Huang Q', 'Zhang J', 'Li HM', 'Liu B']",,"['Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China,E-mail: chenhui-ren@medmail.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Seventh Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100700, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1040-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1040-1045. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.008.,20190827,1040-1045,,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, interference of NPM gene could prolong G0/G1 phase and arrest cell cycle, which may be related to the down-regulation of NPM gene expression and activation of p21 protein expression, thereby inhibited the formation of CDK2/ Cyclin E complex. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of NPM gene expression in K562 cells can induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit cell proliferation.","['Lin, Min-Hui', 'Zheng, Zhi-Hong', 'Jiang, Pei-Fang', 'Wu, Zheng-Jun', 'Gan, Dong-Hui', 'Zhang, Na', 'Hu, Jian-Da']","['Lin MH', 'Zheng ZH', 'Jiang PF', 'Wu ZJ', 'Gan DH', 'Zhang N', 'Hu JD']",,"['Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China,E-mail: drjiandahu@163.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1008-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1008-1012. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.003.,20190827,1008-1012,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleophosmin']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Methylation status of the CHD5 gene promoter was detected by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSPCR) in bone marrow from AML patients, and the iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) samples were served as control. The expression of CHD5, p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The methylation of CHD5 gene in bone marrow from AML patients increased significantly (39.06%) as compared with control group (6.67%). The methylation of CHD5 gene significantly correlated with chromosome karyotype differentiation (P0.01), but did not correlate with the patient's sex, age and clinical classification (P0.05). The mRNA expression of CHD5 gene in AML decreased, compared with control group, the mRNA and protein expression of p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) in AML with CHD5 methylation promoter decreased. CONCLUSION: The hypermeltylation of CHD5 gene promoter in AML patients can lead to decrease of CHD5, p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) expression levels which may reduce the inhibitory effect on proliferation of leukemia cells through the regulation of p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) pathway, thus promotes the occurence of AML.","['Wu, Ming-Cai', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Dong, Ting', 'Lv, Jun', 'Fang, Ji-Yong', 'Xu, Lei', 'Wei, Zhong-Ling', 'Zhang, Yao']","['Wu MC', 'Jiang M', 'Dong T', 'Lv J', 'Fang JY', 'Xu L', 'Wei ZL', 'Zhang Y']",,"['Department of Biochemistry of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China,Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China.', 'Wuhu Second Sanatorium for Retired Cadres, Anhui Military Area, Wuhu 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Encephalopathy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Anhui, Hefei 230031, Anhui ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Biochemistry of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China,Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China,Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China,Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, Anhui Province, China,E-mail: zhangyao@ahedu.gov.cn.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)04-1001-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;27(4):1001-1007. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.04.002.,20190827,1001-1007,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (CHD5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA Helicases', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 10 patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis admitted in Chinese PLA General Hospital from June 2011 to May 2018 were collected, and their clinical features, laboratorial data and long-term survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of these 10 cases was 32.5 (23-73) years old. Nine cases had chronic phase history. The median chronic phase was 17(4-84) months. All the 10 cases had splenomegaly; B-ultrasonography showed that the median spleen size was 5.2 (4-7.8) cm in thickness, and 14.6 (11.4-19.8) in length. When chronic myeloid leukemia was in blast crisis, the median WBC count was 41.70511.9-344.41x10(9) /L and the median platelet count was 159 (13-2326) x10(9) /L. The Ph+ chromosome and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene coulld be detected in all the cases. The chromosome karyotyping showed that additional chromosome abnormalities were found in 5 cases. One case was of low diploid, and two cases were with complex karyotype. ABL1 mutation was detected in 6 out of these 10 cases. ABL1 T315I mutation was detected in 2 of them and one was with deletion of combined P53 in genetic tests. The median follow-up time was 10.5(0.2-78) months. There were 5 cases treated sequentially by chemotheraphy with or without TKI and allo-HSCT. Three cases reached CP2 before transplantation. Among them, two cases still survived without progression for 67 months and 69 months after the transplantation respectively. One case died of transplantation-related mortality (suffered from cerebral hemorrhage 7 months after the transplantation). Two cases were NR before the transplantation, and both died of disease relapse or progression at the time points of one or three months after the transplantation. Five cases treated by TKI +/- chemotheraphy and without HSCT succumbed to disease progression. The median time was 6(0.2-22) months.

Genomic profiling of AML has greatly enhanced our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic landscape of this high-risk leukemia. With it comes the opportunity to develop targeted therapies that are expected to be more effective and less toxic than current treatment regimens. Nevertheless, often overlooked in leukemia drug discovery are the dynamic interactions between leukemic cells and the bone marrow environment. The interplay between leukemic cells, stromal cells and the extracellular matrix plays critical roles in the development, progression and relapse of AML as well as in drug response and the development of resistance. Here we will review pediatric leukemia with a special focus on acute myeloid disease in children, and discuss the tumor microenvironment in the context of drug resistance and leukemia stem cell survival. We will emphasize how three-dimensional (3D) cell-based drug discovery may offer hope for both the identification and advancement of more effective treatment options for patients suffering from this devastating disease.","['Cartledge Wolf, Donna M', 'Langhans, Sigrid A']","['Cartledge Wolf DM', 'Langhans SA']",,"['Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, United States.', 'Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, United States.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103464/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA191077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM104941/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190730,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC6682595,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'bone marrow', 'leukemia', 'three-dimensional cell culture', 'tumor microenvironment']",2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/17 06:01,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2019.00314 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Jul 30;7:314. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00314. eCollection 2019.,,314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, capillary leakage syndrome, which is associated with endothelial cells damage, is under intensive focus in CART123 therapy. Purpose: The present study aimed to explore the change in CD123 in endothelial cells and the injury to endothelial cells caused by CART123. Methods: The expression of CD123 and cytotoxicity were assessed by flow cytometry. Cytokine release was assessed by ELISA. An in vitro co-culture model was designed to mimic the status, wherein CART123 was stimulated and cytokines were released. Results: In the current study, CART123 exhibited cytotoxicity and the effects of cytokine production on endothelium, and the upregulation of CD123 enhanced the cytotoxicity. The addition of interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha neutralizing antibodies can effectively reverse the upregulation of CD123 on the endothelial cells caused by CART123, while the cytotoxicity of CART123 in AML cell lines was not affected in vitro. Second, we proved that CD123 expresses in CART123 and would be upregulated after activation, putatively causing an overactivated and fratricide effect. Conclusion: In summary, this study identified that the expression of CD123 on endothelial cells could be upregulated when co-cultured with CART123. Furthermore, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha could aggravate endothelial damage caused by CART123 in vitro.","['Sun, Yao', 'Wang, Shenyu', 'Zhao, Long', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Chen, Hu']","['Sun Y', 'Wang S', 'Zhao L', 'Zhang B', 'Chen H']",,"[""Academy of Military Medical Sciences , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), the Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Academy of Military Medical Sciences , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), the Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), the Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), the Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), the Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research , Beijing 100071, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190624,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6600319,['NOTNLM'],"['CD123', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'capillary leak syndrome', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'endothelium']",2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/17 06:01,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S205678 [doi]', '205678 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jun 24;12:4907-4925. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S205678. eCollection 2019.,,4907-4925,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we further determined SOX30 methylation and its clinical significance in the other myeloid malignance - chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Methods: SOX30 methylation was examined by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR, whereas SOX30 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: SOX30 methylation was identified in 11% (10/95) CML patients. SOX30 methylation was associated with lower hemoglobin and platelets (P=0.006 and 0.032, respectively). Importantly, significant differences were observed in the distributions of clinical stages and cytogenetics (P=0.006 and 0.002, respectively). The frequency of SOX30 methylation in chronic phase (CP) stage occurred with lowest frequency (4/74, 5%), higher in accelerated phase (AP) stage (1/7, 14%), and the highest in blast crisis (BC) stage (12/31, 39%). In addition, SOX30 methylated patients tended to have a higher level of BCR-ABL transcript than SOX30 non-methylated patients (P=0.063). In two paired CML patients, SOX30 methylation showed lower density in CP stage (19% and 17%, respectively), and was significantly increased in BC stage (89% and 69%, respectively) during disease progression. Additionally, SOX30 methylated CML patients presented a lower SOX30 transcript level than SOX30 non-methylated CML patients (P=0.046).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequently detected pathogen in the respiratory tract of COPD patients during an exacerbation. We previously demonstrated in a murine model that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression was increased in the lungs during RSV infection. Subduing LIF signaling in this model enhanced lung injury and airway hypersensitivity. In this study, we investigated lung LIF levels in COPD patient samples to determine the impact of disease status and cigarette smoke exposure on LIF expression. Materials and methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from healthy never smokers, smokers, and COPD patients, by written informed consent. Human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were isolated from healthy never smokers and COPD patients, grown at the air-liquid interface and infected with RSV or stimulated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly (i:c)). Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke daily for 6 months and were subsequently infected with RSV. LIF expression was profiled in all samples. Results: In human BALF, LIF protein was significantly reduced in both smokers and COPD patients compared to healthy never smokers. HBE cells isolated from COPD patients produced less LIF compared to never smokers during RSV infection or poly (i:c) stimulation. Animals exposed to cigarette smoke had reduced lung levels of LIF and its corresponding receptor, LIFR. Smoke-exposed animals had reduced LIF expression during RSV infection. Two possible factors for reduced LIF levels were increased LIF mRNA instability in COPD epithelia and proteolytic degradation of LIF protein by serine proteases. Conclusions: Cigarette smoke is an important modulator for LIF expression in the lungs. Loss of LIF expression in COPD could contribute to a higher degree of lung injury during virus-associated exacerbations.","['Poon, Justin', 'Campos, Michael', 'Foronjy, Robert F', 'Nath, Sridesh', 'Gupta, Gayatri', 'Railwah, Christopher', 'Dabo, Abdoulaye J', 'Baumlin, Nathalie', 'Salathe, Matthias', 'Geraghty, Patrick']","['Poon J', 'Campos M', 'Foronjy RF', 'Nath S', 'Gupta G', 'Railwah C', 'Dabo AJ', 'Baumlin N', 'Salathe M', 'Geraghty P']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0411-4665', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5485-9062', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3964-5335', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7996-8820', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1369-5425', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2474-8171', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5127-1498', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5341-6785', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9092-4861', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1647-5505']","['Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 HL139365/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20190618,New Zealand,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,101273481,PMC6592033,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', '*cigarette smoke', '*leukemia inhibitory factor', '*respiratory syncytial virus']",2019/08/17 06:00,2020/02/08 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/COPD.S196658 [doi]', '196658 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis. 2019 Jun 18;14:1305-1315. doi: 10.2147/COPD.S196658. eCollection 2019.,20200207,1305-1315,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Smoke)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology', '*Cigarette Smoking/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*analysis', 'Mice', '*Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/immunology/pathology', '*Respiratory Mucosa/immunology/pathology', '*Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/immunology/pathology', 'Smoke/*adverse effects', 'Symptom Flare Up', 'Tobacco/*adverse effects']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate an innovative leukemia model based on 100% pure MLL-AF4 or -AF9 rearranged cells derived from umbilical cord blood with indefinite growth in cell culture systems. Our model shared phenotypical, morphological and molecular features of patient cells faithfully mimicking the nature of the disease. Thus, it serves as a fundamental basis for pharmacological studies: inhibition of histone methyltransferase disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) is one specific therapeutic approach currently tested in clinical trials. However, success was limited by restricted response warranting further investigation of drug combinations. Recently, it has been shown that the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) exhibits anti-tumoral activity against human cell lines and in MLL mouse models. Here, we used DOT1L and PRMT5 inhibitors in our human MLL-rearranged model demonstrating dose-dependent reduced proliferation, impairment of cell cycle, increasing differentiation, apoptosis, downregulation of target genes and sensitization to chemotherapy. Strikingly, the combination of both compounds led to synergistic anti-tumoral effects. Our study provides a strong rationale for novel targeted combination therapies to improve the outcome of MLL-rearranged leukemias.","['Secker, Kathy-Ann', 'Keppeler, Hildegard', 'Duerr-Stoerzer, Silke', 'Schmid, Hannes', 'Schneidawind, Dominik', 'Hentrich, Thomas', 'Schulze-Hentrich, Julia M', 'Mankel, Barbara', 'Fend, Falko', 'Schneidawind, Corina']","['Secker KA', 'Keppeler H', 'Duerr-Stoerzer S', 'Schmid H', 'Schneidawind D', 'Hentrich T', 'Schulze-Hentrich JM', 'Mankel B', 'Fend F', 'Schneidawind C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5496-293X'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University of Tuebingen and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University of Tuebingen and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany. corina.schneidawind@med.uni-tuebingen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190815,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0937-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0937-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Nov;38(46):7181-7195. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0937-9.

Hypoxic regions within tumors represent sources of aggressiveness and resistance to therapy. Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as major gene expression regulators, their regulation and function following hypoxic stress are still largely unexplored. Combining profiling studies on early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) biopsies and on A549 LUAD cell lines cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that are both correlated with the hypoxic status of tumors and regulated by hypoxia in vitro. We focused on a new transcript, NLUCAT1, which is strongly upregulated by hypoxia in vitro and correlated with hypoxic markers and poor prognosis in LUADs. Full molecular characterization showed that NLUCAT1 is a large nuclear transcript composed of six exons and mainly regulated by NF-kappaB and NRF2 transcription factors. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated invalidation of NLUCAT1 revealed a decrease in proliferative and invasive properties, an increase in oxidative stress and a higher sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis of NLUCAT1-deficient cells showed repressed genes within the antioxidant and/or cisplatin-response networks. We demonstrated that the concomitant knockdown of four of these genes products, GPX2, GLRX, ALDH3A1, and PDK4, significantly increased ROS-dependent caspase activation, thus partially mimicking the consequences of NLUCAT1 inactivation in LUAD cells. Overall, we demonstrate that NLUCAT1 contributes to an aggressive phenotype in early-stage hypoxic tumors, suggesting it may represent a new potential therapeutic target in LUADs.","['Moreno Leon, Laura', 'Gautier, Marine', 'Allan, Richard', 'Ilie, Marius', 'Nottet, Nicolas', 'Pons, Nicolas', 'Paquet, Agnes', 'Lebrigand, Kevin', 'Truchi, Marin', 'Fassy, Julien', 'Magnone, Virginie', 'Kinnebrew, Garrett', 'Radovich, Milan', 'Cheok, Meyling Hua-Chen', 'Barbry, Pascal', 'Vassaux, Georges', 'Marquette, Charles-Hugo', 'Ponzio, Gilles', 'Ivan, Mircea', 'Pottier, Nicolas', 'Hofman, Paul', 'Mari, Bernard', 'Rezzonico, Roger']","['Moreno Leon L', 'Gautier M', 'Allan R', 'Ilie M', 'Nottet N', 'Pons N', 'Paquet A', 'Lebrigand K', 'Truchi M', 'Fassy J', 'Magnone V', 'Kinnebrew G', 'Radovich M', 'Cheok MH', 'Barbry P', 'Vassaux G', 'Marquette CH', 'Ponzio G', 'Ivan M', 'Pottier N', 'Hofman P', 'Mari B', 'Rezzonico R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2014-1236', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9632-6483', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0422-9182']","[""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS, INSERM, IRCAN, Nice, France."", 'Hospital-Related Biobank (BB-0033-00025), Pasteur Hospital, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'INSERM UMR-S1172, Institute for Cancer Research of Lille, Factors of Leukemia Cell Persistence, Lille, Cedex, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS, INSERM, IRCAN, Nice, France."", 'Department of Pneumology, CHU-Nice, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', 'Department of Medicine and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'EA4483, Faculte de Medecine de Lille, Pole Recherche, Lille, France.', 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS, INSERM, IRCAN, Nice, France."", 'Hospital-Related Biobank (BB-0033-00025), Pasteur Hospital, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France. mari@unice.fr."", 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France. mari@unice.fr.', 'FHU-OncoAge, Nice, France. rezzonico@ipmc.cnrs.fr.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, CNRS UMR7275, IPMC, Valbonne, France. rezzonico@ipmc.cnrs.fr.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190815,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0935-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0935-y [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Nov;38(46):7146-7165. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0935-y.

Although patient outcomes have improved, novel targeted therapies are needed to reduce the intensity of chemotherapy and improve the prognosis of high-risk patients. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) modulates the survival and proliferation of normal and malignant T cells. Targeting the IL-7 signaling pathway is thus a potentially effective therapeutic strategy. To achieve such aim, it is essential to first understand how the IL-7 signaling pathway is activated. Although IL-7 production has been observed from multiple stromal tissues, T-ALL autocrine IL-7 secretion has not yet been described. Interestingly, using T-ALL cell lines, primary and patient-derived xenotransplanted (PDX) T-ALL cells, we demonstrate that T-ALL cells produce IL-7 whereas normal T cells do not. Finally, using knock down of IL7 gene in T-ALL cells, we describe to what extent IL-7 autocrine secretion is involved in the T-ALL cells propagation in bone marrow and how it affects the number of leukemia-initiating cells in PDX mice. Together, these results demonstrate how the autocrine production of the IL-7 cytokine mediated by T-ALL cells can be involved in the oncogenic development of T-ALL and offer novel insights into T-ALL spreading.","['Buffiere, Anne', 'Uzan, Benjamin', 'Aucagne, Romain', 'Hermetet, Francois', 'Mas, Manon', 'Nassurdine, Sandra', 'Aznague, Aziza', 'Carmignac, Virginie', 'Tournier, Benjamin', 'Bouchot, Olivier', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Bastie, Jean-Noel', 'Delva, Laurent', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Quere, Ronan']","['Buffiere A', 'Uzan B', 'Aucagne R', 'Hermetet F', 'Mas M', 'Nassurdine S', 'Aznague A', 'Carmignac V', 'Tournier B', 'Bouchot O', 'Ballerini P', 'Barata JT', 'Bastie JN', 'Delva L', 'Pflumio F', 'Quere R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4826-8976', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1615-6769']","['UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'UMR967, Inserm/CEA/Universite Paris 7/Universite Paris 11, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'LSHL, IRCM/CEA, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'Hopital Universitaire Francois Mitterrand, Service de Genetique des Cancers, Dijon, France.', 'Hopital Universitaire Francois Mitterrand, Chirurgie Cardiovasculaire, Dijon, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Trousseau, Paris, France."", 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', ""Hopital Universitaire Francois Mitterrand, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Dijon, France."", 'Hopital Universitaire Francois Mitterrand, CRB Ferdinand Cabanne, BB-0033-00044, Dijon, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'UMR967, Inserm/CEA/Universite Paris 7/Universite Paris 11, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'LSHL, IRCM/CEA, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'UMR1231, Inserm/Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France. ronan.quere@inserm.fr.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France. ronan.quere@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190815,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0921-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0921-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Nov;38(48):7357-7365. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0921-4.

We retrospectively analyzed 259 APL patients from 2002 to 2014 who all received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with the support of sufficient transfusions, followed by 4 days of idarubicin. High-risk status was determined as a diagnostic leukocyte count (WBCdx) >10 x 10(9)/L (Sanz criteria). For patients with hyperleukocytosis, we sometimes conducted leukapheresis and also used hydroxyurea and prophylactic dexamethasone. Because we frequently observed patient fatalities from progressive hyperleukocytosis, we also checked the maximum leukocyte count (WBCmax) and stratified patients by their incremental ratios. The 8-week cumulative incidence of early death and DS was 13.5% and 17.8%, respectively. We found that WBCmax correlated better with early death and DS, even in the low-risk group, than WBCdx. Among the patients with WBCdx <10 x 10(9)/L, a WBCmax >43 x 10(9)/L correlated with early death (26.7%) and DS (40.0%). Also, having a WBCdx of 10 to 43 x 10(9)/La that increased to a WBCmax >43 x 10(9)/L correlated with increased early death (33.3%).

Together with candidiasis and aspergillosis, it is one of the most significant fungal infection that carries a high rate of mortality. Early detection and initiation of antifungal therapy with adequate surgical debridement improves the clinical outcome. CASE REPORT We describe a case of mucormycosis in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia who developed disseminated lung disease with muscular involvement without any cutaneous manifestation. Successful treatment was achieved with surgical debridement, amphotericin B lipid-complex and posaconazole step-down therapy. CONCLUSIONS Mucormycosis can present in various clinical scenarios. Key to diagnosis depends on tissues diagnosis from the affected system, as was done with lung and muscle biopsy in our patient.

Alternations in amino acid metabolism are 1 modality for satisfying those demands. Amino acids are not only components of proteins but also intermediate metabolites fueling multiple biosynthetic pathways. Amino acid-depletion therapies target amino acid uptake and catabolism using heterologous enzymes or recombinant or engineered human enzymes. Notably, such therapies have minimal effect on normal cells due to their lower demand for amino acids compared with tumor cells and their ability to synthesize the targeted amino acids under conditions of nutrient stress. Here, we review novel aspects of amino acid metabolism in hematologic malignancies and deprivation strategies, focusing on 4 key amino acids: arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and cysteine. We also present the roles of amino acid metabolism in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and in drug resistance. This summary also offers an argument for the reclassification of amino acid-depleting enzymes as targeted therapeutic agents.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Tabe Y', 'Lorenzi PL', 'Konopleva M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3734-0346', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0385-7774', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9347-2212']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Next Generation Hematology Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA206210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190815,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6764269,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2020/01/31 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)70786-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001034 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Sep 26;134(13):1014-1023. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001034.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy. Dasatinib is a novel tyrosine-kinase inhibitor approved for CML with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and the most common adverse effects of dasatinib are peripheral edema and pleural effusion, which sometimes impose the interruption or reduction of dosage of dasatinib treatment, accompanied by diuretic and steroid use. The goal of CML treatment is maintaining hematological control in the long term by controlling these side effects. The aim of this study is to clarify the efficacy of tolvaptan in treating dasatinib-induced fluid retention. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed six CML patients who received tolvaptan for dasatinib-induced fluid retention. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 60.5+/-11.5 years old, and the mean dosage of dasatinib and tolvaptan were 58.3+/-20.4mg/day and 5.0+/-1.9mg/day, respectively. Tolvaptan was introduced 564.5+/-369.9 days after dasatinib was introduced. Ejection fraction (EF) by echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels did not change. However, the diastolic function significantly changed [E/e' of the septal side: from 20.3+/-2.3 to 16.5+/-4.2, of the lateral side: from 15.0+/-2.1 to 12.5+/-3.8 (p<0.05, respectively)]. New York Heart Association functional class was improved from 3.3+/-0.5 to 1.5 +/- 1.2 (p<0.01) and the grades of fluid retention were also improved. Three patients discontinued dasatinib, and two patients could restart the administration of dasatinib after controlling fluid retention. Five patients could control fluid retention and they could continue with dasatinib therapy without any complications. CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan may be useful in fluid control in patients with CML treated with dasatinib.","['Aoyama, Rie', 'Ishikawa, Joji', 'Harada, Kazumasa']","['Aoyama R', 'Ishikawa J', 'Harada K']",,"['Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

Flow cytometry is the preferred method for the immunophenotypic characterization of leukemia and lymphoma, being able to process and register multiparametric data about tens of thousands of cells per second. METHODS: The proposed decision-tree is composed by logistic function nodes that branch throughout the tree into sets of (possible) distinct leukemia/lymphoma diagnoses. To avoid overfitting, regularization via the Lasso algorithm was used. The code can be run online at https://codeocean.com/2018/03/08/a-decision-tree-approach-for-the-differential-di agnosis-of-chronic-lymphoid-leukemias-and-peripheral-b-cell-lymphomas/ or downloaded from https://github.com/lauramoraes/bioinformatics-sourcecode to be executed in Matlab. RESULTS: The proposed approach was validated in diagnostic peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 283 mature lymphoid leukemias/lymphomas patients. The proposed approach achieved 95% correctness in the cross-validation test phase (100% in-sample), 61% giving a single diagnosis and 34% (possible) multiple disease diagnoses. Similar results were obtained in an out-of-sample validation dataset. The generated tree reached the final diagnoses after up to seven decision nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Here we propose a decision-tree approach for the differential diagnosis of mature lymphoid leukemias/lymphomas which proved to be accurate during out-of-sample validation. The full process is accomplished through seven binary transparent decision nodes.","['Moraes, L O', 'Pedreira, C E', 'Barrena, S', 'Lopez, A', 'Orfao, A']","['Moraes LO', 'Pedreira CE', 'Barrena S', 'Lopez A', 'Orfao A']",,"['Rua Horacio Macedo 2030, Rio de Janeiro/RJ, CEP: 21941-914, Brazil.

METHODS: A total of 892 children with ALL who underwent chemotherapy with the CCLG-ALL 2008 regimen were enrolled. According to the platelet count at diagnosis, these children were divided into normal platelet count group (platelet count >/=100x109/L; n=263) and thrombocytopenia group (platelet count <100x10(9)/L; n=629). The thrombocytopenia group was further divided into (50- <100)x10(9)/L (n=243), (20- <50)x10(9)/L (n=263), and <20x10(9)/L (n=123) subgroups. The association of clinical features (sex, age, immunophenotype, and molecular biology) with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the thrombocytopenia group, the normal platelet count group had significantly lower positive rate of MLL gene rearrangement and recurrence rate (P<0.05), as well as a significantly higher 10-year EFS rate (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in 10-year OS between the two groups (P>0.05). The normal platelet count group still had a significantly higher 10-year EFS rate than the thrombocytopenia group after the children with MLL gene rearrangement were excluded (P<0.05), and there was still no significant difference in 10-year OS between the two groups (P>0.05). The <20x10(9)/L subgroup had significantly lower 10-year EFS and OS rates than the normal platelet count group, the (50- <100)x10(9)/L subgroup, and the (20- <50)x10(9)/L subgroup (P<0.05). After the children with MLL gene rearrangement were excluded, the <20x10(9)/L subgroup still had significantly lower 10-year EFS and OS rates than the normal platelet count group, the (50-<100)x10(9)/L subgroup, and the (20- <50)x10(9)/L subgroup (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ALL children with MLL gene rearrangement often have the clinical manifestation of thrombocytopenia. Platelet level at diagnosis is associated with the prognosis of ALL children. The children with normal platelet count have a low recurrence rate and good prognosis, and those with a platelet count of <20x10(9)/L have the worst prognosis.","['Zhang, Ao-Li', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Zou, Yao', 'Yang, Wen-Yu', 'Guo, Ye', 'Wang, Shu-Chun', 'Zhang, Li', 'Liu, Xiao-Ming', 'Ruan, Min', 'Liu, Tian-Feng', 'Qi, Ben-Quan', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Zhang AL', 'Chen XJ', 'Zou Y', 'Yang WY', 'Guo Y', 'Wang SC', 'Zhang L', 'Liu XM', 'Ruan M', 'Liu TF', 'Qi BQ', 'Zhu XF']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China. xfzhu1981@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,PMC7389902,,,2019/08/17 06:00,2019/08/27 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2019.08.006 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Aug;21(8):766-771.,20190826,766-771,,,IM,"['Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although various measures have been taken to avoid toxicity from high serum MTX concentrations, there are many cases of delayed elimination of MTX. Objective: We suspected that delayed elimination of serum MTX was caused by unknown interactions between MTX and concomitant drugs. Methods: Concerning concomitant drugs in the case of delayed elimination of MTX, we performed screening tests in 35 patients who had undergone HD-MTX therapy. We then investigated the risk factors for delayed MTX elimination in 94 patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or osteosarcoma retrospectively. Results: The percentages of concomitant use of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC), a glycyrrhizin preparation, and vincristine were higher in the delayed group. The percentage of delayed MTX elimination in patients receiving HD-MTX therapy was 41%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the concomitant use of SNMC solely was a significant risk factor for delayed MTX (odds ratio = 12.20; 95% CI = 1.06-139.84). Conclusion and Relevance: Concomitant use of SNMC was shown to be related to delayed elimination of serum MTX, and our results suggested a previously unknown drug-drug interaction between MTX and SNMC.","['Ishizaki, Junko', 'Nakano, Chihiro', 'Kitagawa, Kana', 'Suga, Yukio', 'Sai, Yoshimichi']","['Ishizaki J', 'Nakano C', 'Kitagawa K', 'Suga Y', 'Sai Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5002-3513'],"['Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190815,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Stronger Neo-Minophagen C', '*delayed elimination', '*glycyrrhizin', '*methotrexate', '*risk factor']",2019/08/17 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1060028019870445 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2020 Jan;54(1):29-35. doi: 10.1177/1060028019870445.

This last aspect has been developed, especially for certain types of cancers, thanks also to the introduction of new concepts such as liquid biopsies and precision medicine. In this context, there is a growing interest in the application of alternative and noninvasive methodologies to search for cancer biomarkers. The new frontiers of the research lead to a search for RNA molecules circulating in body fluids. Searching for biomarkers in extracellular body fluids represents a better option for patients because they are easier to access, less painful, and potentially more economical. Moreover, the possibility for these types of samples to be taken repeatedly, allows a better monitoring of the disease progression or treatment efficacy for a better intervention and dynamic treatment of the patient, which is the fundamental basis of personalized medicine. RNA molecules, freely circulating in body fluids or packed in microvesicles, have all the characteristics of the ideal biomarkers owing to their high stability under storage and handling conditions and being able to be sampled several times for monitoring. Moreover, as demonstrated for many cancers, their plasma/serum levels mirror those in the primary tumor. There are a large variety of RNA species noncoding for proteins that could be used as cancer biomarkers in liquid biopsies. Among them, the most studied are microRNAs, but recently the attention of the researcher has been also directed towards Piwi-interacting RNAs, circular RNAs, and other small noncoding RNAs. Another class of RNA species, the long noncoding RNAs, is larger than microRNAs and represents a very versatile and promising group of molecules which, apart from their use as biomarkers, have also a possible therapeutic role. In this review, we will give an overview of the most common noncoding RNA species detectable in extracellular fluids and will provide an update concerning the situation of the research on these molecules as cancer biomarkers.","['Pardini, Barbara', 'Sabo, Alexandru Anton', 'Birolo, Giovanni', 'Calin, George Adrian']","['Pardini B', 'Sabo AA', 'Birolo G', 'Calin GA']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9571-4257'],"['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. barbara.pardini@iigm.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy. barbara.pardini@iigm.it.', 'Unit of Molecular Epidemiology and Exposome, Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine (IIGM), 10126 Turin, Italy. barbara.pardini@iigm.it.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Marie Curie Emergency Clinical Hospital for Children, 077120 Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Unit of Molecular Epidemiology and Exposome, Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine (IIGM), 10126 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. gcalin@mdanderson.org.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. gcalin@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. gcalin@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['./Estate of C.

The alpha4beta1 integrin receptor is a therapeutic target for inflammation, autoimmune diseases and lymphoid tumors. This study was carried out to search through the antagonists-based virtual screening for alpha4beta1 receptor. Initially, seventeen (17) structures were selected (based on the inhibitory activity values, IC50) and the structure with the best value was chosen as the pivot. The pharmacophoric pattern was determined from the online PharmaGist server and resulted in a model of score value equal to 97.940 with 15 pharmacophoric characteristics that were statistically evaluated via Pearson correlations, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). A refined model generated four pharmacophoric hypotheses totaling 1.478 structures set of Zinc_database. After, the pharmacokinetic, toxicological and biological activity predictions were realized comparing with pivot structure that resulted in five (ZINC72088291, ZINC68842860, ZINC14365931, ZINC09588345 and ZINC91247798) structures with optimal in silico predictions.

RESULTS: Leukemia (ICD-10; C91-C95) showed significantly higher SIRs (95% confidence interval (CI)) compared to the government employee group (1.86, 1.15-2.84) and the whole employee group (1.77, 1.10-2.70). CONCLUSION: Air transportation industry workers have an increased risk of leukemia compared to other occupational groups.","['Lee, Wanhyung', 'Kang, Mo-Yeol', 'Yoon, Jin-Ha']","['Lee W', 'Kang MY', 'Yoon JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1682-865X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4198-2955']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon 21565, Korea.', ""Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222, Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul 06591, Korea. snaptoon@naver.com."", 'The Institute for Occupational Health, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea. flyinyou@gmail.com.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea. flyinyou@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190814,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,PMC6727080,['NOTNLM'],"['*air transportation industry workers', '*leukemia', '*neoplasms']",2019/08/17 06:00,2020/01/08 06:00,['2019/08/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph16162906 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph16162906 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Aug 14;16(16). pii: ijerph16162906. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16162906.,20200107,,,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Aerospace Medicine', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential association of maternal coffee and tea consumption during pregnancy with childhood AML risk, pooling primary data from eight case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. METHODS: Information on coffee and/or tea consumption was available for 444 cases and 1255 age- and sex-matched controls, on coffee consumption for 318 cases and 971 controls and on tea consumption for 388 cases and 932 controls. Categories for cups of daily coffee/tea consumption were created in order to explore potential dose-response associations. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Associations were found neither in the analysis on coffee or tea nor in the analysis on coffee only consumption (any versus no). A positive association with increasing coffee intake was observed (>1 cup per day; OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92, increment of one cup per day; OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.39). No associations were observed with tea consumption. Interaction analyses showed non-significant associations between coffee/tea and smoking. Hyperdiploidy was inversely associated with tea consumption, with other cytogenetic markers having no association with coffee/tea. CONCLUSION: Given the widespread consumption of caffeinated beverages among pregnant women, our finding is of important public health relevance, suggesting adverse effects of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy in the offspring.","['Karalexi, Maria A', 'Dessypris, Nick', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Erdmann, Friederike', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Bonaventure, Audrey', 'Greenop, Kathryn R', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Petridou, Eleni Th']","['Karalexi MA', 'Dessypris N', 'Clavel J', 'Metayer C', 'Erdmann F', 'Orsi L', 'Kang AY', 'Schuz J', 'Bonaventure A', 'Greenop KR', 'Milne E', 'Petridou ET']",,"['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'INSERM U1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Paris-Descartes University, Villejuif, France; RNCE - National Registry of Childhood Cancers, Inserm, Villejuif and CHU de Nancy, Villejuif, France.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA 94704-1070, USA.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France; Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'INSERM U1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Paris-Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA 94704-1070, USA.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'INSERM U1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Paris-Descartes University, Villejuif, France; Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, PO Box 855, West Perth, WA 6872, Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, PO Box 855, West Perth, WA 6872, Australia.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

Because of its rarity and relatively high overall survival rate, prospective randomized trials to investigate alternative APL treatment schedules are challenging. Mathematical models may provide useful information in this regard. We collected clinical data from 38 patients treated for APL under the International Consortium on Acute Leukemia (ICAL) protocol and laboratory data during induction therapy. We propose a mathematical model that represents the dynamics of leukocytes in peripheral blood and the effect of ICAL treatment on the disease's dynamics. We observe that our cohort presents demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes similar to previous clinical trials on APL. Over a follow-up period of 41.8 months, the relapse-free survival and overall survival at two years are both found to be 78.7%. For two selected patients, the model produces a good fit to the clinical data. Information such as the response to treatment and risk of relapse can be derived from the model, and this may assist in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials.","['Yoshinari, Gerson Hiroshi Jr', 'Fassoni, Artur Cesar', 'Mello, Luis Fernando', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Yoshinari GH Jr', 'Fassoni AC', 'Mello LF', 'Rego EM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5837-5743', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1567-4086']","['Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Matematica e Computacao, Universidade Federal de Itajuba, Itajuba, MG, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Matematica e Computacao, Universidade Federal de Itajuba, Itajuba, MG, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo and Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, LIM31, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190815,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6695187,,,2019/08/16 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0221011 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-32982 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Aug 15;14(8):e0221011. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221011. eCollection 2019.,20200303,e0221011,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Survival Rate']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.7849280'],,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib, a first-in-class Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been approved for use in the treatment of CLL. This drug has shown beneficial effects including a higher overall response rate, sustained remissions, and a tolerable toxicity level. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the adverse drug events which were associated with the use of ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with CLL. METHODS: A careful search was carried out through the Cochrane Central, EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), and through www.ClinicalTrials.com. The following criteria for inclusion were considered: Both randomized trials and observational cohorts; Studies comparing the adverse drug events observed with the use of ibrutinib versus a control group for the treatment of CLL. The RevMan software (version 5.3) was used to carry out this analysis and the analyzed data were represented by risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total number of 2456 participants with CLL were included in this analysis. One thousand one hundred thirteen participants were treated with ibrutinib whereas the remaining 1343 participants were assigned to the control (non-ibrutinib) group. Results of this current analysis showed Ibrutinib not to be associated with significantly higher risk of anemia (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.67-1.21; P = .49), thrombocytopenia (RR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.32-1.14; P = .12), neutropenia (RR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25-1.00; P = .05), and febrile neutropenia (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.32-2.49; P = .83) in these patients with CLL. The risk for respiratory tract infection was also similarly manifested (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.78-1.30; P = .96). However, ibrutinib was associated with a high risk of abdominal manifestations in comparison to the control group (RR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.32-2.00; P = .00001). The risk for diarrhea was also significantly higher in the Ibrutinib group (RR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.44-3.17; P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS: During the treatment of CLL, ibrutinib was not associated with significantly higher risks of anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia compared to the control group. However, abdominal manifestations were significantly higher with ibrutinib. Advanced phase trials should further confirm this hypothesis.","['Zhou, Yanhua', 'Lu, Hongtao', 'Yang, Meifeng', 'Xu, Chenhong']","['Zhou Y', 'Lu H', 'Yang M', 'Xu C']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou First People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou."", ""Department of Cardiology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, The Second Clinical Medical College, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou First People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou."", ""Department of Cardiology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, The Second Clinical Medical College, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC6831170,,,2019/08/16 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016915 [doi]', '00005792-201908160-00094 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Aug;98(33):e16915. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016915.,20190903,e16915,,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Abdominal Pain/chemically induced', 'Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Constipation/chemically induced', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of high-proportion medium chain triglyceride (MCT) on body fat distribution and levels of leptin and adiponectin during chemotherapy of children with ALL.New-onset ALL children treated at the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center between March 2016 and March 2017 were enrolled. Children were divided into the MCT and control groups. For the MCT group, high-proportion MCT nutrition preparation was added to the diet, while no MCT was added for the control group. The MCT group was further divided into subgroups A and B based on the amount of supplement. Waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, bone marrow concentrations of leptin and adiponectin, and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio were measured before and on days 19 and 46 of chemotherapy. Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured on admission and discharge.Waist circumference in the control group increased by day 46 (P = .047), but did not change in the MCT group. The BMI of the children in the control group was higher than those in the MCT group on admission (P = .003), but not different at discharge. No significant differences in hip circumference, leptin levels, adiponectin levels, and body weight were observed between the 2 groups.This preliminary study suggests that short-term supplementation of high-proportion MCT nutrition preparation may help reduce the centripetal distribution of adipose induced by the application of glucocorticoids in children with ALL.

Emphasis was given to modifications capable of engaging in additional polar interactions with the c-Met active site. In addition, ortho-fluorinations of the terminal benzene ring were explored. Fifteen new molecules were synthesized and evaluated in a c-Met enzymatic binding assay. A wide range of substituents were tolerated in the quinoline 6-position, while the ortho-fluorinations performed were shown to give considerable reductions in the c-Met binding affinity. The antiproliferative effects of the compounds were evaluated in the NCI60 cancer cell line panel. Most notably, compounds 15b and 18b were able to inhibit cell proliferation more efficiently than cabozantinib in leukemia, CNS, and breast cancer cell lines. The in vitro data agreed well with the in silico docking results, where additional hydrogen bonding was identified in the enzymatic pocket for the para-amino substituted 15b and 18b.","['Lien, Vegard Torp', 'Pettersen, Solveig', 'Haugen, Mads Haugland', 'Olberg, Dag Erlend', 'Maelandsmo, Gunhild M', 'Klaveness, Jo']","['Lien VT', 'Pettersen S', 'Haugen MH', 'Olberg DE', 'Maelandsmo GM', 'Klaveness J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8830-9077'],"['Department of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, OUS Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, OUS Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Norwegian Medical Cyclotron Center, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, OUS Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT-Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190815,Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,,['NOTNLM'],"['NCI60', 'c-Met', 'cabozantinib', 'kinases', 'quinolones']",2019/08/16 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ardp.201900101 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2019 Sep;352(9):e1900101. doi: 10.1002/ardp.201900101.

Here, we determined the clinical outcome of pediatric patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) expressing the gammadelta TCR. Of 100 newly diagnosed T-ALL patients, 93 had gammadelta TCR analysis performed at diagnosis. Repertoire was evaluated by paired sequencing of the rearranged TCR. All patients received intensified chemotherapy and those with minimal residual disease (MRD) >/= 1% on day 42-46 became candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation. Of the 93 T-ALL patients, 12 (13%) had gammadelta T-ALL and 11 (12%) had early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL. Compared to the remaining 70 T-ALL patients, the gammadelta T-ALL patients were more likely to have MRD >/= 1% on day 15-19 (67% vs. 33%, P = 0.03) and day 42-49 (33% vs. 7%; P = 0.007) of remission induction. The 10-year overall survival for gammadelta T-ALL patients (66.7% +/- 22.2%) were lower than that of T-ALL patients (93.3% +/- 7.3%, P = 0.001). TCR analysis demonstrated a conserved clonotype. In conclusion, the data suggest that children with gammadelta T-ALL may have a poor response to remission induction, based on MRD levels and decreased survival than the other T-ALL patients, despite receiving risk-directed therapy.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Tomchuck, Suzanne L', 'Evans, Scarlett N', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Choi, John K', 'Thomas, Paul G', 'Dallas, Mari Hashitate']","['Pui CH', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Tomchuck SL', 'Evans SN', 'Inaba H', 'Jeha S', 'Raimondi SC', 'Choi JK', 'Thomas PG', 'Dallas MH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4068-3470'],"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI091938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA141762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190517,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6682360,['NOTNLM'],"['*HCT', '*TCR repertoire', '*pediatric T-ALL', '*risk stratification', '*gammadelta T cells', '*gammadelta T-ALL']",2019/08/16 06:00,2019/08/16 06:01,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2019.1599637 [doi]', '1599637 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2019 May 17;8(8):1599637. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2019.1599637. eCollection 2019.,,1599637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also utilized natural killers as another vehicle for CAR engineered cells and this strategy similarly and robustly eliminated CD4- expressing AML cells in vitro and had a potent in vivo anti-leukemic effect and was noted to have shorter in vivo persistence.

There are four isoforms of actinins in mammals (ACTN1-4). Recently, the relationship between actinins and cancer has been discovered in many types of malignancy, yet their prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. Methods: We collected data of 155 de novo AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database; 85 patients received chemotherapy only and 70 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We divided each treatment groups into sub-groups based on the median expression levels of ACTN1-4. Results: Survival analysis showed that in the chemotherapy-only group, high ACTN1 and ACTN3 expression were associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (p<0.01). Multivariate analysis suggested that high expression of ACTN1 and ACTN3 (p<0.05) were independent poor prognostic factors. In the allo-HSCT group, ACTN1-4 expression had no impact on survival. Conclusions: Our study suggested that high expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 adversely affected the survival of AML patients, but their harmful impact could be overcome by allo-HSCT.","['Yang, Xinrui', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Zhang, Jilei', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Zhang, Xinpei', 'Zhang, Gaoqi', 'Yang, Siyuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Hu, Kai', 'Wang, Jijun', 'Jing, Hongmei', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Fu, Lin']","['Yang X', 'Pang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Shi J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang G', 'Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Hu K', 'Wang J', 'Jing H', 'Ke X', 'Fu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI 48073, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190710,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,PMC6691690,['NOTNLM'],"['ACTN3', 'ACTN1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'prognosis']",2019/08/16 06:00,2019/08/16 06:01,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.31766 [doi]', 'jcav10p4286 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2019 Jul 10;10(18):4286-4292. doi: 10.7150/jca.31766. eCollection 2019.,,4286-4292,,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, PALB2 has been recognized as a cog in the cellular machinery for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). PALB2 also mediates S and G2 DNA damage checkpoints, and has an apparent function in protecting transcriptionally active genes from genotoxic stress. PALB2 also interacts with, is localized by, and functions downstream of BRCA1. Further, PALB2 interacts with other essential effectors of HR, including RAD51 and RAD51C, as well as BRCA2. Consistent with its function in HR and its interaction with key HR proteins, PALB2-deficient cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and DNA interstrand crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin. Mechanistically, PALB2 is required for HR by mediating the recruitment of BRCA2 and the RAD51 recombinase to sites of DNA damage. Similar to bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and RAD51C, bi-allelic mutations in PALB2 cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare childhood disorder which is associated with progressive bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies, and a predisposition to leukemia and solid tumors. Due to their close functional relationship, bi-allelic mutations of PALB2 and BRCA2 cause particularly severe forms of FA, called FANCN and FANCD1, both characterized by severe congenital abnormalities and very early onset of various cancers. This includes acute leukemias, Wilms tumor, medulloblastoma and neuroblastomas. Also, heterozygous germ-line mutations of PALB2, like mutations in several other essential HR genes listed above, yield an increased susceptibility to breast and pancreatic cancer.","['Hanenberg, Helmut', 'Andreassen, Paul R']","['Hanenberg H', 'Andreassen PR']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen Germany."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology & Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati OH, USA.""]",['eng'],['R01 HL085587/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,France,Atlas Genet Cytogenet Oncol Haematol,Atlas of genetics and cytogenetics in oncology and haematology,100956732,PMC6693662,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast Cancer Susceptibility', 'DNA Repair', 'Fanconi anemia', 'Homologous Recombination', 'Tumor Suppressor']",2018/04/01 00:00,2018/04/01 00:01,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4267/2042/69016 [doi]'],ppublish,Atlas Genet Cytogenet Oncol Haematol. 2018 Apr;22(12):484-490. doi: 10.4267/2042/69016.,,484-490,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS1029371'],,,,,

Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 (mut) ), present in 7-14% of AML patients, have been discovered recently, opening the door to targeted agents aiming to improve the outcomes in this setting. Several oral selective IDH1 (mut) inhibitors are under investigation, ivosidenib being the first approved for R/R AML. We performed a systematic review to analyze the clinical outcomes and safety reported with IDH1 (mut) inhibitors and other agents in adult patients with IDH1 (mut) R/R AML. Ivosidenib in monotherapy achieved complete remission (CR) of 24%, overall response of 42%, and median overall survival of 9 months in R/R AML, and promising outcomes were reported with IDH305 and FT-2102. IDH1 (mut) inhibitors were generally well tolerated, but some therapy-related toxicities should be monitored, including IDH-differentiation syndrome, prolongation of the QT interval, and leukocytosis, all manageable and reversible. Also, venetoclax, CB-839, PARP inhibitors, and IDH1 peptide vaccine are being studied in IDH1(mut) AML.

Moreover, NHL secondary to CML is common in T cell lymphoma, while NHL of B cell origin is rare. Since 1999, only 22 cases with B cell lymphoma have been reported, of which 4 cases have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The lesions of DLBCL were in lymph node, liver, jejunum, and soft palate. To our knowledge, it has no report for the primary gastric DLBCL (PG-DLBCL) occurring in CML. Here we reported a 63-year-old man of chronic phase (CP) CML associated with PG-DLBCL. The patient was diagnosed with CML nearly eight years ago and was treated with imatinib and nilotinib successively. However, gastroscopy found malignant lesions in the patient's stomach in March 2018, and the masses were diagnosed as PG-DLBCL. Subsequently, with the treatment of the RCOP + lenalidomide regimen chemotherapy for 3 cycles, the patient achieved nearly complete remission (CR).","['Cai, Zhimei', 'Liu, Shuo', 'Zi, Jie', 'Ma, Jinlong', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Cai Z', 'Liu S', 'Zi J', 'Ma J', 'Ge Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8028-1612'],"[""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Lianyungang 222002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190722,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6660623,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'simultaneous']",2019/08/16 06:00,2019/08/16 06:01,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S212838 [doi]', '212838 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jul 22;12:5917-5923. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S212838. eCollection 2019.,,5917-5923,,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors can inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL fusion protein to trigger the cells apoptosis, drug resistance or intolerance exists in part of CML patients. Arsenic sulfide in its raw form (r-As4S4) can be orally administrated and certain therapeutic effects have been found out in the treatment of hematologic malignancies through inducing cell apoptosis. Methods: In this work, a water-dissolvable arsenic sulfide nanoformualtion (ee-As4S4) composed of As4S4 particulates with 470 nm in diameter and encapsulated by a kind of hydrophilic polymer was fabricated and applied to the CML cell line K562, K562/AO2 and primary cells from the bone marrow of CML patients. Results: Results showed that instead of inhibiting the activity of BCR-ABL, ee-As4S4 induced direct degradation of BCR-ABL in K562 cells within 6 hr incubation, followed by the occurrence of erythroid differentiation in K562 after 72 hr incubation, evidenced by the significantly upregulated CD235a and benzidine staining, which was not detectable with r-As4S4. The ee-As4S4-induced erythroid differentiation was also observed in K562/AO2 cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells of CML patients. Mechanistic studies indicated that ee-As4S4 induced autophagy by downregulating the level of intracellular ROS and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha significantly, which led to the subsequent degradation of BCR-ABL. When the concentration was increased, ee-As4S4 induced much more significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than r-As4S4, and the cytotoxicity of the former was about 178 times of the latter. Conclusion: ee-As4S4 was capable of inducing significant erythroid differentiation of CML cells by inducing the direct degradation of BCR-ABL; the new effect could improve hematopoietic function of CML patients as well as inhibit the leukemic cell proliferation.","['Wang, Tao', 'Wen, Tao', 'Li, Hongmin', 'Han, Bing', 'Hao, Suisui', 'Wang, Chuan', 'Ma, Qiang', 'Meng, Jie', 'Liu, Jian', 'Xu, Haiyan']","['Wang T', 'Wen T', 'Li H', 'Han B', 'Hao S', 'Wang C', 'Ma Q', 'Meng J', 'Liu J', 'Xu H']",,"[""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190722,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC6661449,['NOTNLM'],"['As4S4', 'ROS', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'erythroid differentiation']",2019/08/16 06:00,2019/10/19 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S207298 [doi]', '207298 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2019 Jul 22;14:5581-5594. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S207298. eCollection 2019.,20191018,5581-5594,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfides)', '44SIJ800OX (arsenic trisulfide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', '*Drug Compounding', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) dominantly hydroxylates two highly conserved proline residues of HIF-1alpha to promote its degradation. This study was designed to construct an intrabody against PHD2 that can inhibit PHD2 activity and promote angiogenesis. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against PHD2, INP, was isolated by phage display technique and was modified with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sequence to obtain ER-retained intrabody against PHD2 (ER-INP). ER-INP was efficiently expressed and bound to PHD2 in cells, significantly increased the levels of HIF-1alpha, and decreased hydroxylated HIF-1alpha in human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) cells and mouse mononuclear macrophage leukaemia cell line (RAW264.7) cells. ER-INP has shown distinct angiogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo, as ER-INP expression significantly promoted the migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and enhanced angiogenesis of chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs). Furthermore, ER-INP promoted distinct expression and secretion of a range of angiogenic factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report an ER-INP intrabody enhancing angiogenesis by blocking PHD2 activity to increase HIF-1alpha abundance and activity. These results indicate that ER-INP may play a role in the clinical treatment of tissue injury and ischemic diseases in the future.","['Zhao, Liangzhong', 'Liu, Ziyu', 'Yang, Fang', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Xue, Ying', 'Miao, Haipeng', 'Liao, Xiangzhi', 'Huang, Hongli', 'Li, Guiying']","['Zhao L', 'Liu Z', 'Yang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Xue Y', 'Miao H', 'Liao X', 'Huang H', 'Li G']",,"['Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'Department of Immunoassay Technology, Jilin Medical University, Jilin, 132013, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, P.R.

Understanding the regulation of telomerase in hematopoietic cells is relevant to the pathogenesis of leukemia, in which telomerase is constitutively activated, as well as bone marrow failure syndromes that feature telomerase insufficiency. Past studies showing high levels of telomerase in human erythroblasts and a prevalence of anemia in disorders of telomerase insufficiency provide the rationale for investigating telomerase regulation in erythroid cells. Here it is shown for the first time that the telomerase RNA-binding protein dyskerin (encoded by DKC1) is dramatically upregulated as human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells commit to the erythroid lineage, driving an increase in telomerase activity in the presence of limiting amounts of TERT mRNA. It is also shown that upregulation of DKC1 was necessary for expansion of glycophorin A(+) erythroblasts and sufficient to extend telomeres in erythroleukemia cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays implicated GATA1-mediated transcriptional regulation of DKC1 in the modulation of telomerase in erythroid lineage cells. Together these results describe a novel mechanism of telomerase regulation in erythroid cells which contrasts with mechanisms centered on transcriptional regulation of TERT that are known to operate in other cell types. This is the first study to reveal a biological context in which telomerase is upregulated by DKC1 and to implicate GATA1 in telomerase regulation. The results from this study are relevant to hematopoietic disorders involving DKC1 mutations, GATA1 deregulation and/or telomerase insufficiency.","['Richards, Laura A', 'Kumari, Ashu', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Thoms, Julie Ai', 'von Jonquieres, Georg', 'Napier, Christine E', 'Ali, Zara', ""O'Brien, Rosemary"", 'Marks-Bluth, Jonathon', 'Maritz, Michelle F', 'Pickett, Hilda A', 'Morris, Jonathan', 'Pimanda, John E', 'MacKenzie, Karen L']","['Richards LA', 'Kumari A', 'Knezevic K', 'Thoms JA', 'von Jonquieres G', 'Napier CE', 'Ali Z', ""O'Brien R"", 'Marks-Bluth J', 'Maritz MF', 'Pickett HA', 'Morris J', 'Pimanda JE', 'MacKenzie KL']",,"[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick."", 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney.', 'School of Medical Sciences, UNSW, Sydney.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick."", ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick."", 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick."", ""Telomere Length Regulation Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead."", 'The University of Sydney School of Medicine, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, St Leonards.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney.', 'School of Medical Sciences, UNSW, Sydney.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick kmackenzie@cmri.org.au."", ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW, Sydney."", 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190814,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7271591,,,2019/08/16 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.215699 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.215699 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jun;105(6):1517-1526. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.215699.

In the cohort of patients receiving grafts from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor, patients given PBSC with ATG (n=1,021) and those given BM without ATG (n=1,633) presented comparable severe GvHD-free relapse-free survival (GRSF)(hazard ratio [HR]=0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8-1.1, P=0.5) and overall survival (HR=1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2, P=0.8). They had however, a lower incidence of chronic GvHD (cGvHD) (HR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.9, P=0.01). In the cohort of patients receiving grafts from HLA-matched unrelated donor , patients given PBSC with ATG (n=2,318) had better severe GvHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) than those given BM without ATG (n=303) (HR=0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-0.9, P=0.001).

We evaluated the function of Meningioma 1 (MN1), a co-factor of HOXA9 and MEIS1, in human and murine MLL-rearranged leukemia by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of MN1. MN1 was required for in vivo leukemogenicity of MLL positive murine and human leukemia cells. Loss of MN1 inhibited cell cycle and proliferation, promoted apoptosis and induced differentiation of MLL-rearranged cells. Expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing from previously reported data sets demonstrated that MN1 primarily maintains active transcription of HOXA9 and HOXA10, which are critical downstream genes of MLL, and their target genes like BCL2, MCL1 and Survivin. Treatment of MLL-rearranged primary leukemia cells with anti-MN1 siRNA significantly reduced their clonogenic potential in contrast to normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting a therapeutic window for MN1 targeting. In summary, our findings demonstrate that MN1 plays an essential role in MLL fusion leukemias and serve as a therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia.","['Sharma, Amit', 'Jyotsana, Nidhi', 'Gabdoulline, Razif', 'Heckl, Dirk', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Slany, Robert K', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Sharma A', 'Jyotsana N', 'Gabdoulline R', 'Heckl D', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Slany RK', 'Ganser A', 'Heuser M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany heuser.michael@mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190814,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7193500,,,2019/08/16 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.211201 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.211201 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1294-1305. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.211201.

OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginase in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy in children and adolescents was conducted to compare it with native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase. PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Scopus, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) and EMBASE databases were selected. The following outcomes were analyzed: complete remission of the disease, event-free survival, overall survival, anti-asparaginase antibody level, hypersensitivity reactions, asparaginase and asparagine serum levels, number of postdiagnosis events, and overall mortality. Five randomized controlled trials were included. Analysis of the quality of evidence and risk of bias was performed using the Cochrane recommendation tool and the GRADE system. RESULTS: The assessment results suggest that the level of certainty on the technology addressed is relatively weak from a methodological point of view. Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because of the limited number and power of studies and important flaws in their design or conduct in classifying PEG-asparaginase as a superior drug or not, in the pharmacotherapy of ALL in children and adolescents. PEG-asparaginase can be used as a substitute for native E. coli L-asparaginase, demonstrating similar efficacy and safety. CONCLUSION: The study may help decision-makers in the public health system to offer a more in-depth judgment on the therapeutic alternatives used to treat this neoplasm in children and adolescents.","['Medawar, Camile Valle', 'Mosegui, Gabriela Bittencourt Gonzalez', 'Vianna, Cid Manso de Mello', 'Costa, Talita Martins Alves da']","['Medawar CV', 'Mosegui GBG', 'Vianna CMM', 'Costa TMAD']",,"['Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

But such deep responses are also associated with severe immuno-depletion, leading to infections and the development of secondary cancers. METHODS: We assessed, blood MRD and normal immune cell levels at the end of treatment, in 162 first-line FCR patients, and analysed survival and adverse event. RESULTS: Multivariate Landmark analysis 3 months after FCR completion identified unmutated IGHV status (HR, 2.03, p = 0.043), the level of MRD reached (intermediate versus low, HR, 2.43, p = 0.002; high versus low, HR, 4.56, p = 0.002) and CD4 > 200/mm(3) (HR, 3.30, p < 0.001) as factors independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS); neither CD8 nor NK counts were associated with PFS. The CD4 count was associated with PFS irrespective of IGHV mutational status, but only in patients with detectable MRD (HR, 3.51, p = 0.0004, whereas it had no prognostic impact in MRD < 10(- 4) patients: p = 0.6998). We next used a competitive risk model to investigate whether immune cell subsets could be associated with the risk of infection and found no association between CD4, CD8 and NK cells and infection. CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation/maintenance trials based on detectable MRD after FCR should investigate CD4 T-cell numbers both as a selection and a response criterion, and consolidation treatments should target B-cell/T-cell interactions.","['Gauthier, Martin', 'Durrieu, Francoise', 'Martin, Elodie', 'Peres, Michael', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Filleron, Thomas', 'Oberic, Lucie', 'Bijou, Fontanet', 'Quillet Mary, Anne', 'Ysebaert, Loic']","['Gauthier M', 'Durrieu F', 'Martin E', 'Peres M', 'Vergez F', 'Filleron T', 'Oberic L', 'Bijou F', 'Quillet Mary A', 'Ysebaert L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4102-7261'],"['Department of Haematology, Toulouse-Oncopole University Cancer Institute (IUCT-O), 1 Avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Biology Haematology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Institut Claudius Regaud, IU, CT-O, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Biology Haematology, Toulouse-Oncopole University Cancer Institute (IUCT-O), Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Biology Haematology, Toulouse-Oncopole University Cancer Institute (IUCT-O), Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Institut Claudius Regaud, IU, CT-O, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Toulouse-Oncopole University Cancer Institute (IUCT-O), 1 Avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Medical Haematology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm UMR1037, Cancer Research Centre of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Toulouse-Oncopole University Cancer Institute (IUCT-O), 1 Avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse, France. ysebaert.loic@iuct-oncopole.fr.', 'Inserm UMR1037, Cancer Research Centre of Toulouse, Toulouse, France. ysebaert.loic@iuct-oncopole.fr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190814,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6694602,['NOTNLM'],"['CD4 T-cells', 'Chemo-immunotherapy', 'Chronic lymphocytic Leukaemia', 'Immunosuppression', 'Minimal residual disease']",2019/08/16 06:00,2020/01/09 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5971-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5971-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Aug 14;19(1):809. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5971-z.,20200108,809,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This review provides a comprehensive and critical overview of select available AML animal models. These include the non-mammalian Zebrafish and Drosophila models as well as the mammalian rodent systems, comprising rats and mice. The suitability of each animal model, its contribution to the advancement of knowledge in AML pathophysiology and treatment, as well as its advantages and limitations are discussed.

Motor, cognitive, and social difficulties related to cancer therapies heavily impact the development of children with cancer. This study focused on two main aims: To assess the developmental pathways of preschool children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia one year post-treatment and to compare these abilities both with those of a control group of healthy peers and with Italian norms. Forty-four children and their families, recruited through the Hematology-Oncologic Clinic of the Department of Child and Woman Health (University of Padua), agreed to participate in this study. The children's mean age was 4.52 years (SD = 0.94, range = 2.5-6 years), equally distributed by gender, all diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Matched healthy peers were recruited through pediatricians' ambulatories. Each family was interviewed adopting the Vineland adaptive behavior scales. Paired sample Wilcoxon tests revealed that children were reported to have significantly more developmental difficulties than their healthy peers. When compared with Italian norms, they scored particularly low in verbal competence, social, and coping skills. No significant association was found between treatment variables and developmental abilities. These findings suggest that the creation of specialized interventions, both for parents and children, may fill the possible delays in children's development probably due to stress, lack of adequate stimulation, or difficult adaptation.","['Tremolada, Marta', 'Taverna, Livia', 'Bonichini, Sabrina', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Biffi, Alessandra']","['Tremolada M', 'Taverna L', 'Bonichini S', 'Pillon M', 'Biffi A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0392-4332'],"['Department of Development and Social Psychology, University of Padua, 35131 Padova, Italy. marta.tremolada@unipd.it.', ""Department of Women and Child's Health, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Center, University of Padua, 35127 Padova, Italy. marta.tremolada@unipd.it."", 'Faculty of Education, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, 39042 Brixen-Bressanone, Italy.', 'Department of Development and Social Psychology, University of Padua, 35131 Padova, Italy.', ""Department of Women and Child's Health, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Center, University of Padua, 35127 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women and Child's Health, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Center, University of Padua, 35127 Padova, Italy.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190813,Switzerland,Children (Basel),"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",101648936,PMC6721313,['NOTNLM'],"['adaptive behavior', 'developmental skills', 'healthy peers', 'leukemia', 'preschool']",2019/08/16 06:00,2019/08/16 06:01,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:01 [medline]']","['children6080092 [pii]', '10.3390/children6080092 [doi]']",epublish,Children (Basel). 2019 Aug 13;6(8). pii: children6080092. doi: 10.3390/children6080092.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we explore the stable production of HCVpp aiming to reduce the variability associated with transient productions. The performance of stably produced HCVpp was assessed by evaluating the influence of Human Serum and the impact of CD81 cellular expression on the infectivity of HCVpp. After evaluating the performance of stably produced HCVpp we studied the effect of co-expressing p7NS2 openreading frame (ORF) on HCVpp infectivity. Our data clearly shows an enhanced infectivity of HCVppp7NS2. Even though the exact mechanism was not completely elucidated, the enhanced infectivity of HCVppp7NS2 is neither a result of an increase production of virus particles nor a result from increased envelope density. The inhibitory effect of p7 inhibitory molecules such as rimantadine suggests a direct contribution of p7 ion channel for the enhanced infectivity of HCVppp7NS2 which is coherent with a pH-dependent cell entry mechanism. In conclusion, we report the establishment of a stable production system of HCVpp with enhanced infectivity through the overexpression of p7NS2 ORF contributing to improve HCV entry assessment assays widely used in antiviral drug discovery and vaccine development.","['Soares, Hugo R', 'Ferreira-Fernandes, Marina', 'Almeida, Ana I', 'Marchel, Mateusz', 'Alves, Paula M', 'Coroadinha, Ana S']","['Soares HR', 'Ferreira-Fernandes M', 'Almeida AI', 'Marchel M', 'Alves PM', 'Coroadinha AS']",,"['iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2780-901 Oeiras, Portugal; Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2780-901 Oeiras, Portugal; Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2780-901 Oeiras, Portugal; Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal; Centro de Quimica Estrutural, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida Rovisco Pais, 1049-001 Lisboa, Portugal.', 'iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2780-901 Oeiras, Portugal; Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2780-901 Oeiras, Portugal; Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.

METHODS: By using data from the Blood or Marrow Transplant Survivor Study, the authors examined late mortality in 447 patients with CML who underwent BMT between 1974 and 2010, conditional on surviving >/=2 years post-BMT. For vital status information, the medical records, the National Death Index, and the Accurint database were used. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using general population age-specific, sex-specific, and calendar-specific mortality rates. Kaplan-Meier techniques and Cox regression were used for all-cause mortality analyses. Cumulative incidence and proportional subdistribution hazards models for competing risks were used for cause-specific mortality analyses. RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival rate was 65.7% and 73% for those who underwent transplant with and without pre-BMT exposure to TKI therapy, respectively. Patients who underwent transplant with and without pre-BMT TKI experienced SMRs of 6.4 and 6.4, respectively (P = .8); and the SMRs were 11.6 and 8.1, respectively, for those with high-risk disease (P = .2). Independent predictors of non-CML-related mortality included chronic graft-versus-host disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8-4.4) and busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; reference, total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide conditioning). The 20-year cumulative incidence of CML-related and non-CML-related mortality was 6% and 36%, respectively, for the entire cohort. Both CML-related mortality (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.1-12.6) and non-CML-related mortality (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.6-3.1) were comparable for those with and without pre-BMT TKI therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The similar late mortality experienced by patients with CML who undergo transplantation with or without pre-BMT TKIs suggests that allogeneic BMT can be considered in the context of TKI intolerance or nonadherence.

However, the structures of natural products are diverse and difficult to elucidate. Cordyceps militaris is a parasitic fungus which usually grows on host insects. The metabolites of C. militaris have been reported to act as chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we aimed for the structural elucidation of specialized metabolites derived from C. militaris, and the metabolic impact in leukemia cells. METHODS: We describe a liquid chromatography data-dependent mass spectrometric platform combining tandem mass analysis and molecular networking. Leukemia cells treated with C. militaris extract and control groups were visualized in terms of their metabolic profiles using Global Natural Product Social (GNPS) molecular networking. By this method, we were able to elucidate the structures of metabolites from medicinal fungus extracts and cancer cells and then to recognize their changes in a semi-quantitative manner. RESULTS: Using C. militaris and leukemia cells as examples, we found that approximately 100 new ion species were present in the treated leukemia cells, suggesting a highly altered metabolic profile. Specifically, based on the tandem mass spectral similarity, we proposed that cordycepin, a key fungus-derived therapeutic agent known for its antitumor activity, was transformed into its methylthio form in leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: The platform described provides an ability to investigate complex molecular interactions of natural products in mammalian cells. By incorporating tandem mass spectrometry and molecular networking, we were able to reveal the chemical modification of crude bioactive compounds, for example potential bioactive compounds which might be modified from cordycepin. We envision that such a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow, combined with other metabolomics platforms, would enable much wider applicability to cell biology and be of great potential to pharmacological study as well as drug discovery.","['Gao, Yi-Ling', 'Wang, Ying-Jing', 'Chung, Hsin-Hsiang', 'Chen, Ko-Chien', 'Shen, Tang-Long', 'Hsu, Cheng-Chih']","['Gao YL', 'Wang YJ', 'Chung HH', 'Chen KC', 'Shen TL', 'Hsu CC']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4644-1891', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6476-3814', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2892-5326']","['Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology and Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology and Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology and Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['NTU-ERP-106R880211/Center for Emerging Materials and Advanced Devices, National', 'Taiwan University', '107-2321-B-002-045 (TLS lab)/Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of ROC', '106-3114-B-002-005/Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of ROC', '108-2636-M-002-008- (CCH lab)/Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of ROC', '107-2321-B-001-038-/Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of ROC', '106-2113-M-002-013-MY2/Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of ROC']",['Journal Article'],20191106,England,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,8802365,,,,2019/08/15 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rcm.8549 [doi]'],ppublish,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2020 Apr;34 Suppl 1:e8549. doi: 10.1002/rcm.8549.

Early (<6 months) relapse is associated with dismal outcome, while the majority of relapses occur early after transplantation. A more precise indication which patients could benefit from reinduction therapy is warranted. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 83 patients with postallogeneic HSCT relapse. Patients were divided based on intention to treat (curative vs supportive care). RESULTS: Of the 50 patients treated with curative intent, 44% reached complete remission (CR) upon reinduction chemotherapy, and of these patients, 50% survived. Two survivors reached CR after immunotherapy (donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), without reinduction chemotherapy). Sixty-nine percent of the survivors had received high-intensity cytarabine treatment, followed by immunologic consolidation. Relapse <3 months after transplantation was predictive for adverse survival (P = .004), but relapse <6 months was not. In fact, >50% of the survivors had a relapse <6 months. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the dismal prognosis of postallogeneic HSCT relapse. Importantly, our data demonstrate that patients fit enough to receive high-dose chemotherapy, even when relapse occurred <6 months, had the best chance to obtain durable remissions, in particular when immunologic consolidation was performed after reaching CR.","['de Jong, Greta', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Biemond, Bart J', 'Zeerleder, Sacha S', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Visser, Otto', 'Nur, Erfan', 'Meijer, Ellen', 'Hazenberg, Mette D']","['de Jong G', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Biemond BJ', 'Zeerleder SS', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Visser O', 'Nur E', 'Meijer E', 'Hazenberg MD']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8566-5014'],"['Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunopathology, Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology Center, Isala Klinieken Zwolle, Zwolle, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['91715362/ZonMw', '1438F/Landsteiner Foundation for Blood Transfusion Research', '2014-6557/KWF Kankerbestrijding']",['Journal Article'],20190814,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,PMC6851577,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'graft-versus-leukemia', 'outcome']",2019/08/15 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13315 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Nov;103(5):491-499. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13315.

Such types of receptors are highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, which could be used in its treatment. CD33 shows high variability in its expression levels with still unknown reasons. Here, we investigated the CD33 expression of monocytes in human blood samples processed at different temperatures and in dependence on their phagocytic activity against opsonized Escherichia coli. The samples were stained by fluorescently labelled anti-human CD14 to specify the monocyte population, anti-human CD33 antibodies to evaluate CD33 expression and analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In blood samples kept at 37 degrees C or first pre-chilled at 0 degrees C with subsequent warming up to 37 degrees C, the percentage of CD33-positive monocytes as well as their relative fluorescence intensity was up-regulated compared to samples kept constantly at 0 degrees C. After exposure to E. coli the CD33 relative fluorescence intensity of the monocytes activated at 37 degrees C was 3 to 4 times higher than that of those cells kept inactive at 0 degrees C. Microscopic analysis showed internalisation of CD33 due to its enhanced expression on the surface followed by engulfment of E. coli.","['Suwannasom, Nittiya', 'Smuda, Kathrin', 'Kloypan, Chiraphat', 'Kaewprayoon, Waraporn', 'Baisaeng, Nuttakorn', 'Boonla, Chanchai', 'Georgieva, Radostina', 'Baumler, Hans']","['Suwannasom N', 'Smuda K', 'Kloypan C', 'Kaewprayoon W', 'Baisaeng N', 'Boonla C', 'Georgieva R', 'Baumler H']",,"['Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190814,Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,,,,2019/08/15 06:00,2019/12/20 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4149/gpb_2019021 [doi]'],ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2019 Sep;38(5):369-378. doi: 10.4149/gpb_2019021.

It is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a known carcinogen to humans (group 1) and associated with the development of leukemia. In general, the population is exposed to this substance by inhaling contaminated air, which varies according to the location and intensity of its potential sources. The petrochemical industry is one of the most important sources of this compound. The municipality of Duque de Caxias, specifically the Campos Eliseos district, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, houses the Industrial Complex of Campos Eliseos (PICE), a grouping of over 25 industries, which includes the second largest oil refinery in Brazil. Environmental contamination from the PICE has been recognized, but there is a lack of studies concerning its impact on the health of the surrounding population. S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) concentrations ranging from 0.80 to 8.01mug.g-1 creatinine were observed in the local population, apparently related to hematological changes also observed in exposed population. The quantifiable presence of urinary S-PMA from the benzene metabolism is associated with the fact that 60% of the participants present specific hematological changes, which may be due to the environmental benzene exposure. The allele and genotype frequencies of the CYP2E1 and NQO1 enzymes observed in the study population were similar to those reported in other studies. The presence of the variant allele in the NQO1 genotype may be a risk factor for the observed hematological changes.","['Silva, Cristiane Barata', 'Mota, Caroline de Lima', 'Almeida, Yasmin Rocha', 'Emidio, Vanessa', 'Fonseca, Antonio Sergio A', 'Mitri, Simone', 'Moreira, Josino Costa']","['Silva CB', 'Mota CL', 'Almeida YR', 'Emidio V', 'Fonseca ASA', 'Mitri S', 'Moreira JC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2940-2121', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2021-6525', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6645-6110', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6165-9816', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3527-156X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2400-333X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7457-2920']","['Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190812,Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,,,2019/08/15 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2019000905011 [pii]', '10.1590/0102-311X00198618 [doi]']",epublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2019 Aug 12;35(7):e00198618. doi: 10.1590/0102-311X00198618.,20200529,e00198618,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '4775-80-8 (S-phenyl-N-acetylcysteine)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/urine', '*Benzene/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/urine', 'Brazil', 'Causality', 'Chemical Industry', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/analysis/genetics', '*Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Health Surveys/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Male', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/analysis/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the effect of MTGase on the physicochemical properties and immunoreactivity of tofu relative to conventional coagulants [brine and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL)]. Structural changes of the MTGase cross-linked soymilk protein were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The IgE-binding capacity of MTGase cross-linked proteins was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The physicochemical properties, quality characteristics, and surface microstructures of five different types of tofu were determined by the Kjeldahl nitrogen method, texture analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The digestibility of tofu was evaluated in vitro by simulated gastrointestinal (GIS) digestion. A cell sensitization experiment was performed in vitro to evaluate the capability of tofu digestion products to induce the release of bioactive mediators from human basophil leukemia (KU812) cells. Results indicated that MTGase significantly changed the advanced structure of the soymilk protein. Compared with tofu without MTGase, the composite coagulant tofu containing MTGase exhibited better quality. MTGase improved the water-holding capacity (WHC) of the internal mesh structure and increased the yield of tofu. The digestion products of the composite coagulant tofu, especially the GDL plus MTGase tofu, induced KU812 cells to release fewer bioactive mediators compared with those of MTGase-free tofu. MTGase can not only improve the quality of conventional coagulant tofu but also reduce the potential allergenicity of tofu to a certain extent.","['Zhu, Jierui', 'Deng, Han', 'Yang, Anshu', 'Wu, Zhihua', 'Li, Xin', 'Tong, Ping', 'Chen, Hongbing']","['Zhu J', 'Deng H', 'Yang A', 'Wu Z', 'Li X', 'Tong P', 'Chen H']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5756-2755', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5988-3643', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0298-6411', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4900-7556']","['State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn and Sino-German Joint Research Institute, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn and Sino-German Joint Research Institute, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn and Sino-German Joint Research Institute, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn and Sino-German Joint Research Institute, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China. yanganshu@ncu.edu.cn chenhongbing@ncu.edu.cn and Sino-German Joint Research Institute, Nanchang University, Nanjing Dong Lu 235, Nanchang 330047, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190814,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,,,,2019/08/15 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9fo01118h [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2019 Sep 1;10(9):5485-5497. doi: 10.1039/c9fo01118h.
