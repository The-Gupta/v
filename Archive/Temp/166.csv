Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells were subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated in SCID mice, then removed 31 days after the inoculation. The cells were embedded in a small volume (18 nL) of a collagen-gel matrix on a pyramid-shaped silicon microstructure for further cultivation. The respiration activity of the cells on the chip was measured by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The proliferation behavior was continuously monitored for 6 days. It seemed that the proliferation rate of the cells removed from the mice was lower than that cultured in a flask and conformed to that in mice. The effects of cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16) on the HL-60 cultured in vivo were in good agreement with those obtained by a conventional colorimetric assay. Our results suggest that the SECM-based assay is appropriate for biopsy specimens in a relatively short-time evaluation.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Torisawa, Yu-suke', 'Shiku, Hitoshi', 'Kasai, Shigenobu', 'Nishizawa, Matsuhiko', 'Matsue, Tomokazu']","['Torisawa YS', 'Shiku H', 'Kasai S', 'Nishizawa M', 'Matsue T']","['Department of Biomolecular Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Z4152N8IUI (Silicon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Collagen', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Electrochemistry/*instrumentation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Microcomputers', 'Microscopy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', '*Silicon']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/03/18 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11693 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Mar 20;109(2):302-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 5 years, the overall transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 34%, and patient survival was 50%. In Cox multivariate analysis, 32 potential risk factors were analyzed. Monoclonal antibody OKT-3 during conditioning was correlated with grade II to IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and TRM. HLA-DP mismatch was associated with poor TRM and poor survival. Cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients with a seronegative donor had a decreased leukemia-free survival. Five-year TRM was 14% with no risk factor, 38% with 1 risk factor, and 87% with 2 risk factors.

The structure-activity relationship established from the results indicated that the prenyl group has an important role in the cytotoxic effects. However, imperatorin showed the highest sensitivity to HL-60 cells and the least cytotoxicity to normal PBMCs. Osthol and imperatorin both caused apoptotic bodies, DNA fragmentation, and enhanced PARP degradation in HL-60 cells by biochemical analysis.

Expression analysis of 18 AML bone marrow specimens showed that recurrent AML is commonly associated with the mRNA expression changes in a set of 58 genes. Increased cellular proliferation was indicated by the overexpression of the transferrin receptor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and G1 cyclins. An immunohistochemical study for Ki-67-positive blasts in 18 paired bone marrow biopsy samples confirmed a highly significant (P<0.0001) increase in the proliferation fraction at relapse. In addition, we found enhanced activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade as mRNAs of MKP-1, c-jun, c-fos, and egr-1 were significantly increased at relapse. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses for biphosphorylated ERK1/2 protein provide additional evidence for enhanced activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.

A system was established that permits inducible overexpression in homogeneous cell populations that simultaneously synthesize interfering short hairpin RNAs. We present evidence that the functional interplay of TOGp and MCAK proteins is manifested as three distinct phenotypes during the cell cycle. The first involves a role for TOGp in protecting spindle MTs from MCAK activity at the centrosome, which appears essential to prevent the formation of disorganized multipolar spindles. The second phenotype involves TOGp-dependent counteraction of excessive MCAK activity during mitosis, which recapitulates the previously established plus-end specific counteractive activities in vitro. The third involves an unexpected destabilization of the interphase MTs by overexpressed TOGp, a phenotype that requires endogenous MCAK.

We conclude that inhibition of survivin expression is an attractive therapeutic strategy in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and that combining survivin ASO with rituximab may enhance the efficacy of this approach.",,"['Ansell, S M', 'Arendt, B K', 'Grote, D M', 'Jelinek, D F', 'Novak, A J', 'Wellik, L E', 'Remstein, E D', 'Bennett, C F', 'Fielding, A']","['Ansell SM', 'Arendt BK', 'Grote DM', 'Jelinek DF', 'Novak AJ', 'Wellik LE', 'Remstein ED', 'Bennett CF', 'Fielding A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. ansell.stephen@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403281 [doi]', '2403281 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Mar;18(3):616-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403281.,,,"['CA92104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the FANCA gene are the most prevalent, accounting for two-thirds of FA cases. Affected individuals have greatly increased risks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This raises the question as to whether inherited or acquired mutations in FA genes might be involved in the development of sporadic AML. Quantitative fluorescent PCR was used to screen archival DNA from sporadic AML cases for FANCA deletions, which account for 40% of FANCA mutations in FA homozygotes. Four heterozygous deletions were found in 101 samples screened, which is 35-fold higher than the expected population frequency for germline FANCA deletions (P<0.0001). Sequencing FANCA in the AML samples with FANCA deletions did not detect mutations in the second allele and there was no evidence of epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation. However, real-time quantitative PCR analysis in these samples showed reduced expression of FANCA compared to nondeleted AML samples and to controls. These findings suggest that gene deletions and reduced expression of FANCA may be involved in the promotion of genetic instability in a subset of cases of sporadic AML.",,"['Tischkowitz, M D', 'Morgan, N V', 'Grimwade, D', 'Eddy, C', 'Ball, S', 'Vorechovsky, I', 'Langabeer, S', 'Stoger, R', 'Hodgson, S V', 'Mathew, C G']","['Tischkowitz MD', 'Morgan NV', 'Grimwade D', 'Eddy C', 'Ball S', 'Vorechovsky I', 'Langabeer S', 'Stoger R', 'Hodgson SV', 'Mathew CG']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Division of Genetics and Development Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, London, UK. mtischkowitz@doctors.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Methylation', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exons', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403280 [doi]', '2403280 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Mar;18(3):420-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403280.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined these parameters in different mouse strains. Total cellularity in BALB/c mice was 530+/-20 million cells; stable from 8 weeks to 1 year of age. C57BL/6J mice had 466+/-48 million marrow cells. Using these data, theoretical models of infused marrow (40 million cells) replacing or adding to host marrow give chimerism values of 7.5 and 7.0%, respectively; the observed 8-week engraftment of 40 million male BALB/c marrow cells into female hosts (72 mice) gave a value of 6.91+/-0.4%. This indicates that syngeneic engraftment is determined by stem cell competition. Our studies demonstrate that most marrow cells, progenitors and engraftable stem cells are in the spine.

TEL-Syk fusion transformed interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 to growth factor independence. Here, we investigate the intracellular signal transduction of the stable transfectants. TEL-Syk fusion protein was associated with the p85 subunit of phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3-K) followed by the activation of Akt in the absence of IL-3. Vav, phospholipase C-gamma2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also constitutively activated. TEL-Syk also activated the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in the absence of Janus kinase 2 activation. None of these kinases were phosphorylated in the BaF3 cells transfected with TELDeltaPNT-Syk in which the oligomerization domain of TEL was deleted. Inhibitor analysis showed that the MAPK pathway was important in TEL-Syk-mediated cell proliferation. The immunofluorescence technique revealed that the TEL-Syk fusion protein was located in the cytoplasm.

Recently we have isolated resveratrol and its dimers and trimers from peony (Paeonia lactiflora) seeds, and reported their strong antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. In the present study, we have evaluated cellular effects of resveratrol derivatives; viniferin, gnetin H, and suffruticosol B on the proliferation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells in vitro. All resveratrol and its derivatives reduced viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner with their IC(50) values of 20-90 microM. Ascending orders of IC(50) values were suffruticosol B, gnetin H, viniferin and resveratrol respectively. HL-60 cells treated with the four stilbenes exhibited the distinct morphological changes characteristics of cell apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, apoptotic bodies, and DNA fragmentations. A time-dependent histogram of the cellular DNA analyzed by flow cytometry revealed a rapid increase in subdiploid cells and a concomitant decrease in diploid cells exposed to 100 microM resveratrol for 0-24 h. Cells treated with 25 microM of resveratrol, viniferin, gnetin H, and suffruticosol B for 24 h resulted in increment of sub-G1 population by 51, 5, 11 and 59%, respectively. Treatment of cells with 0-20 microM resveratrol for 5 h produced a concentration-dependent decrease in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 mRNA levels. Suffruticosol B also suppressed CYP1B1 gene expression. These results demonstrated that resveratrol oligomers also strongly suppressed HL-60 cell proliferation, and induced DNA damage.

The precise mechanisms responsible for the effects of CDDO, however, remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of CDDO and its C-28 imidazolide ester (CDDO-Im) on apoptosis of multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The results show that both CDDO and CDDO-Im are potent inducers of MM cell apoptosis and that CDDO-Im is more active than CDDO. CDDO-Im treatment was associated with (a) depletion of glutathione, (b) increases in reactive oxygen species, (c) a reduction of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein, (d) activation of caspase-8, and (e) a decrease of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The reducing agents, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, DTT, and catalase inhibited each of these CDDO-Im-induced proapoptotic signals. Inhibition of caspase-8 with z-IETD-fmk also abrogated CDDO-Im-induced decreases of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and inhibited apoptosis.

Telomeres are specialized DNA-protein structures that protect chromosome ends from being recognized and processed as DNA strand breaks. In mammals, telomere protection depends on the T(2)AG(3) repeat binding protein TRF2, which has been shown to remodel telomeres into large duplex loops (t-loops). In this work we show that PARP-2 physically binds to TRF2 with high affinity. The association of both proteins requires the N-terminal domain of PARP-2 and the myb domain of TRF2. Both partners colocalize at promyelocytic leukemia bodies in immortalized telomerase-negative cells. In addition, our data show that PARP activity regulates the DNA binding activity of TRF2 via both a covalent heteromodification of the dimerization domain of TRF2 and a noncovalent binding of poly(ADP-ribose) to the myb domain of TRF2. PARP-2(-/-) primary cells show normal telomere length as well as normal telomerase activity compared to wild-type cells but display a spontaneously increased frequency of chromosome and chromatid breaks and of ends lacking detectable T(2)AG(3) repeats.

Here we identify the erythroid cell-specific glycophorin A gene (GPA) as a target of SCL in primary hematopoietic cells and show that SCL occupies the GPA locus in vivo. GPA promoter activation is dependent on the assembly of a multifactorial complex containing SCL as well as ubiquitous (E47, Sp1, and Ldb1) and tissue-specific (LMO2 and GATA-1) transcription factors. In addition, our observations suggest functional specialization within this complex, as SCL provides its HLH protein interaction motif, GATA-1 exerts a DNA-tethering function through its binding to a critical GATA element in the GPA promoter, and E47 requires its N-terminal moiety (most likely entailing a transactivation function). Finally, endogenous GPA expression is disrupted in hematopoietic cells through the dominant-inhibitory effect of a truncated form of E47 (E47-bHLH) on E-protein activity or of FOG (Friend of GATA) on GATA activity or when LMO2 or Ldb-1 protein levels are decreased.

For this reason, and also in light of the high mortality rate associated with these infections, chemoprophylaxis has been advocated by several authors. The available evidence suggests that both fluconazole and itraconazole are able to decrease candida colonisation and infection, when compared with placebo or with nonabsorbable antifungals. Data seem also to suggest that a decrease in fungus-related mortality can be achieved with prophylaxis, although with little effect on overall mortality, probably because of the importance of severe underlying diseases. Itraconazole proved to be effective in the prevention of fungal infections, including invasive aspergillosis, although with increased incidence of side-effects, often leading to treatment discontinuation. The other side of the coin is that antifungal prophylaxis might have untoward effects, such as the selection of triazole-resistant Candida strains or the induction of resistance. In addition, some authors have suggested that the use of triazoles might modulate the pattern of infecting organisms in cancer patients, increasing the risk of both aspergillosis and bacteremia. In conclusion, antifungal prophylaxis with triazole antifungals should be used with caution, only in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections. These include allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients (especially those with mismatched or unrelated donors), acute myeloid leukaemia patients treated with high-dose cytarabine (C-ara), very-low-birth-weight infants, patients with chronic granulomatous disease, and high-risk surgical and intensive-care unit patients.",,"['Castagnola, E', 'Machetti, M', 'Bucci, B', 'Viscoli, C']","['Castagnola E', 'Machetti M', 'Bucci B', 'Viscoli C']","[""Infectious Diseases Unit and Department of Haematology and Oncology, G.Gaslini Children's Hospital, Genoa, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Azoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azoles/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/etiology', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['847 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1470-9465.2004.00847.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2004 Mar;10 Suppl 1:86-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1470-9465.2004.00847.x.,,,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,

Among immunocompetent patients, tissue breakdown (as caused by trauma, severe burns or foreign body) is the risk factor for fusariosis. Infections include keratitis, onychomycosis and occasionally peritonitis and cellulitis. Treatment is usually successful and requires removal of the foreign body as well as antifungal therapy. Among immunocompromised patients, mainly patients with haematological malignancies, Fusarium spp. are the second most common pathogenic mould. Risk factors for disseminated fusariosis include severe immunosuppression (neutropenia, lymphopenia, graft-versus-host disease, corticosteroids), colonisation, tissue damage, and receipt of a graft from an HLA-mismatched or unrelated donor. Clinical presentation includes refractory fever (> 90%), skin lesions and sino-pulmonary infections ( approximately 75%). Type of skin lesions includes ecthyma-like, target, and multiple subcutaneous nodules. Skin lesions lead to diagnosis in > 50% of patients and precede fungemia by approximately 5 days. In contrast to disseminated aspergillosis, disseminated fusariosis can be diagnosed by blood cultures in 40% of patients. Histopathology reveals hyaline acute-branching septate hyphae similar to those found in aspergillosis. Mortality from fusarial infections in immunocompromised patients ranges from 50% to 80%. Host immune status is the single most important factor predicting outcome. Persistent neutropenia and corticosteroid therapy significantly affect survival. Optimal treatment has not been established. Anecdotal successes have been reported with various agents (high-dose amphotericin B, lipid-based amphotericin B formulations, itraconazole, voriconazole) and with cytokine-stimulated granulocyte transfusions.

Parental viral genomes initially become juxtaposed to ND10, and then viral replication compartments develop from the ND10-associated genomes. Viral immediate-early (IE) regulatory protein ICP0 colocalizes with ND10 and then induces the degradation of critical ND10 component protein PML and therefore the release and dispersal of other ND10 proteins. The IE transcriptional regulatory protein ICP4 also forms foci at early times of infection, many of which are juxtaposed to ND10 and later develop into replication compartments, indicating that at least some of the initial ICP4 foci contain parental viral genomes. Here we report that the ICP4 foci also contain ICP27 and that their formation occurs extremely rapidly at locations just inside the nuclear envelope. By examining developing plaques or thinly seeded cells infected at high multiplicity, we found evidence to suggest that at least some of the ND10-viral nucleoprotein complex association could be attributed to de novo formation of ND10-like structures in response to incoming viral genomes. The ICP4 complexes associated efficiently with ND10 in cells infected with an ICP0-null mutant virus at high but not at low multiplicity, and the degree of association was reduced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Therefore, the interaction between viral nucleoprotein complexes and ND10 is in part due to a dynamic response by the cell. This response is modulated by functional ICP0, and cells that are productively or nonproductively infected in the absence of functional ICP0 can be distinguished by the relative locations of ICP4 foci and ND10 proteins.",,"['Everett, Roger D', 'Sourvinos, George', 'Leiper, Claire', 'Clements, J Barklie', 'Orr, Anne']","['Everett RD', 'Sourvinos G', 'Leiper C', 'Clements JB', 'Orr A']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, United Kingdom. r.everett@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (ICP27 protein, human herpesvirus 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (herpes simplex virus, type 1 protein ICP4)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/virology', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.4.1903-1917.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Feb;78(4):1903-17. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.4.1903-1917.2004.,,PMC369473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During multistep transformation, Ab-MLV-infected pre-B cells undergo p53-dependent apoptosis during the crisis phase of transformation. Even once cells are fully transformed, an active v-Abl protein tyrosine kinase is required to suppress apoptosis because cells transformed by temperature-sensitive (ts) kinase mutants undergo rapid apoptosis after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature. However, inactivation of the v-Abl protein by a temperature shift interrupts signals transmitted via multiple pathways, making it difficult to identify those that are critically important for the suppression of apoptosis. To begin to dissect these pathways, we tested the ability of an SH2 domain Ab-MLV mutant, P120/R273K, to rescue aspects of the ts phenotype of pre-B cells transformed by the conditional kinase domain mutant. The P120/R273K mutant suppressed apoptosis at the nonpermissive temperature, a phenotype correlated with its ability to activate Akt. Apoptosis also was suppressed at the nonpermissive temperature by constitutively active Akt and in p53-null pre-B cells transformed with the ts kinase domain mutant.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate physicians' explanation and parental understanding of randomization in childhood leukemia RCTs. DESIGN AND SETTING: A multisite study of the informed consent communication process for RCTs of childhood leukemia. Consecutive cases were recruited from pediatric oncology inpatient wards at 6 US children's hospitals associated with major academic medical centers from July 1, 1999, until December 31, 2001. The informed consent conferences were observed and audiotaped, and the information obtained was coded and analyzed. Parents were interviewed shortly after the conference to ascertain their understanding. PARTICIPANTS: Parents and members of the health care team who participated in 137 informed consent conferences for children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed explanations of randomization and parental understanding of randomization after the consent conference. RESULTS: Randomization was explained by physicians in 83% of cases and a consent document was presented during the conference in 95% of cases. Interviews after the conference demonstrated that 68 (50%) of 137 parents did not understand randomization. Parents of racial minority and lower socioeconomic status were less likely to understand randomization (P<.001 for each). Discussion of specific clinical trial details and the presence of a nurse during the conference were associated with understanding. Eighty-four percent of children were enrolled in a leukemia trial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite oral and written explanation, half of the parents in this study did not understand randomization for childhood leukemia trials.

Remission was induced in three of the five patients with acute leukaemia. One patient, who presented at birth, remains well five years after diagnosis. All four patients with TMD survive. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital leukaemia is very rare but is not inevitably fatal. Finding trisomy 21 in spontaneously dividing blood or bone marrow cells of an infant with putative acute leukaemia, particularly within 3 months of birth, should encourage a cautious clinical approach and suggests that the diagnosis might be TMD.",,"['Bajwa, R P S', 'Skinner, R', 'Windebank, K P', 'Reid, M M']","['Bajwa RP', 'Skinner R', 'Windebank KP', 'Reid MM']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*congenital/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/03/03 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.2003.12039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2004 Feb;57(2):186-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2003.12039.,,PMC1770212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the regulation of the CRAC channel by intracellular or extracellular messengers as well as its molecular identity is largely unknown. Specifically, in the absence of extracellular divalent cations it becomes permeable to monovalent cations with a larger conductance, however this monovalent cation current inactivates rapidly by an unknown mechanism. Here we found that Ca(2+) dissociation from a site on the extracellular side of the CRAC channel is responsible for the inactivation of its Na(+) current, and Ca(2+) occupancy of this site otherwise potentiates its Ca(2+) as well as Na(+) currents.

Patients with a > or =10-year life expectancy will be randomized to either radical prostatectomy (RP) alone versus estramustine and docetaxel before RP. Participants will be excluded if they have received prior therapy for prostate cancer (except transurethral resection of the prostate) or are judged not to be appropriate candidates for RP. Eligible patients will be stratified according to their predicted probability of remaining free from disease recurrence at 5 years after surgery (0% to 20%, 21% to 40%, and 41% to 60%) and randomized. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be 6 cycles (1 cycle = 21 days) of estramustine (280 mg tid, days 1 to 5) and docetaxel (70 mg/m2 on day 2). Warfarin (2 mg/day orally) will be given for prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. Bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and RP will be performed within 60 days of registration/randomization for men randomized to the surgery-alone arm. For men randomized to receive preoperative chemotherapy, the surgical procedure will be performed within 60 days of completion of chemotherapy. Patients will be monitored with history review, physical examination, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels every 3 months for the first 3 years after surgery, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and annually thereafter. Biochemical disease recurrence will be defined as a serum PSA level >0.4 ng/mL on 2 consecutive occasions > or =3 months apart after RP. The time of biochemical failure is measured from the date of randomization to the time of the first PSA level <0.4 ng/mL that is confirmed on the second serial PSA. The primary study end point is to determine if early systemic treatment with neoadjuvant estramustine and docetaxel before RP in patients with high-risk prostate cancer will decrease 5-year recurrence rates when compared with RP alone. Secondary outcomes will include (1) the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant estramustine and docetaxel before RP; (2) the impact of this neoadjuvant strategy on pathologic tumor stage, including lymph node and surgical margin status; (3) time to clinically apparent disease recurrence; and (4) overall survival. The impact of RP with and without neoadjuvant estramustine and docetaxel on the patient's quality of life from pretreatment through year 3 will be assessed. Frozen prostate tissue will be obtained from men undergoing prostatectomy who are enrolled in either the treatment or control arms of the trial. These samples will be analyzed for their RNA expression patterns in order to build outcome prediction models. Furthermore, using array-based methods of expression analysis, the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and response to chemotherapy may likewise be predicted. The trial will enroll approximately 700 men during a 48-month period. Patients will be observed for 84 months after study closure. The power to detect a 36% decrease in 5-year recurrence rates is 90%.",,"['Eastham, James A', 'Kelly, William K', 'Grossfeld, Gary D', 'Small, Eric J']","['Eastham JA', 'Kelly WK', 'Grossfeld GD', 'Small EJ']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 94115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '35LT29625A (Estramustine)', '5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Docetaxel', 'Estramustine/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/*methods', '*Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', '*Prostatectomy/methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Risk', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Thromboembolism/prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Warfarin/therapeutic use']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/04/17 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0090429503009038 [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2003.09.052 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2003 Dec 29;62 Suppl 1:55-62. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2003.09.052.,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, antineoplastic therapy additionally increases the risk of secondary cancers. In this study, we analysed whether treatment with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA) during the course of CLL had an impact on the subsequent occurrence of either secondary solid tumours or Richter's syndrome. There were 1487 eligible patients, 251 treated with 2-CdA alone, 913 treated with alkylating agents (AA)-based regimens alone and 323 treated with both 2-CdA and AA. Median time from the start of CLL treatment to the diagnosis of secondary malignancy was 1.9 years (0.5-5.1 years) for the 2-CdA group, 1.8 years (0.3-7.9 years) for the AA group and 3.9 years (0.3-8.4 years) for the 2-CdA+AA group. A total of 68 malignancies were reported in 65 patients. Ten events were non-melanotic skin cancers and were excluded from the analysis, leaving 58 events in 58 patients. In the group of patients treated with 2-CdA alone, there were 15 (6.0%) cases, in the group of patients treated with AA alone there were 26 (2.8%) cases, and in the group treated with 2-CdA+AA there were 17 (5.3%) cases of secondary malignancies. The differences between the frequency of secondary malignancies in the 2-CdA and 2-CdA+AA versus AA alone groups were not significant (P=0.05 and P=0.06, respectively). Only lung cancers occurred significantly more frequently in the 2-CdA (2.8%) and 2-CdA+AA (2.2%) treated groups compared with the AA patients (0.3%) (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively). In conclusion, 2-CdA in CLL patients does not seem to increase the risk of secondary malignancies except for lung cancers.

Increasing use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens (RICR) and subsequent application of DLI forced the hemapheresis centers to collect donor lymphocytes in certain quantity and quality. The place of growth factors especially granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, filgrastim) in allogeneic hemapoietic stem cell (HSC) collection is established, but there is no consensus about the role of rhG-CSF. We aimed to clarify the dose effect of rhG-CSF on lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3+, CD3+4+, CD3+8+, CD19+, CD3-16+56+) cells and CD34+ HSC. DONORS AND METHODS: Major indications for DLI (mean volume: 180+/-52 ml) were for relapse or transplants using RICR mainly in patients with acute leukemia (n=20) or chronic myeloid leukemia (n=15). In four years we performed 40 lymphocyte apheresis (LA) on 30 healthy (med. age 28, M/F 21/9) donors using continuous flow cell separators by processing 2-2.5 times of their total blood volume (TBV). The apheresis data is divided into three groups according to rhG-CSF dose used for priming. Donors in Group I (n=18), Group II (n=9) and Group III (n=13) received no rhG-CSF (steady state), rhG-CSF 5 microg/kg/dsc x 5 days and rhG-CSF 10 microg/kg/dsc x 5 days, respectively. There was no difference within groups concerning TBV processed and recipient body weight. RESULTS: A total of 11,565 ml (+/-3700) of blood was processed in 216 min (+/-36.5) at an inlet of 56.8 ml/min (+/-10.6) using 999 ml (+/-307) ACD. The CD34+ HSC increased with increasing rhG-CSF dose as expected. Median CD3+ lymphocyte yield per recipient body weight in Group I, II and III were 0.9 x 10e8/kg (range: 0.1-2.1), 2.9 x 10e8/kg (range: 1.6-4.3) and 2.1 x 10e8/kg (range: 0.6-6.9), respectively. The primed donors T lymphocyte yield was 2-3-fold more in comparison to Group I. This gain was most significant between Group I and III in terms of mean CD3+ (1.09 x 10e8/kg vs 2.41 x 10e8/kg, p=0.02), CD3+4+ (0.64 x 10e8/kg vs 1.44 x 10e8/kg, p=0.02) and CD3+8+ (0.42 x 10e8/kg vs 0.89 x 10e8/kg, p=0.03) cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: Though the yield of lymphocyte subsets in G-CSF primed donors exceeds the non-primed donors, the target range of 1 x 10e7-1 x 10e8/kg CD3+ lymphocytes could be achieved in the majority of the apheresis procedures without rhG-CSF priming. The yield of T and B lymphocyte subsets are increased by G-CSF stimulation but not on a logarithmic scale, which did not correlate into a clinical relevance.",,"['Arat, Mutlu', 'Arslan, Onder', 'Gurman, Gunhan', 'Dalva, Klara', 'Ozcan, Muhit', 'Ugur, Aynur', 'Ilhan, Osman']","['Arat M', 'Arslan O', 'Gurman G', 'Dalva K', 'Ozcan M', 'Ugur A', 'Ilhan O']","['Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ibni Sina Hospital, Department of Hematology, Sihhiye, 06100 Ankara, Turkey. arat@medicine.ankara.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Transfusion', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD56 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Separation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukapheresis', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/01/30 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1473-0502(03)00199-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.transci.2003.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2004 Feb;30(1):9-15. doi: 10.1016/j.transci.2003.05.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 29 cases with early infectious complications following HSCT was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of early infectious complications following HSCT in 31 children (including 22 cord blood transplantation and 9 peripheral blood stem cells transplantation) was 94% (29/31). The first occurrence of the early infectious complications was at a median of 6 (0 - 22) days, the peak time of incidence was at a median of 4 - 7 days post transplantation. The duration of the first early infectious complications was at a median of 9 (3 - 20) days. The occurrence of the second early infectious complications was at a median of 19 (13 - 27) days. For all of the 29 children, when they developed early infectious complications their absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were all > 0.5 x 10(9)/L. The most common infectious sites were the digestive tract (oral and gastro-intestinal mucositis) and then the respiratory tract. Gram negative blood infections were quite frequent and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was common in the oral-pharynx discharge cultures. Two children had Mycoplasma pneumonia infections and there were 4 incidences with fever but no definite infectious foci. The incidence and duration of early infectious complications following hematopoietic stem cells transplantation were associated with the duration of neutropenia. The source and the MNCs dose of the graft, the difference of conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis method did not have a significant impact on the incidence and duration of early infectious complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis (including Tienam) could delay the occurrence of the early infections significantly. CONCLUSION: The incidence and duration of early infectious complications following hematopoietic stem cells transplantation were directly associated with the duration of neutropenia.

A prospective historical control study evaluated the efficacy and safety of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) in this patient population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with AML or high-risk MDS who were undergoing induction chemotherapy received prophylactic ABLC 2.5 mg/kg intravenously 3 times weekly. This treatment group was compared with a historical control group that had similar baseline characteristics and received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) 3 mg/kg 3 times weekly. The primary endpoint was the incidence of documented or suspected fungal infections during and up to 4 weeks after cessation of prophylaxis. Reported adverse events were used to assess tolerability. RESULTS: The overall efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis was similar in patients who received ABLC and patients who received L-AmB (P=0.95). Among 131 ABLC-treated patients and 70 L-AmB-treated patients who were assessed for efficacy and safety, 49% of patients in each group completed therapy without developing a documented or suspected fungal infection. Documented fungal infections occurred in 5% of ABLC-treated patients and in 4% of L-AmB-treated patients. Alternative antifungal strategies were required because of persistent fever or pneumonia of unknown pathogen in 28% and 32% of ABLC-treated and L-AmB-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, therapy discontinuations due to adverse events, and survival rates also were similar between treatment groups.

The aim of the current study was to assess the toxicity, safety, and efficacy of IFN-alpha combined with isotretinoin in patients with advanced, refractory lymphoid malignancies. METHODS: Adults with biopsy-proven advanced lymphoid malignancy were treated. Patients with compromised bone marrow function (platelet counts as low as 30 x 10(9)/L) were eligible. Treatment was comprised of IFN-alpha at a starting daily dose of 3 mega units subcutaneously and isotretinoin orally starting at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily in 2 divided doses. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were evaluable. Their median age was 57 years (range, 18-82 years). Eighteen patients had advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 6 patients had peripheral T-cell lymphoma, 14 patients had Hodgkin disease, and 6 patients had a variety of other lymphoid malignancies. Patients with Hodgkin disease had received a median of 6 previous therapies (range, 3-12 therapies) and patients with other lymphoid malignancies had received a median of 4 previous therapies (range, 1-9 therapies).

The objective of the current study was to determine whether intravenous itraconazole (i.v. ITRA) reduced the incidence of probable/proven fungal infections in this group of patients, and compare the results with those of a historic control group treated with fluconazole plus itraconazole capsules (F+I). METHODS: Patients with AML and high-risk MDS who underwent induction chemotherapy received 200 mg of i.v. itraconazole over 60 minutes every 12 hours during the first 2 days followed by 200 mg given i.v. once daily. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled, 96 of whom were evaluable. Approximately 48% of the patients in the group of patients treated with i.v. ITRA as well as in the F+I group completed prophylaxis. Nine patients (9%) in the study group developed either proven/probable fungal infections (Candida glabrata in 5 patients, C. tropicalis in 1 patient, C krusei in 1 patient, and Fusarium in 2 patients) compared with 3 patients (4%) with proven fungal infection in the historic control group (C. tropicalis in 1 patient and Aspergillus in 2 patients). There were no significant differences noted between the two groups with regard to the percentage of patients who developed proven/probable or possible fungal infection as well as with regard to survival. These results also were obtained after adjusting for relevant prognostic factors (creatinine and bilirubin). The most common toxicity encountered with the use of i.v. ITRA was NCI Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its theoretic advantages, the authors found no evidence that i.v.

All three regions contain a large number of single-base polymorphisms. mtDNA was isolated according to standard laboratory procedures and amplified by PCR. Subsequently products were sequenced and evaluated with a semiautomated DNA sequencer system. So far, 21 human leukemia-lymphoma (LL) cell lines and nine other human cell lines were screened for contamination by other cell lines applying this method. We conclude that analysis of mtDNA polymorphisms is a quick, reliable and inexpensive method to detect intra - and interspecies cross-contamination and for the authentication of human LL cell lines. In comparison to other methods (cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunophenotyping), this technique is less laborious and time consuming.",,"['Hutter, Grit', 'Nickenig, Christina', 'Garritsen, Henk', 'Hellenkamp, Frank', 'Hoerning, Andre', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Dreyling, Martin']","['Hutter G', 'Nickenig C', 'Garritsen H', 'Hellenkamp F', 'Hoerning A', 'Hiddemann W', 'Dreyling M']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern/LMU, GSF-Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, Germany. hutter@gsf.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Untranslated Regions)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Untranslated Regions']",2004/01/28 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/01/28 05:00'],"['2004/01/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200317 [doi]', '6200317 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(1):61-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200317.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While responses in chronic phase are usually durable, resistance frequently develops in patients with advanced disease after an initial response. Several mechanisms of resistance have been demonstrated in vivo, including mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain and amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. We analyzed cytogenetics and screened for mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain as well as the activation loops of KIT and PDGFRA and B in 49 patients with CML or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with resistance to imatinib. Mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL were detected in 51.6% of patients with secondary resistance but not in patients with primary resistance. Three of these mutations have not been described before (T315D, F359D and D276G). By contrast, KIT and PDGFRA and B were consistently wildtype. Clonal evolution prior to imatinib was present in 68.8% of patients with primary resistance and in 45.5% with secondary resistance. Additional cytogenetic aberrations developed in 18.2% of patients at the time of relapse.

They belong to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources.",,"['Glonek, G F V', 'Solomon, P J']","['Glonek GF', 'Solomon PJ']","['School of Applied Mathematics, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biostatistics,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",100897327,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/standards', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Research Design/standards']",2004/01/28 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/01/28 05:00'],"['2004/01/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.89 [doi]', '5/1/89 [pii]']",ppublish,Biostatistics. 2004 Jan;5(1):89-111. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/5.1.89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated that transcripts for cytidine deaminase (CDA) were 2.7-fold lower in DS than for non-DS myeloblasts. In contrast, transcripts of cystathionine-beta-synthase and deoxycytidine kinase were a median 12.5- and 2.6-fold higher in DS compared with non-DS myeloblasts. The ratio of deoxycytidine kinase/CDA transcripts significantly correlated with ara-C sensitivities and ara-CTP generation. In clinically relevant AML cell line models, high cystathionine-beta-synthase transcripts in DS CMK cells were accompanied by 10-fold greater ara-C sensitivity and 2.4-fold higher levels of ara-CTP compared with non-DS CMS cells. Overexpression of CDA in non-DS THP-1 cells was associated with a 100-fold decreased ara-C sensitivity and 40-fold decreased ara-CTP generation. THP-1 cells secreted CDA into the incubation media and converted extracellular ara-C completely to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil within 30 min. Rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends (5'-RACE) and reverse transcription-PCR assays identified short- (sf) and long-form (lf) CDA transcripts in THP-1 cells with different 5' untranslated regions and translational start sites; however, only the latter resulted in the active CDA. Although 5' flanking sequences for both CDA transcripts exhibited promoter activity in reporter gene assays, activity for the CDAlf was low. The presence of several GATA1 binding sites in the CDAsf promoter and the uniform detection of GATA1 mutations in DS megakaryocytic leukemia suggested the potential role of GATA1 in regulating CDA transcription and the CDAsf promoter acting as an enhancer. Transfection of GATA1 into Drosophila Mel-2 cells stimulated the CDAlf promoter in a dose-dependent fashion.

Understanding the reasons behind these trends will require detailed surveillance and epidemiological study of NHL subtypes in large populations, using cancer registry or other multicenter data. However, little is known regarding the reliability of NHL diagnosis and subtype classification in such data, despite implications for the accuracy of incidence statistics and studies. Expert pathological re-review was completed for 1526 NHL patients who were reported to the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry and who participated in a large population-based case-control study. Agreement of registry diagnosis with expert diagnosis and with International Classification of Diseases for Oncology-2 (Working Formulation) subtype classifications was measured with positive predictive values and kappa statistics. Agreement of registry and expert diagnoses was high (98%). Thirty patients were found on review not to have NHL; most of these had leukemia. For subtypes, agreement of registry and expert classification was more moderate (59%). Agreement varied substantially by subtype from 5% to 100% and was 77% for the most common subtype, diffuse large cell lymphoma. Seventy-seven percent of 128 registry-unclassified lymphomas were assigned a subtype on re-review. Our analyses suggest excellent diagnostic reliability but poorer subtype reliability of NHL in cancer registry data information that is critical to the interpretation of lymphoma time trends. Thus, overall NHL incidence and survival statistics from the early 1990s are probably accurate, but subtype-specific statistics could be substantially biased, especially because of high (15-20%) proportions of unclassified lymphomas.",,"['Clarke, Christina A', 'Glaser, Sally L', 'Dorfman, Ronald F', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'Eberle, Erin', 'Holly, Elizabeth A']","['Clarke CA', 'Glaser SL', 'Dorfman RF', 'Bracci PM', 'Eberle E', 'Holly EA']","['Northern California Cancer Center, Union City, California, USA. tina@nccc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'International Classification of Diseases', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'SEER Program', 'San Francisco/epidemiology']",2004/01/28 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2004/01/28 05:00'],"['2004/01/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/1055-9965.epi-03-0250 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 Jan;13(1):138-43. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.epi-03-0250.,,,"['CA45614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CN-65107/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,28,,,,,,,,,,,

Azithromycin increased dose-dependently the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in adriamycin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/ADR) with no effect on the expression of P-glycoprotein in the cells. However, the inhibitory effect was much weaker than that of cyclosporin A and was comparable to that of erythromycin. When Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, which have drug transporting P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in the bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, received an infusion of doxorubicin, the steady-state biliary clearance of doxorubicin was significantly decreased for 40 min after a single intravenous injection of azithromycin.

METHODS: Six patients were diagnosed as AFFS based on history, nose, especially eye symptoms with or without fever, sinus CT and MRI, endoscopic and cytological findings in the nasal cavity. Surgical debridement was performed on 5 of 6 biopsy proven AFFS patients, one of them being amputated of the orbital content. With the original disease controlled simultaneously, 4 of 5 patients were prescribed with systemic amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B (1 case) and one with Itraconazole orally. One patient had not been involved with any of the anti-fungi measures. RESULT: Mucor (Zygomycetes) was identified on culture in 1 patient, Rhizopus species in 2, Aspergillus in 1, Alternaria in 1 and mixed Mucor and Rhizopus in 1. All patients were proved of tissue invasion histopathologically through biopsy. One patient died without any anti-fungi therapy on the 7th admission day, 3 patients survived for 88 days, 32 and 6 months respectively and died of original diseases (diabetes 1, leukaemia 2). One patient survived 9 months and lost for follow-up, 1 patient survived 11 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion and early endoscopic investigation through nasal cavity with fungal investigation should highly be strengthened for recognition of this disease. MRI findings should be considered as, or even more, important as that of CT scan on the early diagnoses. Extensive and aggressive surgical debridement, prompt and enough dosage of antifungal therapy intravenously, together with serious controlling of the underlying disease, all take important roles in the complete control of the disease.",,"['Liu, Ming', 'Zhou, Bing', 'Liu, Hua-chao', 'Zhang, Sheng-zhong', 'Wang, Yu-xin', 'Huang, Qian']","['Liu M', 'Zhou B', 'Liu HC', 'Zhang SZ', 'Wang YX', 'Huang Q']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China. mink@eastnet.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er bi yan hou ke za zhi,16210350R,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Debridement', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mycoses/diagnosis/microbiology/therapy', '*Sinusitis/diagnosis/microbiology/therapy']",2004/01/28 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/01/28 05:00'],"['2004/01/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/28 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Ke Za Zhi. 2003 Aug;38(4):251-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their effects on liquid tumours have not been fully established. By taking advantage of murine Friend Disease we have shown a strong antileukemic effect of celecoxib by determining novel in vitro targets. Western blot analyses revealed the expression of COX-2 in a panel of Friend Virus-transformed, splenic-derived primary erythroleukemic blasts and established cell lines generated in our laboratory. We have shown that celecoxib at concentrations as low as 20 microM significantly suppresses proliferation of the selected murine erythroleukemia cell line HB60-5. The greatest proliferative inhibition was seen at 40 microM of celecoxib, resulting in apoptosis. Our results also demonstrate that treatment of the established murine erythroleukemia cell line HB60-5 with celecoxib results in suppression of c-Kit and erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R) phosphorylation resulting in apoptosis, likely through decreased levels of survival factors. However, upon overexpression of c-Kit alone in these cells a significant increase in survival and twofold increase in proliferation in the presence of celecoxib were observed (P < 0.05). Finally, since responsiveness of our murine erythroleukemia cell lines to celecoxib is above the reported physiologically achievable levels in vivo, we have provided in vitro evidence to suggest that reduced sensitivity of erythroleukemic cells to lower doses of celecoxib may be a consequence of the loss of wild-type p53.

The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of cyclosporine A and prednisone. The recipient's origin of blasts could be demonstrated in two cases. All patients achieved complete remission after standard treatment. Nonetheless, disease relapsed in two patients at 2 and 6 months, whereas the patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia remains disease-free 4 years after diagnosis. As compared with the general population, the observed incidence of AML in the authors' series of LT results in a significantly higher SIR of 11.41 (P=0.0023). CONCLUSIONS: The higher SIR found in the authors' series suggests an increased risk of AML in patients undergoing LT.",,"['Camos, Mireia', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Rimola, Antoni', 'Grande, Luis', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Camos M', 'Esteve J', 'Rimola A', 'Grande L', 'Rozman M', 'Colomer D', 'Villamor N', 'Costa D', 'Montserrat E']","['Department of Hematology, Hemopathology Unit, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Liver Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2004/01/27 05:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2004/01/27 05:00'],"['2004/01/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.TP.0000102549.40531.13 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2004 Jan 27;77(2):311-3. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000102549.40531.13.,,,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 12 consecutive stereotactic biopsies and literature analysis were performed to analyze clinical, radiographic and histopathologic data. RESULTS: Stereotactic biopsy of lesions in the brainstem was in 96% diagnostic. There was one mortality (3% of cases) and 4% morbidity associated with the procedure. Pathology showed that half of the adult brainstem intrinsic lesions were gliomas, 10% were metastases, and the remainder were hematomas, vascular malformations, lymphomas, demyelination, cysts, radiation necrosis, abscesses, vasculitis, infarcts, leukemia, cryptococcus, or granulomas. CONCLUSIONS: Empiric treatment of adult brainstem lesions is not prudent because there is a wide spectrum of diverse pathology in this location. Stereotactic biopsy is a safe and effective method for determining histopathology.","['Copyright 2003 S.

This finding provided evidence of an active role of CD34(+) HCs during inflammation and immunological events. To investigate mechanisms by which CD34(+) HCs become activated and exert their immune-modulatory function, we used the human CD34(+) acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1a and CD34(+) bone marrow cells (BMCs). We showed that culture supernatants of LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells (SUP(LPS)) as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TauNF-alpha), but not LPS alone, can activate nuclear factor-kappaB in KG-1a cells. By cDNA subtraction and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, we revealed differential expression of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB)/IkappaBalpha (MAD-3), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in SUP(LPS)-stimulated KG-1a cells and up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-inducible T cell-chemoattractant, interleukin (IL)-8, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, RANTES, CD70, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and IL-1beta in stimulated KG-1a cells and CD34(+) BMCs. Although monokine induced by IFN-gamma, IFN-inducible protein 10, and IFN-gamma were exclusively up-regulated in KG-1a cells, differential expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage-derived chemokine, myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-2, and IL-18 receptor was only detectable in CD34(+) BMCs. More importantly, CD34(+) BMCs stimulated by TNF-alpha also showed enhanced secretion of MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and IL-8, and increased ICAM-1 protein expression could be detected in stimulated KG-1a cells and CD34(+) BMCs. Furthermore, we revealed that T cell proliferation can be induced by TNF-alpha-stimulated KG-1a cells, which is preventable by blocking anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies.

PBX1 protein is expressed throughout murine embryonic development, and its deletion in mice disrupts chondrogenesis. PBX protein levels are also increased in mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. To elucidate the role of PBX proteins in this process, we stably overexpressed PBX1b antisense mRNA in P19 cells (PBX1b-AS cells). PBX1b-AS cells did not differentiate to neuronal or endodermal cells following treatment with RA suggesting PBX proteins are required for both processes. Furthermore we demonstrated that PBX proteins regulate the RA-dependent induction in the mRNA levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and Decorin (DCN) in P19 cells using both PBX1b-AS cells and PBX1 small interfering RNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that PBX proteins directly bind to the promoter of Bmp4 and Dcn in vivo in a RA-dependent fashion. In addition, type I and type II BMP receptor mRNA levels were also increased in P19 cells following RA treatment; however, this was PBX-independent.

To directly compare the effect of different cis-regulatory sequences on recombination, we adapted our SV40 based model system to the analysis of correspondingly selected bcrs from the TAL1, LMO2, retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and MLL genes. We show that a 399 bp fragment from the MLL bcr is sufficient to cause a 3-4-fold stimulation of spontaneously occurring DNA exchange and to respond to etoposide by up to 10-fold further elevated frequencies, i.e. to mimic the fragility of the 8.3 kb bcr during chemotherapy. To analyse the regulatory role of p53 in recombination involving leukaemia-related sequences, we stably expressed wtp53 and a transactivation negative mutant. Consistent with the proposed role of p53 as a suppressor of error-prone recombination, both p53 proteins down-regulated recombination with most of the sequences tested, even with the MLL bcr after etoposide treatment. Surprisingly, however, p53 stimulated recombination, in constructs carrying the RARalpha bcr fragment. This is the first study, which provides evidence for a stimulatory role of p53 in homologous recombination. Our data further indicate that inhibition of topoisomerase I can mimic the effects of p53 on stimulating recombination on the RARalpha bcr.

To target colorectal tumors we fused a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope. A proline-rich hinge and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage site linked the two proteins. Following attachment to CEA, MMP cleavage of the envelope at the cell surface removed the scFv and proline-rich hinge, allowing transduction. This allowed selective targeting of CEA-positive cells in vivo after injection of producer cells at the site of the tumor, with up to 10% of cells within a CEA-positive tumor xenograft becoming transduced. Intraperitoneal injection of amphotropic producer cells resulted in transduction of cells in spleen, liver, and kidney, which was not detected when CEA-targeted producer cells were used.

The subjects included 79 ALL survivors who were at least 1 year post-treatment for ALL and 83 age-matched controls. Testing was carried out using various static balance tests designed to challenge central nervous system maintenance of balance and postural control. Patients were different from controls, across all age groups, in the more difficult task in which they were required to balance over a narrow base of support. However this did not reach statistical significance. When they were asked to perform this task with their eyes closed 32% of the patients tested, as opposed to 2% of controls, were unable to complete the task (significant at P<0.01, chi(2)). The youngest group of patients (children aged 5-7 years) presented consistently with lower (or similar) displacement and lower velocity measures. This phenomenon has been observed in healthy children, however, in patients, these trends were magnified and beyond the normal age range in healthy children. The velocity values were significantly different from the other patient groups (normalized values for velocity; P<0.01). These observations then manifested as higher sway values when patients were challenged with a difficult task with their eyes closed. We propose that survivors of childhood ALL have delayed motor development compared to age-matched controls giving rise to impairment in balance and postural control.

Since 1998, about 2,500 patients have received UCB transplants for a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases. The vast majority of recipients were children with an average weight of 20 kg, however more than 500 UCB transplantations have already been performed in adults. The ""naive"" nature of UCB lymphocytes may explain the lower incidence and severity of graft versus host disease encountered in UCBT compared to the allogeneic transplant setting. Furthermore, UCB is rich in primitive CD16-CD56++ natural killer cells, which possess significant proliferative and cytotoxic capacities and can be expanded using interleukin-12 or 15, so as to mount a substantial graft versus leukemia effect. The major disadvantage of UCB is the low yield of stem cells, resulting in higher graft failure rates and slower time to engraftment compared to bone marrow transplantation. A rational approach thus involves ex vivo expansion of UCB-derived hematopoietic precursors.",,"['Cohen, Yossi', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Cohen Y', 'Nagler A']","['Institute of Hematology, Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cord Blood Bank, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Israel,Isr Med Assoc J,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,100930740,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'CD56 Antigen/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fetal Blood/physiology/*transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-15/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/01/27 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2004/01/27 05:00'],"['2004/01/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr Med Assoc J. 2004 Jan;6(1):39-46.,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical overlap with Schwartz-Jampel type 2 syndrome (SJS2) has suggested that SWS and SJS2 could be allelic disorders. Through studying a series of 19 families with SWS/SJS2, we have mapped the disease gene to chromosome 5p13.1 at locus D5S418 (Zmax=10.66 at theta =0) and have identified null mutations in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR or gp190 chain) gene. A total of 14 distinct mutations were identified in the 19 families. An identical frameshift insertion (653_654insT) was identified in families from the United Arab Emirates, suggesting a founder effect in that region. It is interesting that 12/14 mutations predicted premature termination of translation. Functional studies indicated that these mutations alter the stability of LIFR messenger RNA transcripts, resulting in the absence of the LIFR protein and in the impairment of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in patient cells. We conclude, therefore, that SWS and SJS2 represent a single clinically and genetically homogeneous condition due to null mutations in the LIFR gene on chromosome 5p13.",,"['Dagoneau, Nathalie', 'Scheffer, Deborah', 'Huber, Celine', 'Al-Gazali, Lihadh I', 'Di Rocco, Maja', 'Godard, Anne', 'Martinovic, Jelena', 'Raas-Rothschild, Annick', 'Sigaudy, Sabine', 'Unger, Sheila', 'Nicole, Sophie', 'Fontaine, Bertrand', 'Taupin, Jean-Luc', 'Moreau, Jean-Francois', 'Superti-Furga, Andrea', 'Le Merrer, Martine', 'Bonaventure, Jacky', 'Munnich, Arnold', 'Legeai-Mallet, Laurence', 'Cormier-Daire, Valerie']","['Dagoneau N', 'Scheffer D', 'Huber C', 'Al-Gazali LI', 'Di Rocco M', 'Godard A', 'Martinovic J', 'Raas-Rothschild A', 'Sigaudy S', 'Unger S', 'Nicole S', 'Fontaine B', 'Taupin JL', 'Moreau JF', 'Superti-Furga A', 'Le Merrer M', 'Bonaventure J', 'Munnich A', 'Legeai-Mallet L', 'Cormier-Daire V']","['Department of Medical Genetics and INSERM U393, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA Primers', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Osteochondrodysplasias/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF']",2004/01/24 05:00,2004/04/07 05:00,['2004/01/24 05:00'],"['2003/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9297(07)61840-0 [pii]', '10.1086/381715 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 2004 Feb;74(2):298-305. doi: 10.1086/381715.

In order to better understand the physiology of Ubc9 protein we examined its levels in several rat tissues. Immunoblot analyses performed on tissue extracts revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the expression pattern of Ubc9. The Ubc9 protein was present at a high level in spleen and lung. Moderate level of Ubc9 was detected in kidney and liver. Low amount of Ubc9 was observed in brain, whereas the 18 kDa band of Ubc9 was barely visible or absent in heart and skeletal muscle. In heart and muscle extracts the Ubc9 antibodies recognized a 38 kDa protein band. This band was not visible in extracts of other rat tissues. A comparison of the relative levels of Ubc9 mRNA and protein indicated that the overall expression level of Ubc9 was the highest in spleen and lung. In spleen, lung, kidney, brain, liver and heart there was a good correlation between the 18 kDa protein and Ubc9 mRNA levels. In skeletal muscle the Ubc9 mRNA level was unproportionally high comparing to the level of the 18 kDa protein.

The effects of MTBITC are leukemic-cell-specific and consist of derangements in a critical point of cell-cycle control (G2/M transition). In fact, an increase in the proportion of G2 cells (from about 18% to 50%) was apparent following 24 h of treatment, associated with a decrease in the protein expression of cyclin B1. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 was more mildly attenuated by MTBITC. Our results demonstrated that high concentrations of MTBITC can also induce apoptosis, through an increase of p53 and bax, but not bcl-2, protein expression. No effects of MTBITC were demonstrated on non-transformed T lymphocytes.

However, it is not clear whether the mechanism of resistance to TRAIL is constitutive or inductive. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the resistant mechanisms to TRAIL at different levels in the apoptotic pathway. The human T-lymphoblastic leukemic CEM cell line showed more resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with the human chronic myeloid leukemic K562 cell line. Lower level of constitutive caspase-8 expression in the CEM cell line led to a poor response to both TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-3 and reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). There was no significant difference in the constitutive levels of NF-kappaB in CEM and K562 cell lines. However, CEM cells showed a faster response to TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation than K562 cells. TRAIL-induced regulation of Bcl-2 family of proteins included an up-regulation in Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and a down-regulation in Bax. IAPs, such as XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and Survivin were all up-regulated during the treatment with TRAIL. In summary, our data suggest that the leukemic cells resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis might be due to the deficiency in the constitutive caspase-8 expression.

METHODS: Employees from 1981 to 1996 were traced through the Australian National Death Index and the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House. Cause specific mortality and cancer incidence were compared with those of the Australian population by means of standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs). Associations between increased incidence of specific cancers and employment in the petroleum industry were tested by trends according to period of first employment, duration of employment, latency, and hydrocarbon exposure, adjusting for personal smoking history where appropriate. Total follow up time was 176 598 person-years for males and 10 253 person-years for females. RESULTS: A total of 692 of the 15 957 male subjects, and 16 of the 1206 female subjects had died by the cut off date, 31 December 1996. In males, the all-cause SMR and the SMRs for all major disease categories were significantly below unity. There was a non-significant increase of the all-cancer SIR (1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11). There was a significant increase of the incidence of melanoma (SIR 1.54, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.81), bladder cancer (SIR 1.37, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.83), and prostate cancer (SIR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.40), and a marginally significant excess of pleural mesothelioma (SIR 1.80, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.22), leukaemia (SIR 1.39, 95%CI 0.91 to 2.02), and multiple myeloma (SIR 1.72, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.84). CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of mesothelioma are probably related to past exposure to asbestos in refineries. The melanoma excess may be the result of early diagnosis.

Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The Nf1 gene encodes neurofibromin, which can function as a Ras GTPase-activating protein. Neurofibromin deficiency in mice leads to mid-gestation lethality due to cardiovascular defects. We have previously shown that conditional inactivation of Nf1 using Tie2-Cre recapitulates the heart defects seen in Nf1(-/-) embryos. Tie2-Cre transgenic mice express Cre recombinase in all endothelial cells. Here, we show that Tie2-Cre-mediated deletion of Nf1 also leads to excision of Nf1 in the hematopoietic lineage.

It is unclear whether the self-renewal of leukemic blasts results from the cumulative effects of blocked differentiation and impaired apoptosis or whether there are mechanisms directly increasing self-renewal. The AML-associated translocation products (AATPs) promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RAR alpha), promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)/RAR alpha (X-RAR alpha), and AML-1/ETO block hematopoietic differentiation. The AATPs activate the Wnt signaling by up-regulating gamma-catenin. Activation of the Wnt signaling augments self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Therefore, we investigated how AATPs influence self-renewal of HSCs and evaluated the role of gamma-catenin in the determination of the phenotype of HSCs expressing AATPs. Here we show that the AATPs directly activate the gamma-catenin promoter. The crucial role of gamma-catenin in increasing the self-renewal of HSCs upon expression of AATPs is demonstrated by (i) the abrogation of replating efficiency upon hindrance of gamma-catenin expression through RNA interference, and (ii) the augmentation of replating efficiency of HSCs upon overexpression of gamma-catenin itself. In addition, the inoculation of gamma-catenin-transduced HSCs into irradiated recipient mice establishes the clinical picture of AML. These data provide the first evidence that the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling by the AATP decisively contributes to the pathogenesis of AML.",,"['Zheng, Xiaomin', 'Beissert, Tim', 'Kukoc-Zivojnov, Natasa', 'Puccetti, Elena', 'Altschmied, Joachim', 'Strolz, Corinna', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Gul, Hilal', 'Schneider, Orinta', 'Ottmann, Oliver Gerhard', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Henschler, Reinhard', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Zheng X', 'Beissert T', 'Kukoc-Zivojnov N', 'Puccetti E', 'Altschmied J', 'Strolz C', 'Boehrer S', 'Gul H', 'Schneider O', 'Ottmann OG', 'Hoelzer D', 'Henschler R', 'Ruthardt M']","['Medizinische Klinik III/Abteilung Hamatologie, Laboratorium fur Experimentelle Hamatolgie, Johan Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Desmoplakins)', '0 (JUP protein, human)', '0 (Jup protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (gamma Catenin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Desmoplakins', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Proteins', '*Zebrafish Proteins', 'gamma Catenin']",2004/01/24 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/01/24 05:00'],"['2004/01/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-09-3335 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43751-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 May 1;103(9):3535-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-09-3335.

As we already reported, when some homo-phosphodiester polynucleotide (for example, poly(dA) or poly(C)) is added to the schizophyllan/DMSO solution and subsequently DMSO is exchanged for water, the single chain of schizophyllan forms a complex with the polynucleotide. Furthermore, we have already demonstrated that one of the potential applications of this novel complex is an antisense-oligonucleotide (AS ODN) carrier. This work describes a versatile and universal modification technique which enables us to introduce various functional groups only to the side chain of schizophyllan. This technique consists of periodate oxidation of the glucose side chain (it does not react with the main chain because of the absence of the 1,2-diol group in beta-(1-->3)-glucan) and subsequent introduction of the functional groups into the formyl terminate. In the present work, the introduced functional groups were spermine, octa-arginine (R8), arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide (RGD) and some amino or alpha-amino acid compounds. Using these compounds, we made the complexes and carried out an in vitro antisense assay for them, administrating a phosphorothioate AS ODN to the melanoma A375 or leukemia HL-60 cell lines to depress their c-myb mRNA. When we used the R8 or RGD modified schizophyllan as the antisense carrier, the antisense effect was most enhanced among others. Their superiority can be ascribed to enhancement of endocytosis due to these functional peptides. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity for these two modified schizophyllans was negligibly as small as the natural (unmodified) schizophyllan. One of the peculiar features of our system is that the complex (i.e., carrier+AS ODN) is charged negatively in total, which is different from the conventional systems. The present work has thus clarified that schizophyllan can act as a new potential candidate for AS ODN carriers.",,"['Matsumoto, Takahiro', 'Numata, Munenori', 'Anada, Takahisa', 'Mizu, Masami', 'Koumoto, Kazuya', 'Sakurai, Kazuo', 'Nagasaki, Takeshi', 'Shinkai, Seiji']","['Matsumoto T', 'Numata M', 'Anada T', 'Mizu M', 'Koumoto K', 'Sakurai K', 'Nagasaki T', 'Shinkai S']","['Faculty of Engineering, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyushu University 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '10450-60-9 (Periodic Acid)', '7F763NNC9X (Sizofiran)', 'B45A1BUM4Q (metaperiodate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Genetic Therapy', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Periodic Acid', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sizofiran/administration & dosage/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Thionucleotides/chemistry']",2004/01/24 05:00,2004/03/10 05:00,['2004/01/24 05:00'],"['2004/01/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0304416503002162 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2003.10.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Jan 22;1670(2):91-104. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2003.10.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these processes may be mediated through the gp130 receptor complex. Patients with heart failure have increased cardiac gene expression of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that signals through the gp130 receptor. The aim of this study was to identify alterations in gene expression in LIF-stimulated neonatal cardiomyocytes. METHODS: Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old Wistar rats and stimulated for 48 h with LIF. Gene expression was examined by repeated cDNA filter array analysis (n = 5) and key results verified by complementary methods. RESULTS: In LIF-stimulated cultures we observed increased cell area and changes in gene expression. The intracellular signal regulators signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, protein kinase Cdelta and the transcription factor ID1 were upregulated. Adenylyl cyclase V was downregulated. LIF also induced altered expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Receptor genes for tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-4, neurotensin and somatostatin were upregulated. Finally, LIF reduced the expression of components in the adenosine triphosphate synthase complex, epidermal fatty acid-binding protein and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1 and 6.

Immunological abnormalities include hypogammaglobulinemia, impaired immunoglobulin class switching and diminished germinal center formation. This state of immune suppression renders B-CLL patients highly susceptible to infections, which contribute greatly to morbidity and mortality in this disease. Impaired T cell function in B-CLL is well-documented and has been suggested to result from inhibitory effects exerted by malignant B lymphocytes. Because the presence of leukemic cells may represent a major obstacle to efficient T cell activation, T lymphocytes were separated from CLL B cells, stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin for 4h, and then cocultured with autologous leukemic B cells both at a 1:1 ratio or at the same ratio as in vivo for 24-40 h. CLL B cell expression of CD86 and CD95 was markedly upregulated using this approach, whereas CD80 expression was augmented only in a minority of patients; these effects were partially preserved even when preactivated T cells were rechallenged with CLL B cells at the same low T/B cell ratio as that observed in vivo. Finally, CD80 upregulation on CLL B cells appeared to be mainly dependent on CD40L-mediated stimulation, whereas CD86 and CD95 expression was efficiently augmented by soluble factors released by preactivated T lymphocytes.

Fludarabine and its combination with mitoxantrone and/or cyclophosphamide, which is the most effective treatment in younger patients, has not been extensively utilized in the elderly CLL. Here we report our results with fludarabine-based chemotherapy in 32 previously treated patients over the age of 65 years. The overall response rate was 59% with no complete remission, 3 nodular partial remissions and 16 partial remissions. The median time to progression of disease was 7 months. Only 10 patients completed the entire treatment program, because of poor compliance due to toxicity. Eight patients developed neutropenic fever, 14 severe bacterial infections and 2 patients showed progressive encephalopathy. For comparison, in a younger group of patients with refractory CLL (< 65 years), 38 of 50 patients completed the treatment plan, and the ORR was 80% (10 CR, 11 PR-nodular, 19 PR) with a median response of 12 months. Neutropenic fever was diagnosed in 10 and severe bacterial infection in 4 patients. In conclusion, fludarabine-based chemotherapy is effective for refractory CLL, however, excessive toxicity such as severe infections and neurological complications, do not allow completion of treatment in the majority of the elderly patients.

It is associated with immune deficiency, cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, and high susceptibility to lymphoid malignancies due to a defect in DNA double strand break repair. Since genetic instability has been discussed as a cause in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with complex chromosomal aberrations, mutations in the NBS1 gene might be found in this AML subgroup. In this study, we analyzed 19 patients with AML and complex chromosomal aberrations for mutations in the NBS1 gene. Tumor DNA was analyzed by dHPLC analysis and all amplicons showing shifts were directly sequenced. One sample was found to be heterozygous for a novel 5 bp deletion in intron 12 (IVS12-53del5). By RT-PCR analysis the expected transcript and an additional faint product with skipped exon 13 was observed, indicative of aberrant splicing. This exon codes for part of the binding site of the NBS1 gene product, nibrin, to MRE11. However, we also found that all controls showed this phenomenon. Thus, the IVS12-53del5 is not responsible for the skipping of exon 13 and most probably represents a rare polymorphism. We found no further NBS1 mutations among the AML samples.

Over the years, three sets of observations have spurred interest in the function of retinoids with respect to development and disease of hematopoietic cells. Since the 1920s, epidemiological studies indicated altered hematopoiesis in vitamin A-deficient (VAD) human populations. More recently, the ability of retinoids to affect various aspects of hematopoietic development has been demonstrated in vitro. Finally, it was discovered that the gene encoding a retinoid receptor is a key target for chromosomal translocations that cause acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). More recent investigations using targeted gene disruptions, VAD animal models, and mouse models of leukemia have continued to shed light on the function of the retinoid pathway in blood cells. It is now clear that retinoids are required for normal hematopoiesis during both yolk sac and fetal liver stages of hematopoiesis, while the pathway has at least modulatory functions for bone marrow derived progenitors.

In AML, numerous recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified, and several of them, e.g. t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(15;17)(q22;q11-12), inv(16)(p13q22), are specific for distinct subgroups. Furthermore, chromosomal aberrations have proved to be of paramount prognostic importance for remission induction and survival. Chromosome analysis using classical cytogenetic banding techniques often fails to completely resolve complex karyotypes and cryptic translocations not identifiable by these techniques have been detected using molecular cytogenetic methods. While fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become an indispensable tool for screening and follow-up of known aberrations, the techniques of spectral karyotyping (SKY) and multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) allow for the simultaneous visualization of all chromosomes of a metaphase in a single hybridization step, and thereby enable screening for the aberrations present without their prior knowledge. Therefore, with the introduction of these techniques in 1996 the comprehensive analysis of complex karyotypes and the identification of new, hitherto cryptic translocations and, ultimately, the identification of new disease subgroups seemed possible.

Two types of lymphocyte cultures were carried out--nonstimulated and stimulated with mitogen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A concentration assay of substances mentioned above was made using ready immuno-enzymatic sets of the ELISA type. RESULTS: In all cases, plasma concentrations of IL-8, E-selectin and VCAM-1 were the highest in III stage of CLL and moderately increased in I stage comparing to control. The concentrations of IL-8 in culture supernatants and in broken lymphocytes and concentration of VCAM-1 in lymphocytes were increased in both stages of CLL. In contrast concentrations of E-selectin were decreased in lymphocytes in both types of culture. Significant decrease of E-selectin and VCAM-1 concentrations were observed in supernatants of nonstimulated cultures. CONCLUSION: Significant increase of E-selectin, IL-8 and VCAM-1 concentration in blood plasma may support higher activity and suggest the higher ability of leukaemic lymphocytes to migration. Increased IL-8 concentration in isolated, broken, stimulated lymphocytes may be a characteristic feature of the biochemical processes of leukaemic lymphocytes.

Small molecular weight cell membrane-permeable drugs that target these pathways have been developed for leukemia therapy. One such example is imatinib mesylate, which targets the BCR-ABL kinase as well as a few structurally related kinases. This drug has proven to be effective in the treatment of CML patients. However, leukemic cells have evolved mechanisms to become resistant to this drug. A means to combat drug resistance is to target other prominent signaling components involved in the pathway or to inhibit BCR-ABL by other mechanisms. Treatment of imatinib-resistant leukemia cells with drugs that target Ras (farnysyl transferase inhibitors) or with the protein destabilizer geldanamycin has proven to be a means to inhibit the growth of resistant cells.

We have assessed the effect of C/EBPalphap30 on granulopoiesis utilizing C/EBPalphap30-ER, containing the estradiol receptor ligand-binding domain. In contrast to C/EBPalpha-ER, C/EBPalphap30-ER did not induce 32Dcl3 myeloid cell differentiation in IL-3. However, both isoforms, when expressed at high levels, were capable of inhibiting E2F activity in 32Dcl3 cells and of slowing their G1 to S progression. C/EBPalphap30 repressed expression of the endogenous G-CSF receptor several-fold. To facilitate investigation of the effect of C/EBPalphap30-ER on granulopoiesis downstream of G-CSF signalling, we coexpressed exogenous G-CSF receptor. C/EBPalphap30-ER/GR cells expressed several granulocytic markers in G-CSF and demonstrated nuclear maturation. Rat C/EBPalpha-ER and C/EBPalphap30-ER, expressed in 293T cells, bound the C/EBP site from the NE gene with similar affinity, as did human C/EBPalpha and C/EBPalphap30. In contrast, C/EBPalphap30 bound the C/EBP sites in the PU.1 or GR gene with 3-6-fold reduced affinity. Thus, the selective inhibition of GR expression by C/EBPalphap30-ER is due in part to its variable affinity for C/EBP sites.

The contribution of non-Bcl2 mechanisms in this process is currently unknown. In this report, overexpression of PKC alpha was found not to affect cell proliferation, cell cycle, or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The failure of PKC alpha overexpression to activate non-Bcl2 survival pathways suggested that PKC alpha-mediated chemoresistance requires Bcl2. Supporting this notion, REH/PKC alpha transfectants were found to be as sensitive to HA14-1 (a drug that targets Bcl2 function) as parental cells. In addition, HA14-1 abrogated PKC alpha's ability to protect REH cells from etoposide. These findings suggested that Bcl2 is necessary for the protective function of PKC alpha in REH cells. Since Bcl2 phosphorylation status is negatively regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PP2A regulates PKC alpha, we investigated whether PKC alpha can conversely regulate PP2A. Overexpression of PKC alpha was found to suppress mitochondrial PP2A activity by a mechanism that, at least in part, involves suppressed expression of the regulatory subunit comprising the Bcl2 phosphatase (ie the PP2A/B56 alpha subunit).

After AML transformation, FLT3/ITD was also associated with an adverse prognosis. One patient had FLT3/TKD mutation (D835Y) at both MDS and AML stages. Additional three acquired FLT3/TKD (one each with D835 H, D835F and I836S) at AML transformation. Five of the 70 matched samples had N-ras mutation at diagnosis of MDS compared to 15 at AML transformation (P<0.001), one lost and 11 gained N-ras mutations at AML progression. Coexistence of FLT3/TKD and N-ras mutations was found in two AML samples. N-ras mutations had no prognostic impact either at the MDS or AML stage. Our results show that one-third of MDS patients acquire activating mutations of FLT3 or N-ras gene during AML evolution and FLT3/ITD predicts a poor outcome in MDS.",,"['Shih, L-Y', 'Huang, C-F', 'Wang, P-N', 'Wu, J-H', 'Lin, T-L', 'Dunn, P', 'Kuo, M-C']","['Shih LY', 'Huang CF', 'Wang PN', 'Wu JH', 'Lin TL', 'Dunn P', 'Kuo MC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. sly7012@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/01/23 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/01/23 05:00'],"['2004/01/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403274 [doi]', '2403274 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Mar;18(3):466-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that leukemic blasts from selected patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were able to differentiate in vitro into cells with DC features. In order to identify genes differentially expressed in leukemia-derived DCs (AML-DCs), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based subtraction approach was applied using cDNA from AML-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs from healthy donors as competitors. In the 548 sequences analyzed, 80% corresponded to fibronectin (FN) gene fragments. Overexpression of FN in AML-DCs was demonstrated both by semiquantitative PCR analysis and by immunostaining. In addition, we could show that FN was secreted by AML-DCs. Indeed, FN overexpression was already detectable in AML blasts of M4 and M5 subtype, and was significantly induced during DC differentiation after culture.

Although defective apoptosis and poor metabolism often cause resistance to treatment, differential uptake and/or export of nucleosides and nucleotides may significantly modulate intracellular drug bioavailability and, consequently, responsiveness to therapy. Two gene families, SLC28 and SLC29, encode transporter proteins responsible for concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside uptake (CNT and ENT, respectively). Furthermore, selected members of the expanding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family have recently been identified as putative efflux pumps for the phosphorylated forms of these nucleoside-derived drugs, ABCC11 (MRP8) being a good candidate to modulate cell sensitivity to fluoropyrimidines. Sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine has also been recently correlated with ENT-type transport function, suggesting that, besides the integrity of apoptotic pathways and appropriate intracellular metabolism, transport across the plasma membrane is also a relevant event during CLL treatment.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is thought to reflect the transformation of a primitive stem cell compartment. The resultant 'cancer stem cells' comprise only a minor portion of the leukemic clone but give rise through differentiation to more committed progenitors as well as differentiated blasts that constitute the bulk of the tumor. The maintenance of the leukemic clone is dependent on the self-renewal capacity of the cancer stem cell compartment, which is revealed by its ability to re-initiate leukemia in a transplant setting. The cellular basis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is however less clear. APL has traditionally been considered to be the most differentiated form of AML and to arise from a committed myeloid progenitor.

In the present study, we investigated the effects and action mechanisms of woodfordin I, a macrocyclic ellagitannin dimer, on human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells. The results showed that woodfordin I was able to suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis in K562 cells. Apoptosis was evaluated by cytomorphology, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Woodfordin I treatment caused a rapid and sustained loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP), transient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c. The activation of caspase-9 and 3, but not caspase-8, was also demonstrated, indicating that the apoptotic signaling triggered by woodfordin I was mediated through the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels were downregulated, together with the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. Significantly, woodfordin I-induced apoptosis was associated with a decline in the levels of c-Abl, Bcr-Abl, and cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Considering the consequence of all the events in the process of woodfordin I-induced apoptosis, the mitochondrial dysfunction is directly responsible for the pro-apoptotic effects on K562 cells. Furthermore, because CML is a malignancy of pleuripotent hematopoietic cells caused by the dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl, these findings suggest that woodfordin I may be a potential lead compound against CML.",,"['Liu, Ming-Jie', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Li, Hai-Xia', 'Wu, Rong-Cong', 'Liu, Yan-Ze', 'Wu, Qing-Yu']","['Liu MJ', 'Wang Z', 'Li HX', 'Wu RC', 'Liu YZ', 'Wu QY']","['Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tannins)', '126347-63-5 (woodfordin C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', '*Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Structures', 'Tannins/*toxicity', '*Woodfordia']",2004/01/23 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/01/23 05:00'],"['2004/01/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0041008X03004174 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2003.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2004 Jan 15;194(2):141-55. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2003.08.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisense DENN oligodeoxynucleotide treatment of K36 cells in vitro induced extensive apoptosis, while antisense DENN silencing of K36 tumor-bearing mice caused significant tumor regression in vivo. Compared to wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts, antisense treatment of NFkappaB and TNFR1 KO cells resulted in markedly more pronounced cell death, whereas antisense-treated TNFalpha and TNFR2 knockouts exhibited less prominent apoptosis. Cell viability and apoptosis were authenticated by flow cytometry, membrane integrity, TUNEL, annexin V assays, histology and electron microscopy. Antisense abrogation of DENN expression culminated in upregulated expression of TNFR2, TRAIL and Fas, but downregulation of TNFalpha, TNFR1 and cyclin D3. Conversely, DENN overexpression stimulated cell proliferation and led to upregulated TRPM2 and cyclin B1, but diminished expression of Fas, TNFR2, TRAIL and Egr-1. The participation of TNFalpha, TNFR1, TNFR2 and Fas in the inhibition of DENN expression was also demonstrated.

Abnormalities in this network may result in a variety of blood disorders; however, the role of this network is not clear in leukemia. The use of antineoplastic agents has improved the survival rate of some types of leukemia, and adjunctive therapy with cytokines may be helpful. Chemotherapeutic approaches are no longer the best choice because cytotoxicity may affect normal and leukemic cells, and leukemic cells may develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent. Induction of differentiation to a mature phenotype and the control of apoptotic-gene expression have provided other possible alternative therapies. Combined effects of cytokines and vitamin derivatives such as retinoic acid (RA) and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) were found more beneficial than any of these agents individually. These agents exhibit cooperative effects, potentiate each other's effects, or both. Therefore, understanding the hematopoietic actions of these agents, their interactions with their receptors, and their differentiation signaling pathways may result in the design of new therapies. However, the role of cytokines in apoptosis is controversial because in some cases they were found to increase tumor cell resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents. Recent studies in the molecular biology of gene regulation, transcription factors, and repressors have led to new possible approaches such as differentiation therapy for the treatment of leukemia. In addition, the development of drugs that act on the molecular level such as imatinib is just the beginning of a new era in molecular targeted therapy in which the drug acts specifically on the leukemic cell. There are many possible combinations of cytokines, retinoids, and VD3, and perhaps the best therapeutic combination is yet to be described.

Analysis of the generated sequences demonstrated that the original clonotypes are rarely encountered in normal control samples; however, high levels of homology were found in both controls and patients.

Previous sst scintigraphy studies revealed that malignant lymphomas can also be visualized using this technique. The question has been addressed whether lymphomas might also be possible targets for radiotherapy using radionuclide-labeled SS analogs. Therefore, we investigated in vitro the characteristics of lymphoma tissues and lymphoid cell lines to evaluate whether lymphomas can be targets for radiotherapy. METHODS: Six orbital lymphomas, 2 Hodgkin's lymphomas, and 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas from the neck region were collected. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to detect and quantify the expression of sst(1-5) mRNA. Receptor autoradiography studies using [(125)I-Tyr(3)]octreotide were performed to evaluate binding to sst on cryostat sections of lymphomas. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate expression of sst(2) and sst(3). Membrane binding studies and in vitro internalization experiments using [(125)I-Tyr(3)]octreotide were performed to study binding and uptake of [(125)I-Tyr(3)]octreotide by lymphoid cell lines (JY, TMM, APD) and primary cells derived from a B-cell-derived chronic lymphatic leukemia. RESULTS: A selective expression of sst(2) and sst(3) messenger RNA (mRNA) was demonstrated. By quantitative RT-PCR, expression levels of sst(2) and sst(3) mRNA were relatively low. Autoradiography studies revealed low binding of [(125)I-Tyr(3)]octreotide, whereas immunoreactivity could not be detected for sst(2) and sst(3) by immunohistochemistry. On the lymphoid cell lines only low numbers of high-affinity SS binding sites were found. In vitro, uptake of [(125)I-Tyr(3)]octreotide by these cells was also very low. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our findings, we conclude that lymphomas do not appear to be candidates for radiotherapy using radionuclide-labeled SS analogs.

We show here that macropinosome rocketing can be induced by hyperosmotic shock, either alone or synergistically when combined with phorbol ester or pervanadate. Rocketing was blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(s), p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and calcium, suggesting the involvement of phosphoinositide signaling. Since various phosphoinositides are enriched on inwardly mobile vesicles, we examined whether or not annexin 2 binds to any of this class of phospholipid. In liposome sedimentation assays, we show that recombinant annexin 2 binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5P(2)) but not to other poly- and mono-phosphoinositides. The affinity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P(2) (K(D) approximately 5 microm) is comparable with those reported for a variety of PtdIns-4,5P(2)-binding proteins and is enhanced in the presence of Ca(2+). Although annexin 1 also bound to PtdIns-4,5P(2), annexin 5 did not, indicating that this is not a generic annexin property. To test whether annexin 2 binds to PtdIns-4,5P(2) in vivo, we microinjected rat basophilic leukemia cells stably expressing annexin 2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) with fluorescently tagged antibodies to PtdIns-4,5P(2). Annexin 2-GFP and anti-PtdIns-4,5P(2) IgG co-localize at sites of pinosome formation, and annexin 2-GFP relocalizes to intracellular membranes in Ptk cells microinjected with Arf6Q67L, which has been shown to stimulate PtdIns-4,5P(2) synthesis on pinosomes through activation of phosphatidylinositol 5 kinase.

Cytogenetic response was determined based on the percentage of Ph(+) cells from bone marrow following a median of 13 months of treatment. RESULTS: A genomic profile of response was developed using a subset of individuals that exhibited the greatest divergence in cytogenetic response; those with complete response (0% Ph(+) cells; n = 53) and those with minimal or no response (>65% Ph(+) cells; n = 13). A total of 55 genes was identified that were differentially expressed between these two groups. Using a ""leave-one-out"" strategy, we identified the optimum 31 genes from this list to use as our genomic profile of response. Using this genomic profile, we were able to distinguish between individuals that achieved major cytogenetic response (0-35% Ph(+) cells) and those that did not, with a sensitivity of 93.4% (71 of 76 patients), specificity of 58.3% (14 of 24 patients), positive predictive value of 87.7%, and negative predictive value of 73.7%.

Little information is available on interleukin-18 receptor (IL-18R) and IL-18 expression in normal and malignant B cells. Our purpose was to investigate this issue in human naive, germinal center (GC) and memory B cells, and in their neoplastic counterparts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have evaluated IL-18 expression and production in tonsil naive, GC, and memory B cells and in their presumed neoplastic counterparts by reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA. Moreover, IL-18Ralpha and beta expression was investigated in the same cells by reverse transcription-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found that: (a) IL-18 mRNA was expressed in tonsil naive, GC, and memory B cells. Bioactive IL-18 was secreted by naive and GC, but not by memory B cells; (b) IL-18Ralpha and beta transcripts were expressed in the three B-cell subsets. IL-18Ralpha was detected on the surface of naive, GC, and memory B lymphocytes, and IL-18Rbeta was detected on GC and memory, but not naive, B cells; (c) mantle zone, follicular, marginal zone, Burkitt lymphoma (BL), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells expressed IL-18 mRNA. B-CLL and BL cells did not produce bioactive IL-18; and (d) lymphoma B cells displayed heterogeneous expression of either or both IL-18R chain mRNA.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The outcome of 261 patients with Ph-positive chronic phase CML post-IFN failure treated with imatinib was compared with 204 historical control patients treated for a similar disease status with existing therapies. A subset of 147 patients in late chronic phase CML and 100% Ph-positive status treated with imatinib was compared with 95 patients in a similar disease status treated with IFN. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the independent prognostic effect of therapy (imatinib versus other) on survival. RESULTS: In the first analysis involving 261 patients on imatinib plus 204 historical patients, the complete cytogenetic response rates were 62% and 19%, respectively (P < 0.001). A multivariate analysis identified pretreatment peripheral blasts and thrombocytosis to be independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Imatinib therapy (versus others) was a significant independent favorable prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio, 0.17; P < 0.0001). In the second analysis involving the subset of 147 patients receiving imatinib plus 95 historical patients treated with IFN regimens, the complete cytogenetic response rates were 41% and 7%, respectively (P < 0.001). A multivariate analysis selected pretreatment anemia and peripheral blasts to be significant independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Imatinib therapy (versus IFN) was an independent favorable prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio, 0.20; P < 0.0001). Three-month and 6-month landmark analyses showed that patients in all cytogenetic response categories (major, minor, and none) after imatinib therapy had survival outcomes better than the historical control population. Within each cytogenetic response category, survival was also better with imatinib than with other therapies. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides evidence for a survival advantage with imatinib versus other therapies in chronic-phase CML post-IFN failure, and for a survival advantage with imatinib versus IFN in late chronic-phase CML.",,"['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Wierda, William', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Giles F', 'Shan J', 'Rios MB', 'Faderl S', 'Verstovsek S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Wierda W', 'Kornblau S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Keating M', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/01/22 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2004/01/22 05:00'],"['2004/01/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-1035-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jan 1;10(1 Pt 1):68-75. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-1035-3.,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jan 1;10(1 Pt 1):1-3.

We have identified seven cases with trisomy 5 as the sole or primary chromosomal abnormality from a total of 3,400 karyotypes collected in the Leukaemia Research Fund UK Cancer Cytogenetics Group Karyotype Database.

The apoptosis was determined by (a) apoptotic morphology in microscopy; (b) DNA fragmentation in electrophoresis and FACS analysis; and (c) activation of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage assay. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activity of PTF in HL-60 cells was increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. PTF caused the cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing, apoptotic body and DNA fragmentation. PTF-induced apoptosis is accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and the specific proteolytic cleavage of PARP. However, PTF did not show cytotoxicity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Because mature blast cells of AML have very limited proliferative capacity, it is believed that the leukemic clone is perpetuated by a rare population of leukemia stem cells (LSC) that have acquired a dramatic increase in their ability to self-renew. Elucidating the nature of the target cell that undergoes leukemic transformation and the resultant LSC that can initiate and maintain AML is essential for both the understanding of the leukemogenic process and for the design of effective therapies. However, identifying such cells using only clinical data from human subjects has been difficult due to obvious restriction in experimental intervention in humans. In addition, before clinical symptoms are presented, it is virtually impossible to acquire a complete picture of the early events in leukemogenesis. Other experimental approaches involved the study of naturally occurring or induced animal (murine) leukemias. While many aspects of these animal leukemias reproduced the human disease, there were also inconsistencies. The advent of xenotransplantation to accurately model human AML growing within an animal system has provided an important tool to begin to answer the fundamental questions regarding AML. This review will examine the work done using the xenograft system to characterize the nature of the leukemic clone and will specifically highlight the advances made in phenotypically, molecularly, and functionally defining the LSC.

In the present study a panel of NLS peptides that bind different transport receptors were compared for their ability to enhance nonviral gene transfer. Several factors such as method of incorporating the NLS peptide, type of NLS peptide, DNA morphology, and proper characterization of NLS peptide/DNA conjugates were identified as important considerations in utilizing NLS peptides to enhance gene transfer. In particular, it was shown that a peptide derived from human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV) was able to effectively condense DNA into discrete particles and mediate levels of transgene expression up to 32-fold greater than polylysine-based polyplexes. This is the first study to demonstrate efficient transfection mediated by an importin beta-binding peptide based on the HTLV sequence.

Abeta peptides are proteolytically derived from the membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although the function of APP is not entirely clear, previous studies demonstrate that neuronal APP colocalizes with beta(1) integrin receptors at sites of focal adhesion, suggesting that APP is involved in mediating neuronal process adhesion. Integrin-dependent adhesion is also a well-characterized component of immune cell proinflammatory activation. Using primary mouse microglia and the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, we have begun investigating the role of APP in integrin-dependent activation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that APP is recruited into a multi-receptor signaling complex during beta(1) integrin-mediated adhesion of monocytes. Stimulation induces a subsequent, specific recruitment of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to APP, including Lyn and Syk. Antibody cross-linking of cell surface APP leads to a similar response characterized by activation and recruitment of tyrosine kinases to APP as well as subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and increased proinflammatory protein levels. These data demonstrate that APP can act as a proinflammatory receptor in monocytic lineage cells and provide insight into the contribution of this protein to the inflammatory conditions described in Alzheimer's disease.",,"['Sondag, Cindy M', 'Combs, Colin K']","['Sondag CM', 'Combs CK']","['University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology, Grand Forks, North Dakota 58202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Integrin beta1)']",IM,"['Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism']",2004/01/21 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2004/01/21 05:00'],"['2004/01/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M313747200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64122-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Apr 2;279(14):14456-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M313747200.

In this study, changes in the activities and gene expressions of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARG) in HL-60 cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or a PARG inhibitor, tannic acid, were investigated. Nuclear PARG activities of HL-60 cells treated with TPA were reduced to 30-40% of the activity in untreated cells at 24 h, while PARG activities in the cytoplasm remained unchanged. The transient decrease in the nuclear PARG activity by TPA treatment was accompanied by differentiation as measured by the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing activity and adhesion to the culture dishes. In the presence of H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), both the decrease in nuclear PARG activity and the induction of differentiation by TPA treatment were suppressed. On the other hand, treatment with tannic acid caused the nuclear PARG activity to decrease continuously while the NBT reducing activity increased, but no morphological differentiation to macrophage-like cells was apparent. In order to analyze PARG gene expression, we isolated the human PARG cDNA by the RT-PCR technique. RT-PCR analysis revealed that TPA treatment leads to a reduction in the PARG gene expression prior to the phenotypic expression of macrophage-like cell differentiation, which was diminished by the presence of H7. Also, PARG gene expression was reduced by tannic acid treatment. These results provide the first evidence that a transient decrease in nuclear PARG activity is important for the onset of differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophage-like cells.",,"['Uchiumi, Fumiaki', 'Ikeda, Daisuke', 'Tanuma, Sei-ichi']","['Uchiumi F', 'Ikeda D', 'Tanuma S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '64604-09-7 (12-O-tetradeca-2,4,6,8-tetranoylphorbol-13-acetate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.143 (poly ADP-ribose glycohydrolase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins/*pharmacology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/01/21 05:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2004/01/21 05:00'],"['2004/01/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0167478103002318 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbaexp.2003.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Jan 5;1676(1):1-11. doi: 10.1016/j.bbaexp.2003.10.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on the kinetics of PPIX accumulation and the mechanism of cytotoxic effects of ALA-PDT studied in the chronic myelogenous leukaemia derived cell line K562. The PPIX distribution and, consequently, cytotoxic effects were found to be heterogenous. A subpopulation of K562 cells accumulating PPIX to a lesser extent exhibits only transient cell cycle arrest. A fraction of cells, probably those with higher PPIX accumulation, are irreversibly damaged by ALA-PDT. We detected several signs of an early apoptosis: lowering of Bcl-xL expression, decrease of the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potential, the cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, and the unmasking of the mitochondrial antigen 7A6. However, late apoptotic events were lacking: neither caspase-3 activation nor DNA fragmentation occurred. Instead, rapidly progressing cell necrosis resulting from plasma membrane damage was observed.

Dok1 (downstream of tyrosine kinases) is an abundant Ras-GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP)-associated tyrosine kinase substrate, which negatively regulates cell proliferation, downregulates MAP kinase activation and promotes cell migration. The gene encoding Dok1 maps to human chromosome 2p13, a region previously found to be rearranged in B-CLL. We have screened the Dok1 gene for mutations from 46 individuals with B-CLL using heteroduplex analysis. A four-nucleotide GGCC deletion in the coding region was found in the leukemia cells from one patient. This mutation causes a frameshift leading to protein truncation at the carboxyl-terminus, with the acquisition of a novel amino-acid sequence. In contrast to the wild-type Dok1 protein, which has cytoplasmic/membrane localization, the mutant Dok1 is a nuclear protein containing a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal. Whereas overexpression of wild-type Dok1 inhibited PDGF-induced MAP kinase activation, this inhibition was not observed with the mutant Dok1. Furthermore the mutant Dok1 forms heterodimers with Dok1 wild type and the association can be enhanced by Lck-mediated tyrosine-phosphorylation.

NDR is expressed preferentially in the adult bone marrow, fetal liver and testis. Immunocytochemistry with anti-NDR antiserum showed the presence of NDR in human erythroleukemia K562 cell line and CD34+ cells sorted from the umbilical cord blood. When fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), NDR was directed to the nucleus of mouse 3T3 and K562 cells. Fusion protein with a deletion from residues 7 to 87 was detected in the cytoplasm. NDR appeared not to affect the proliferation of K562 cells when overly expressed. However, its expression was down-regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Down-regulation of NDR correlated well with up-regulation of megakaryocytic markers, CD41 and CD61. Overexpression of the nuclear NDR-GFP in K562 cells inhibited the expression of CD41 and CD61 in megakaryocytic differentiation. Treatment of K562 cells with GF-109203X (GFX), an antagonist of the protein kinase C (PKC), blocked NDR down-regulation, up-regulated expression of CD41/CD61 and TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation.

E2a/Pbx1 blocks differentiation of primary myeloid progenitors but, paradoxically, induces apoptosis in established pre-B-cell lines, and no transforming function of E2a/Pbx1 has been reported in cultured lymphoid progenitors. Here, we demonstrate that E2a/Pbx1 induces immortal proliferation of stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent pro-T thymocytes by a mechanism dependent upon both its transactivation and DNA-binding functions. E2a-Pbx1 cooperated with cytokines or activated signaling oncoproteins to induce cell division, as inactivation of conditional E2a/Pbx1 in either factor-dependent pro-T cells or pro-T cells made factor independent by expression of Bcr/Abl resulted in pro-T-cell quiescence, while reactivation of E2a/Pbx1 restored cell division. Infusion of E2a/Pbx1 pro-T cells in mice caused T lymphoblastic leukemia and, unexpectedly, acute myeloid leukemia. The acute lymphoblastic leukemia did not evidence further maturation, suggesting that E2a/Pbx1 establishes an early block in pro-T-cell development that cannot be overcome by marrow or thymic microenvironments. In an E2a/Pbx1 pro-T thymocyte clone that induced only pro-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, coexpression of Bcr/Abl expanded its leukemic phenotype to include acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting that unique functions of cooperating signaling oncoproteins can influence the lymphoid versus myeloid character of E2a/Pbx1 leukemia and may cooperate with E2a/Pbx1 to dictate the pre-B-cell phenotype of human leukemia containing t(1;19).",,"['Sykes, David B', 'Kamps, Mark P']","['Sykes DB', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tle1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.3.1256-1269.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Feb;24(3):1256-69. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.3.1256-1269.2004.,,PMC321418,"['R01 CA056876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent clinical trials have indicated, however, that allogeneic but not autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for ATL can yield better clinical outcomes. In the present study, we investigated cellular immune responses of ATL patients who obtained complete remission after nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood HSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors. In the culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a post-HSCT but not pre-HSCT ATL patient, CD8(+) CTLs proliferated vigorously in response to stimulation with autologous HTLV-I-infected T cells that had been established before HSCT in vitro. These CTLs contained a large number of monospecific CTL population directed to a HLA-A2-restricted HTLV-I Tax 11-19 epitope. The frequency of Tax 11-19-specific CD8+ CTLs in this patient markedly increased also in vivo after HSCT, as determined by staining with HLA-A2/Tax 11-19 tetramers. Similar clonal expansion of HTLV-I Tax-specific CTLs exclusively directed to a HLA-A24-restricted Tax 301-309 epitope was observed in the PBMCs from another ATL patient after HSCT from a HTLV-I-negative donor. Among four post-HSCT ATL patients tested, HTLV-I-specific CTLs were induced in the PBMC culture from three patients but not from the remaining one who had later recurrence of ATL.

In this study we investigated the role of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) beta in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3))-induced monocytic differentiation of human leukemia HL60 cells. It was found that in this system, pRb is up-regulated within 12 h of exposure to the inducer, and the kinetics of its increase parallel the appearance of the early markers of differentiation, CD14 and monocyte-specific esterase. The increase in pRb expression was accompanied by a similar increase in C/EBPbeta protein, and these two proteins coimmunoprecipitated, suggesting formation of a complex. Oligonucleotides antisense to pRb or C/EBPbeta (but not to C/EBPalpha) or containing the C/EBP-binding sequence (""decoys""), all inhibited 1,25D(3)-induced differentiation. Inhibition of signaling by vitamin D receptor or by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase pathways using pharmacological inhibitors ZK159222, PD98059, or SP600125, respectively, inhibited pRb and C/EBPbeta expression and differentiation in a coordinate manner. In contrast, inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway by SB202190 potentiated differentiation and the up-regulation of pRb and C/EBPbeta. We suggest that 1,25D(3) may signal monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells in a vitamin D receptor-dependent manner that includes activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase MAPK pathways, which then up-regulate pRb and C/EBPbeta expression and in turn initiate the differentiation process.",,"['Ji, Yan', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Ji Y', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07013, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/drug effects/*genetics', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/drug effects/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3029 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jan 1;64(1):370-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3029.,,,['R01-CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp acts as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump, reducing the intracellular concentration of structurally unrelated drugs. Modulators of P-gp function can restore the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant cells to such drugs. In the present study, we evaluated the P-gp modulatory potential of diallyl sulfide (DAS), a volatile organosulfur compound present in garlic, known to possess many medicinal properties, including antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activities. For in vitro studies, K562 leukemic cells were made resistant (K562/R) to the cytotoxicity of vinblastine (VBL) by progressive adaptation of the sensitive K562 parental cells to VBL. Cross-resistance of K562/R was found between vincristine (VCR), doxorubicin and other antineoplastic agents. A non-toxic concentration of DAS (8.75 x 10(-3) M) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of VBL and another vinca alkaloid, VCR, time dependently in VBL-resistant human leukemia (K562/R10) cells but had no effect on the parent (K562/S) cells. The results show that DAS decreased the induced levels of P-gp in resistant cells back to the normal levels as analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, in vivo combination studies showed that DAS effectively inhibited vinca alkaloid-induced P-gp overexpression in mouse hepatocytes. Quantitation of immunostained tissue sections with image analysis showed that the reduction in P-gp levels was up to 73% for VBL- and 65% for VCR-induced drug resistance. The above features thus indicate that DAS can serve as a novel, non-toxic modulator of MDR and can be used as a dietary adjuvant.",,"['Arora, Annu', 'Seth, Kavita', 'Shukla, Yogeshwer']","['Arora A', 'Seth K', 'Shukla Y']","['Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, PO Box 80, M.G.Marg, Lucknow-226001, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Sulfides)', '60G7CF7CWZ (allyl sulfide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*physiology', 'Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Liver/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgh060 [doi]', 'bgh060 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2004 Jun;25(6):941-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgh060.

Here we show that VEGF modifies the developmental potential of primitive erythroid progenitors and prolongs their life span. Furthermore, the survival of yolk sac erythrocytes in vivo depends on the dose of VEGF. Interestingly, in Vegf(lo/lo) embryos carrying a hypomorph allele, Flk1-positive cells reach the yolk sac at E8.5, but are severely compromised in their ability to generate primitive erythroid precursors. These observations indicate that during embryonic development, different thresholds of VEGF are required for the migration and clonal expansion of hematopoietic precursors. The near absence of primitive erythroid precursors in Vegf(lo/lo) embryos correlates with low levels of Scl in the yolk sac. Strikingly, gain-of-function of SCL partially complements the hematopoietic defect caused by the hypomorph Vegf(lo) allele, and re-establishes the survival of erythroid cells and the expression of erythroid genes (Gata1 and betaH1).

The previously characterized ATRX protein (approximately 280 kDa) contains both a Plant homeodomain (PHD)-like zinc finger motif as well as an ATPase domain of the SNF2 family. These motifs suggest that ATRX may function as a regulator of gene expression, probably by exerting an effect on chromatin structure, although the exact cellular role of ATRX has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we characterize a truncated (approximately 200 kDa) isoform of ATRX (called here ATRXt) that has been highly conserved between mouse and human. In both species, ATRXt arises due to the failure to splice intron 11 from the primary transcript, and the use of a proximal intronic poly(A) signal. We show that the relative expression of the full length and ATRXt isoforms is subject to tissue-specific regulation. The ATRXt isoform contains the PHD-like domain but not the SWI/SNF-like motifs and is therefore unlikely to be functionally equivalent to the full length protein. We used indirect immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the full length and ATRXt isoforms are colocalized at blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin but unlike full length ATRX, the truncated isoform does not associate with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. The high degree of conservation of ATRXt and the tight regulation of its expression relative to the full length protein suggest that this truncated isoform fulfills an important biological function.",,"['Garrick, David', 'Samara, Vassiliki', 'McDowell, Tarra L', 'Smith, Andrew J H', 'Dobbie, Lorraine', 'Higgs, Douglas R', 'Gibbons, Richard J']","['Garrick D', 'Samara V', 'McDowell TL', 'Smith AJ', 'Dobbie L', 'Higgs DR', 'Gibbons RJ']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (SMARCA2 protein, human)', '0 (Smarca2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Smarca4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Atrx protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Centromere/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Heterochromatin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Introns/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/03/18 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111903010473 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2003.10.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2004 Feb 4;326:23-34. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2003.10.026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent biochemical and crystallographic analyses have clarified the mechanisms by which growth-factor and adhesion receptors might regulate the activity of Abl family kinases. When activated, Abl family kinases can regulate cytoskeletal dynamics by phosphorylating several known cytoskeletal regulatory proteins. In addition, the C-terminal half of Abl family kinases has several domains that bind to cytoskeletal components.

Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor prevented the PMA-induced SPHK1 gene expression. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of this gene expression, we examined the promoter area (distal to the first exon) and its binding proteins. Luciferase analyses showed that the area of 300 bp from the first exon was sufficient for PMA-responsiveness, and that specificity protein 1 (Sp1)- and two activator protein 2 (AP-2)-binding motifs within this area were necessary for responsiveness. Inhibitors for PKC and MEK1 decreased this PMA-induced promoter activity. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that Sp1 protein was originally bound to the Sp1 site and that two additional bands bound to the two AP-2 motifs were observed only when stimulated with PMA in MEG-O1 cells. The appearance of these bands resulted from binding to an unknown protein rather than AP-2. These results indicated that PMA up-regulates SPHK1 gene expression through PMA-responsive elements of the 5' promoter area of the gene, and suggested that PMA-mediated SPHK1 gene expression would be mediated via PKC- and ERK-dependent signal transduction pathway by binding the transcription factor to AP-2 motifs.",,"['Nakade, Yusuke', 'Banno, Yoshiko', 'T-Koizumi, Keiko', 'Hagiwara, Kazumi', 'Sobue, Sayaka', 'Koda, Masahiro', 'Suzuki, Motoshi', 'Kojima, Tetsuhito', 'Takagi, Akira', 'Asano, Haruhiko', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Murate, Takashi']","['Nakade Y', 'Banno Y', 'T-Koizumi K', 'Hagiwara K', 'Sobue S', 'Koda M', 'Suzuki M', 'Kojima T', 'Takagi A', 'Asano H', 'Nozawa Y', 'Murate T']","['Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, Higashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1388198103001720 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2003.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Dec 30;1635(2-3):104-16. doi: 10.1016/j.bbalip.2003.11.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify potential common primary targets of action of As(2)O(3) in myelogenic and lymphatic cell lines, we analyzed As(2)O(3) effects on caspases and on the mitochondrial membrane potential (Psi(M)) under uniform conditions. As(2)O(3) induced breakdown of Psi(M) and activated caspases in cell lines with different sensitivities for As(2)O(3), including cell lines resistant to mitoxantron or camptothecin but sensitive to As(2)O(3). Caspase inhibitors could not prevent breakdown of Psi(M) in lymphoid cell lines, whereas activation of caspases and apoptosis could be inhibited. Activation of caspases seems to be a downstream effect occurring after breakdown of Psi(M). We could show that all of these effects are independent of MDR-1 expression. There was no difference in the mode of action of As(2)O(3) in cell lines sensitive or resistant to camptothecin, mitoxantrone, or doxorubicin. As(2)O(3) deserves further evaluation as an adjunct or alternative to other cytostatic drugs.",,"['Rojewski, Markus T', 'Korper, Sixten', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Schrezenmeier, Hubert']","['Rojewski MT', 'Korper S', 'Thiel E', 'Schrezenmeier H']","['Freie Universitat Berlin, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie, Onkologie und Transfusionsmedizin, D-12203 Berlin, Germany. markus.rojewskI@medizin.uni-ulm..de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx034104+ [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2004 Jan;17(1):119-28. doi: 10.1021/tx034104+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although sublethal doses of inorganic arsenic are used, little is known about the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the high levels of arsenic in APL patients. To fill this important gap, this study describes the speciation of arsenic in urine from four APL patients treated with arsenic. Each patient was injected daily with an arsenite (As(III)) solution that contained 10 mg of As(2)O(3) precursor. Speciation analysis of the patient urine samples collected consecutively for 48 h, encompassing two intravenous injections of arsenic, revealed the presence of monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)). The intermediate methyl arsenic metabolites, MMA(III) and DMA(III), were detected in most urine samples from all of the patients when a preservative, diethyldithiocarbomate, was added to the urine samples to stabilize these trivalent arsenic species. The major arsenic species detected in the urine samples from the patients were As(III), MMA(V), and DMA(V), accounting for >95% of the total arsenic excreted. The relative proportions of As(III), As(V), MMA(V), and DMA(V) in urine samples collected 24 h after the injections of As(III) were 27.6 +/- 6.1, 2.8 +/- 2.0, 22.8 +/- 8.1, and 43.7 +/- 13.3%, respectively. The relatively lower fraction of the methylated arsenic species in these APL patients under arsenic treatment as compared with that from the general population exposed to much lower levels of arsenic suggests that the high levels of As(III) inhibit the methylation of arsenic (inhibits the formation of methyl arsenic metabolites). The arsenic species excreted into the urine accounted for 32-65% of the total arsenic injected. These results suggest that other pathways of excretion, such as through the bile, may play an important role in eliminating (removing) arsenic from the human body when challenged by high levels of As(III).",,"['Wang, Zhongwen', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Lu, Xiufen', 'Gong, Zhilong', 'Le, X Chris']","['Wang Z', 'Zhou J', 'Lu X', 'Gong Z', 'Le XC']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2G3, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (dimethylarsinous acid)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)', 'J37VJ5709S (monomethylarsonic acid)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic/urine', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Arsenites/urine', 'Cacodylic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/urine', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/urine', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxides/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine']",2004/01/20 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/01/20 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx0341714 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2004 Jan;17(1):95-103. doi: 10.1021/tx0341714.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP was expressed at higher levels in tumor tissuses compared to the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in a variety of human carcinomas. High expression of TP is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. To investigate the effect of TP on cisplatin-induced apoptosis, human leukemia Jurkat cells were transfected wild-type or mutant (L148R) TP cDNA. TP inhibits a number of steps in the cisplatin-induced apoptotic pathway, activation of caspase 3, 9 and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. These findings suggest a mechanism by which TP confers the resistance to apoptosis by cisplatin. Moreover, mutant TP that has no enzymatic activity also suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

For children with leukemia, the pain experienced after diagnosis has received scant attention. OBJECTIVE: To examine the pain experience, management strategies, and outcomes during the first year after the diagnosis of acute leukemia. METHODS: A longitudinal descriptive approach was used to collect data at seven data points from 95 English- and Spanish-speaking children, ages 4 to 17 years, receiving care in one of three southern California hospitals, and from their English- and Spanish-speaking parents. Age-appropriate instruments were used to examine the variables of pain intensity, location, pattern over time, and quality, as well as strategies for managing pain, perceived effectiveness of management strategies, and functional status. RESULTS: All the children reported pain over the course of the year. Pain intensity scores incorporated the full range of possible responses. For the children 4 to 7 years old, the highest and lowest mean scores, respectively, were 2 and 1.6 (scale, 0-4). For the children 8 to 17 years old, the highest and lowest mean scores, respectively, were 50.1 and 39.5 (scale, 0-100). The most common location of pain was the legs (26.5%) in all seven interviews. Other frequently noted sites were the abdomen (16.6%), head/neck (16.6%), and back (14.2%). The words used most frequently by the older English- and Spanish-speaking children to describe pain were ""uncomfortable"" (incomodo) and ""annoying"" (molesto). According to the interviews, the most frequently used strategy for pain management was stressor modification (e.g., medication, sleep, hot/cold, and massage). The most common coping strategies according to a Likert scale rating were ""watch TV"" (n = 426), ""lie down"" (n = 421), ""wish for it to go away"" (n = 417), and ""tell my mother or father"" (n = 416). The pain intensity scores after pain management were significantly lower for the younger children in three of the seven interviews and for the older children in all seven interviews.

In order to analyze the functional relevance of Bcl-X(S) in AML, Bcl-X(S) was moderately (2-3 fold) overexpressed in the AML cell lines HL-60 and MO7e by transfection with a tetracycline-regulatable Bcl-X(S) expression system.

Further analysis of this unexpected result revealed a compensatory transcriptional upregulation of endogenous anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) in MO7e and HL-60, and Bcl-2 in HL-60 cells resulting in increased protein levels. Bax levels were unchanged. Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 were found to heterodimerize with Bcl-X(S), thereby providing a possible explanation for the abrogation of its pro-apoptotic function.

The retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) gene is expressed from two distinct promoters, both of which have CpG islands. RARbeta1 is expressed primarily during embryogenesis, whereas RARbeta2 is expressed in adult tissues and hypermethylated in a number of cancer cells. We used combined bisulfite restriction analysis to evaluate their methylation in colorectal mucosa and tumors. Methylation of RARbeta1 was detected, with a mean of 2% in normal colon tissues in young subjects (< 32 years), and 16% in older subjects (> 75 years) (P < 0.001). Using paired normal/tumor tissue samples, we found higher mean methylation rate in tumors than in adjacent normal tissue (mean, 46% versus 16%; P < 0.001) and hypermethylation of RARbeta1 in all eight cell lines examined. By RT-PCR, RARbeta1 was not expressed in normal adult colon tissues and its expression could not be efficiently activated in most cell lines by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR). RARbeta2 methylation was also observed in normal colon tissues and was lower in young individuals than in older ones (mean, 11% versus 23%; P < 0.05). Among paired samples, RARbeta2 methylation was higher in tumor tissue than in normal tissue in 14 cases, vice versa in 7 cases, and equal in 6 cases. All eight cell lines were hypermethylated and did not express RARbeta2, but RARbeta2 expression could be reactivated easily by 5-Aza-CdR. We suggest that the embryonic RARbeta1 isoform is readily hypermethylated in aging colon mucosa and all colorectal cancers because of its lack of expression in normal tissues. The adult RARbeta2 isoform also shows age-related methylation in normal tissues but more variable methylation in colorectal cancer, perhaps because its expression offers continued protection against methylation or its silencing does not provide a selective advantage in the early stages of the disease.",,"['Youssef, Emile M', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Youssef EM', 'Estecio MR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. eyoussef@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics']",2004/01/17 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/01/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['591 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.3.1.591 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2004 Jan;3(1):82-6. doi: 10.4161/cbt.3.1.591.

These mutations include point mutations (single base pair insertions, deletions, or substitutions), gross chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions, insertions, amplifications, and translocations, and epigenetic changes. It seems likely that mutations affecting at least two pathways are required for the development of leukemia. One of these pathways regulates cell accumulation; the second regulates hematopoietic differentiation. Molecularly targeted therapy, which interrupts functions of the leukemogenic proteins generated by mutations, has been developed and shown to be effective for several forms of malignancy.

Most sporadic CRCs with MSI-H are known to be associated with the methylation of the hMLH1 promoter. Promoter methylation coincided with lack of hMLH1 expression. We aimed to investigate the association between MSI status, hMLH1 protein expression and methylation status of the hMLH1 promoter, and to determine the usefulness of each method in defining the MSI phenotype in sporadic CRCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CRCs from 173 patients from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) were assessed for their MSI status. An additional cohort of 18 MSI-H tumors from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) was included in the analysis of the MSI-H subgroup. MSI testing was performed by PCR using five standard MSI markers. hMLH1 promoter analysis was investigated by methylation specific PCR (MSP), and expression of the MMR genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Of the 173 CALGB tumors, 111 (64%) were MSS, 35 (20%) were MSI-L and 27 (16%) MSI-H, respectively. Data on hMLH1 protein expression, hMSH2 protein expression and hMLH1 methylation are available on 128, 173 and 81 of these tumors, respectively. Presence of hMLH1 and hMSH2 protein expression was significantly associated with MSI status. Four of 45 (8.9%) MSI-H tumors and 0 of 146 (0%) MSS/MSI-L tumors did not express hMSH2 (p = 0.0028). hMLH1 protein expression was present in 107 of 108 (99%) MSS and MSI-L tumors versus 11 of 20 (55%) MSI-H tumors (p < 0.0001). Of 61 MSS and MSI-L cancers studied for methylation, 11 (18%) were methylated at the hMLH1 promoter whereas 14 of 20 (70%) MSI-H cancers were methylated (p = 0.0001). In 27 MSI-H tumors studied for hMLH1 protein expression and methylation, 93% of tumors with loss of expression (93%) were also methylated while 42% (5/12) with positive immunostaining for hMLH1 were methylated at the hMLH1 promoter (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Promoter methylation and hMLH1 expression are significantly associated with the MSI-H phenotype in CRC. Promoter methylation analysis provides a useful means to screen for MSI-H tumors. Our data further suggests that hMLH1 promoter methylation analysis alone cannot replace MSI testing, as a significant number of MSI-H tumors could be potentially overseen by such an approach. We suggest that phenotypic evaluation of CRC is performed most reliably with MSI testing, although expression analysis and investigation of the promoter methylation status may complement the screening process.",,"['Arnold, Christian N', 'Goel, Ajay', 'Compton, Carolyn', 'Marcus, Victoria', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Dowell, Jeannette M', 'Wasserman, Linda', 'Inoue, Toru', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M', 'Boland, C Richard']","['Arnold CN', 'Goel A', 'Compton C', 'Marcus V', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Dowell JM', 'Wasserman L', 'Inoue T', 'Mayer RJ', 'Bertagnolli MM', 'Boland CR']","['Department of Medicine and Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics']",2004/01/17 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/01/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['590 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.3.1.590 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2004 Jan;3(1):73-8. doi: 10.4161/cbt.3.1.590.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The entire CEBPA coding region was sequenced in diagnostic samples from 236 AML patients 16 to 60 years of age with normal cytogenetics who were uniformly treated on two consecutive protocols of the AML Study Group Ulm, and CEBPA mutation status was correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: CEBPA mutations were detected in 36 (15%) of 236 patients. Twenty-one (9%) of 236 patients had mutations predicted to result in loss of C/EBP alpha function. Remission duration and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer for the 36 patients with CEBPA mutations (P =.01 and P =.05, respectively). On multivariate analysis, wild-type CEBPA was an independent prognostic marker affecting remission duration (hazard ratio, 2.85; P =.01) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.87; P =.04). Analysis of cooperating mutations (both types of activating FLT3 mutations and MLL partial tandem duplications) showed that FLT3 mutations had no significant prognostic influence in patients with CEBPA mutations. Furthermore, there was no significant overlap between the subgroup of patients with CEBPA mutation with predicted loss of C/EBP alpha function and patients with FLT3 or MLL mutations, suggesting that CEBPA loss-of-function mutations define a distinct biologic subclass of AML with normal cytogenetics.

In this regard, we show that sTRAIL serum levels as well as leukocyte-associated TRAIL significantly increase in melanoma patients following IFNalpha administration.

While recent evidence suggests that VEGF supports hematopoietic stem cell survival via an internal loop, the molecular mechanisms whereby autocrine stimulation of VEGFR-2 (KDR) promotes leukemia growth are not well understood. Here we show on acute myeloid primary leukemias and cell lines that VEGF/KDR autocrine loops operate both internally and externally. First, we demonstrate that KDR is constitutively phosphorylated and located at the nucleus of VEGF-producing leukemias. Treatment with anti-VEGF antibody, which acts externally, blocked KDR nuclear translocation and inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB; p65 and c-rel) activation. In contrast, a KDR-specific intracellular inhibitor failed to block KDR nuclear translocation, but inhibited the constitutive activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Erk and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways. Notably, treatment with the anti-VEGF antibody alone had little effect on cell survival, while the internal inhibitor induced leukemia apoptosis, and the 2 drugs produced synergistic effects, together and with chemotherapy, reducing cell survival to a larger extent than either agent alone.

Successful FLT3 inhibition can also improve survival in mouse models of FLT3-activated leukemia. CEP-701 is an orally available, novel, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits FLT3 autophosphorylation. We undertook a phase 1/2 trial to determine the in vivo hematologic effects of single-agent CEP-701 as salvage treatment for patients with refractory, relapsed, or poor-risk AML expressing FLT3-activating mutations. Fourteen heavily pretreated AML patients were treated with CEP-701 at an initial dose of 60 mg orally twice daily. CEP-701-related toxicities were minimal. Five patients had clinical evidence of biologic activity and measurable clinical response, including significant reductions in bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts. Laboratory data confirmed that clinical responses correlated with sustained FLT3 inhibition to CEP-701.

New treatments, which can induce complete remissions, allow patients with poor outlook to be treated while they are still asymptomatic. Whether or not the IgVH gene is mutated is the best predictor of clinical outcome, but this assay is unsuited to the routine laboratory. The gene coding for ZAP-70, a tyrosine kinase protein normally expressed in T and NK cells, has been shown by gene-expression profiling to be differentially expressed between patients with mutated and unmutated IgVH genes. We assessed whether ZAP-70 could be used as a prognostic marker in CLL. METHODS: We developed a flow cytometry assay for ZAP-70 protein expression and investigated its concordance with ZAP-70 mRNA expression, IgVH gene mutational status, and clinical outcome in 167 patients with CLL. FINDINGS: We showed high concordance between ZAP-70 protein expression and IgVH gene mutations. 108 patients (65%) had mutated IgVH genes and were ZAP-70 negative; 46 (28%) had unmutated IgVH genes and were ZAP-70 positive. Findings were discordant in 13 patients: six (4%) had mutated IgVH genes but were ZAP-70 positive, and seven (4%) had unmutated IgVH genes and were ZAP-70 negative. Expression of mRNA showed 97% concordance with ZAP-70 protein. Median survival was 24.4 years (95% CI 15.1-33.8) in ZAP-70 negative patients and 9.3 years (7.0-11.5) in those who were ZAP-70 positive (hazard ratio 5.5, 2.8-.8).

Therefore, we evaluated the antileukemic effect of the alkylating agent treosulfan in AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemosensitivity tests were performed in AML cell lines and primary cells from patients. Because protein kinase C (PKC) is known to play an integral role in the regulation of diverse cellular functions such as apoptosis, several PKC modulators were evaluated in conjunction with treosulfan. RESULTS: U937, THP-1, HL-60, TUR cells, and primary AML cells obtained from five consecutive patients displayed dose-dependent sensitivity to treosulfan. The LC(90) was approximately 100 microM, which is several fold below clinically achievable plasma levels. Cell death was associated with cellular events indicating apoptosis such as breakdown of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, proteolytic activation of caspase-3, or appearance of a sub-G(1) DNA peak. Synergistic antileukemic effects were observed in all cell lines and patient samples tested using the PKC activators bryostatin-1 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), whereas the PKC inhibitor GF109203X substantially reduced apoptosis. Furthermore, long-term preincubation with bryostatin-1 or TPA, both of which are known to down-regulate PKC protein levels, likewise inhibited treosulfan-induced apoptosis. Immunoblots revealed membrane translocation of PKC-delta, indicating activation of this enzyme upon treosulfan exposure. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for a strong antileukemic effect of treosulfan in both cell lines and AML blasts from patients at concentrations below the plasma levels described at standard dose levels.

We previously reported that ATRA increased serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels accompanied by thrombocytosis during ATRA therapy for APL. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of TPO gene by ATRA using human bone marrow stromal cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to quantify TPO mRNA and protein levels in cells from the human bone marrow stromal cell line KM101. Luciferase-based reporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were performed to identify a retinoic acid responsive element in the promoter region of TPO gene (TPO-RARE). RESULTS: TPO mRNA expression was up-regulated by approximately 2.9 times 8 hours after stimulation with 10(-6) M ATRA in KM101 cells. In contrast, ATRA did not alter TPO mRNA expression in cells from the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Protein level of KM101 cells also was increased with 10(-6) M ATRA for 48 hours in KM101 cells. We found the synthesized RARalpha protein bound to [gamma-32P]-labeled TPO-RARE probe and its binding was competed by adding 200x amount of cold TPO-RARE probe by EMSA. In addition, [gamma-32P]-labeled TPO-RARE probe bound to KM101 nuclear protein extract was supershifted by anti-RARalpha antibody and modified by treatment with ATRA. The relative luciferase activity of TPO gene was increased by 2.2x and the histone H4 was acetylated through TPO-RARE after ATRA stimulation in KM101 cells by ChIP assay. CONCLUSION: These data support the direct up-regulation of TPO transcription by ATRA stimulation in human bone marrow stromal cells and propose one of the mechanisms of thrombocytosis during ATRA therapy for APL.",,"['Kinjo, Kentaro', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Uchida, Hideo', 'Kitajima, Shigetaka', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Kinjo K', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Uchida H', 'Kitajima S', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects', 'Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/01/17 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2004/01/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03003503 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2003.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jan;32(1):45-51. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2003.10.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CFU-GM and BFU-E were cloned in vitro. Secondary colony formation by replated CFU-GM and subcolony formation by BFU-E provided measures of progenitor cell proliferation. Studies were performed in the presence of cytokine combinations with and without signal transduction inhibitors. RESULTS: Proliferation by CFU-GM and BFU-E was enhanced synergistically when common beta chain receptor cytokines (IL-3 or GM-CSF) were combined with G-CSF or EPO, but not with gp130 receptor cytokines (LIF or IL-6) or tyrosine kinase receptor cytokines (SCF, HGF, Flt-3 ligand, or PDGF). Delayed addition studies with G-CSF+IL-3 and EPO+IL-3 demonstrated that synergy required the presence of both cytokines from the initiation of the culture. The Jak2-specific inhibitor, AG490, abrogated the effect of combining IL-3 with EPO but had no effect on the enhanced CFU-GM proliferation stimulated by IL-3+G-CSF. The PI3 kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin substituted for G-CSF in combination with IL-3 since proliferation in the presence of LY294002/wortmannin+IL-3 was enhanced to the same extent as in the presence of G-CSF+IL-3. In contrast, LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited proliferation in the presence of EPO and in the presence of EPO+IL-3. CONCLUSION: 1) IL-3 may activate different signal transduction pathways when combined with G-CSF and when combined with EPO; 2) different signal transducing intermediates regulate erythroid and myeloid progenitor cell proliferation; and 3) inhibition of the PI3 kinase pathway suppresses myeloid progenitor cell differentiation and thereby increases proliferation.",,"['Lewis, John L', 'Marley, Stephen B', 'Ojo, Morenike', 'Gordon, Myrtle Y']","['Lewis JL', 'Marley SB', 'Ojo M', 'Gordon MY']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction']",2004/01/17 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2004/01/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03003175 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2003.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jan;32(1):36-44. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2003.09.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible to treatment if they were refractory or recurred after a prior response to fludarabine. Seventeen patients were treated. All patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days). Ten patients received rituximab in addition to chemotherapy. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 67 months. Nine of 17 patients had refractory disease. RESULTS: All patients had engraftment of donor cells. Eleven (65%) did not require platelet transfusions. Ten patients with persistent disease underwent immunomanipulation to augment GVL effects including immunosuppression withdrawal and donor lymphocyte infusion with or without rituximab treatment. Seven of these 10 patients had a complete response and 2 had a partial response; 8 of these 9 responders had received rituximab with their immunomanipulation process. The final response was complete remission in 12 and partial remission in 4 patients for an overall response rate of 94%. Overall survival was 100% for patients who received the combined chemo-rituximab conditioning regimen, vs 14% for those who received chemotherapy alone (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a pronounced GVL effect occurs after nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for advanced CLL. This activity might be facilitated by rituximab.

SCL is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is an essential regulator at several levels in the hematopoietic hierarchy and whose inappropriate regulation frequently contributes to the development of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This review discusses advances that have shed important light on the functions played by SCL during normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis and have revealed an unexpected robustness of hematopoietic stem cell function. Molecular studies have unraveled a mechanism through which gene expression is tightly controlled, as SCL functions within multifactorial complexes that exhibit an all-or-none switch-like behavior in transcription activation, arguing for a quantal process that depends on the concurrent occupation of target loci by all members of the complex. Finally, variations in composition of SCL-containing complexes may ensure flexibility and specificity in the regulation of lineage-specific programs of gene expression, thus providing the molecular basis through which SCL exerts its essential functions at several branch points of the hematopoietic hierarchy.",,"['Lecuyer, Eric', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Lecuyer E', 'Hoang T']","['Institut de Recherche en Immunovirologie et Cancerologie (IRIC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/01/17 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2004/01/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03003515 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2003.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jan;32(1):11-24. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2003.10.010.,,,,,,206,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the characterization of a new human member of the Ian family: hIan5. hIan5 is highly homologous to rIan4, has a predicted molecular weight of 35 kDa and contains distinct G motifs of GTP-binding proteins (G-1 to G-4) in the N-terminus. Human Ian5 is anchored to the mitochondria by the hydrophobic COOH-terminal domain. Human Ian5 is highly expressed in lymph node and spleen.

In a model of K562 cells with gradually increasing Pgp expression, a Pgp-dependent decline of intracellular imatinib levels was observed. Decreased imatinib levels were associated with a retained phosphorylation pattern of the Bcr-Abl target Crkl and loss of effect of imatinib on cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The modulation of Pgp by cyclosporin A (CSA) readily restored imatinib cytotoxicity in these cells.

In principle, this type of regulation could allow p53 gene transfer in both normal and tumor cells to produce detrimental effects only in the latter ones. Here, we report that primary bone marrow cells infected with a p53 recombinant retrovirus and transplanted into irradiated mice reconstitute the hematopoietic system, with no detectable alterations in any of its compartments.

These results show that exogenous p53 is controlled as tightly as the endogenous one, and opens the way to p53 gene therapy, without requiring tumor targeting.",,"['Bossi, Gianluca', 'Mazzaro, Giuseppina', 'Porrello, Alessandro', 'Crescenzi, Marco', 'Soddu, Silvia', 'Sacchi, Ada']","['Bossi G', 'Mazzaro G', 'Porrello A', 'Crescenzi M', 'Soddu S', 'Sacchi A']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Via delle Messi d'Oro 156, Rome 00158, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/genetics', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Organ Specificity', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*metabolism']",2004/01/16 05:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2004/01/16 05:00'],"['2004/01/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207042 [doi]', '1207042 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Jan 15;23(2):418-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207042.,,,['GP0234Y01/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a family in which 5 generations developed cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas. The originality of this report lies in the large number of generations developing the disease and the association with chronic myeloid leukemia. OBSERVATIONS: We have studied 16 members of a family with cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas spanning five generations. Eight members of the family (6 women and 2 men) presented with cutaneous leiomyomas. All 6 women also had uterine myomas with complications (menometrorrhagia, miscarriage, premature delivery and hysterectomy). Pathological association was also confirmed: polycythemia (1 case), papillary renal carcinoma (1 case) and chronic myeloid leukemia (1 case). DISCUSSION: Piloleiomyoma can develop sporadically or can be transmitted genetically. To our knowledge, we report the fifth case of a family of more than 2 generations presenting with piloleiomyoma. By studying the family tree, we were able to confirm the dominant autosomal nature of the mode of transmission found by other authors. The association of piloleiomyoma and uterine myoma is classified as Reed's syndrome. In such cases, the uterine myoma requires particularly careful monitoring since it is associated with significant risk of gynecological complications (menometrorrhagia, miscarriage, premature delivery and postpartum hemorrhage). Moreover, in our observations we describe diseases associated with piloleiomyoma: polycythemia (1 case), papillary renal carcinoma (1 case), but also the association of piloleiomyoma with chronic myeloid leukemia (1 case). A previous report described the same genetic deletion in uterine myoma as in chronic myeloid leukemia, which gives further weight to this association.",,"['Cairey-Remonnay, S', 'Salard, D', 'Algros, M-P', 'Laurent, R']","['Cairey-Remonnay S', 'Salard D', 'Algros MP', 'Laurent R']","['Service de Dermatologie 2, CHU Saint-Jacques, Besancon. scairey_remonnay@chu-besancon.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leiomyoma/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics']",2004/01/16 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2004/01/16 05:00'],"['2004/01/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AD-11-2003-130-11-0151-9638-101019-ART4 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2003 Nov;130(11):1017-20.,,,,,,,Leiomyomes cutanes multiples familiaux.,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous observations support the clinical utility of PKC inhibition by experimental sphingolipid derivatives such as safingol. The present studies document the cytotoxicity and chemomodulatory capacity of phenethylisothiocyanate derivatives of sphinganine and sphingosine (PEITC-Sa and PEITC-So) in the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. The biological actions of these novel derivatives were compared directly with those of the parent compounds sphinganine and sphingosine. Exposure to natural and modified sphingoid bases promoted extensive apoptotic cell death. The PEITC-sphingoid base derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxicity than their natural counterparts and were also distinctly superior to the clinically relevant sphingoid base analog safingol. In each instance, lethality was shown to correlate with inhibition of conventional and novel PKC isoforms and downstream loss of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/ERK2. The involvement of these signaling systems in potentiating the lethal actions of 1-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (araC) was also examined with regard to the differential actions of PEITC-Sa and PEITC-So to that of the parent compounds as well as safingol. Exposure to araC alone rapidly increased PKC activity. In the presence of PEITC-Sa or PEITC-So, the therapeutic efficacy of araC increased markedly; moreover, potentiation was directly related to the loss of araC-stimulated PKC activity. These findings demonstrate that PEITC-substituted sphingoid base analogs exert potent antineoplastic effects in human leukemia cells. We suggest that these synthetic lipids represent potentially useful agents in the development of conventional PKC/novel PKC-directed chemotherapeutic strategies.",,"['Johnson, Charlene R', 'Chun, Jiong', 'Bittman, Robert', 'Jarvis, W David']","['Johnson CR', 'Chun J', 'Bittman R', 'Jarvis WD']","['Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', ""0 (N-(N'-phenethylthiocarbamoyl)sphinganine)"", ""0 (N-(N'-phenethylthiocarbamoyl)sphingosine)"", 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thiourea/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2004/01/16 05:00,2004/06/23 05:00,['2004/01/16 05:00'],"['2004/01/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/jpet.103.060665 [doi]', 'jpet.103.060665 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2004 May;309(2):452-61. doi: 10.1124/jpet.103.060665.

METHODS: TPMT genotype was determined in an unrelated population of 250 Chinese healthy blood donors and 280 children with acute leukemia. TPMT genotyping assay was based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction digestion of PCR products, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct DNA sequencing in the TPMT * 2 (G238C), TPMT * 3A (G460A, A719G) and TPMT * 3C (A719G). RESULTS: There were 10 TPMT * 1/TPMT * 3C heterozygotes in 280 children. The frequency of the polymorphism was 3.6%. All the involved alleles were TPMT * 3C. Of the 160 children acute leukemia evaluated, 45 (26%) were intolerant to 6-MP. Presentations included hepatotoxicity and hematological toxicity. Six out of 45 children were heterozygous, while the other 39 were wild type homozygous. Before dosage adjustments for thiopurine, the hematologic toxicity and hepatotoxicity in TPMT heterozygous individuals occurred more frequently than in homozygous. Therefore, cases of TPMT heterozygotes experienced more missed doses of 6-MP. CONCLUSIONS: TPMT genotype is associated with tolerance in acute leukemia in children. The heterozygote individuals have low TPMT activity. Therefore the frequencies of hemtopoietic toxicity and hepatoxicity are high after using 6-MP. Detection of SNPs in the TPMT genes is useful in identifying children before administration of 6-MP.",,"['Ma, Xiao-li', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Wu, Min-yuan', 'Li, Zhi-gang', 'Hu, Ya-mei']","['Ma XL', 'Zhu P', 'Wu MY', 'Li ZG', 'Hu YM']","[""Hematology center Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital University of Medical sciences, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics']",2004/01/16 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/01/16 05:00'],"['2004/01/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2003 Dec;41(12):929-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, evidence showed that MDM2 might have a P53-independent role in tumorigenesis. MDM2 is over-expressed in human sarcoma and carcinoma. Recent studies showed that MDM2 might act as a transcriptional factor to modulate expressions of other genes involved in cell cycle regulation and transformation. In the present study, the investigators hypothesized that MDM2 directly affected NF-kappaB expression and function in a P53-independent manner. METHODS: MDM2 was transfected to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) line EU-4 cells lacking P53 expression and expressing very low levels of MDM2. MDM2 and P65 expression in mRNA level and protein level were detected by Western blot and Northern blot after transfection. Since the expression of E-selectin is P65 dependent, E-selectin promoter-CAT construct and P65 and MDM2 expression plasmids were co-transfected to EU-4 cells. CAT activation was determined with ELISA. The effect of adriamycin (ADM) at the concentrations of 15 micro g/ml, 7.5 micro g/ml, 5 micro g/ml and 1 micro g/ml on MDM2-transfected EU-4 cells and the parent cells was detected by MTT assay. RESULTS: The results showed that MDM2 up-regulated P65 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and MDM2 increased P65-mediated transactivation of E-selectin promoter. Without P65, MDM2 had no effect on the transactivation of E-selectin. Moreover, MDM2 antisense could not change the transactivation of E-selectin. MTT results showed that the survival rate of MDM2 transfected EU-4 cells was higher than that of parental cells. The results suggested that MDM2 transfection increase drug resistance of EU-4 cells to ADM compared with parent cells. CONCLUSION: (1) MDM2 up-regulated transcriptionally P65 expression. (2) MDM2 increased drug resistance of leukemia cells to ADM.

Using an MHC class I (Dd) transgenic mouse model, we generated bone marrow chimeras carrying mixtures of Dd-positive and -negative cells. NK reactivity against Dd-negative cells (missing self) was assayed by outgrowth of lymphoma cells, stability of the chimerism in vivo and killing of Concanavalin A blasts in vitro. Up to 20% Dd-negative haematopoietic cells reduced, but did not abrogate, rejection of Dd-negative tumours and killing of Dd-negative T-cell blasts. In contrast, the ratios between Dd-positive and -negative cells were stable in vivo, suggesting tolerance to normal cells.

However, prognostic value of type of chimeric mRNA bcr-xabl (b3a2 or b2a2) is still controversial. METHODS: We analyzed 97 cases of Philadelphia-positive CML to determine mRNA type by reverse-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and its relationship with clinical features. RESULTS: We detected b3a2 bcr-abl transcripts in 27 (28%) cases, b2a2 in 57 (59%) cases, and 13 (13%) with both mRNA transcripts b3a2/b2a2. These frequencies were the total reverse of other reports. Age, sex, hemoglobin, and white-cell counts showed no significant difference for those with either b3a2 or b2a2 bcr-abl transcripts. However, platelet counts of b3a2 patients were significantly higher than those of b2a2 patients (743.3 vs 477.3 x 109/L; p = 0.01).

DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational, non-randomized report of four consecutive cases. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four consecutive females (aged 9-17 years) affected by acute leukemia (3 acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 1 acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) and with hypoxemic ARF (defined by severe dyspnea at rest, respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, PaO2:FiO2 <200 and active contraction of the accessory muscles). Pressure support ventilation was delivered via a helmet (CaStar,Starmed, Italy) by means of an ICU ventilator (Servo 300, Siemens Elema, Sweden). RESULTS: We evaluated the effect of pressure support ventilation delivered by helmet on blood gases, respiratory rate, hemodynamics, patient tolerance, complication rate and outcome. An improvement of oxygenation was uniformly observed within the first 3 h after admission. The helmet was well tolerated by all children. No complication was observed. Two patients were discharged from the PICU in stable clinical conditions, whereas the remaining two children overcame the respiratory distress but had non-respiratory complications and eventually died. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive ventilation via the helmet can offer effective ventilatory support and improve gas exchange in the treatment of ARF in pediatric hematologic patients.

These domains have been observed to contain the PPXY, PTAP, or YXXL motifs. The deltaretroviruses, which include bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2, have a conserved PPPY motif in the C-terminal region of the matrix (MA) domain of Gag, while HTLV-1 also encodes a PTAP motif in MA. In this study, we analyzed the roles of the PPPY and PTAP motifs in the C terminus of MA in HTLV-1 particle release. Mutation of either motif (i.e., PPPY changed to APPY or PTAP changed to PTRP) reduced budding efficiencies. Particle buds and electron-dense regions of plasma membrane were observed by electron microscopy. When the locations of PPPY and PTAP were switched, particle release was eliminated. Intriguingly, the replacement of the PTAP motif with either the PPPY or YPDL motifs did not influence the release of virus particles, but the replacement of the PPPY motif with either PTAP or YPDL eliminated particle production. This indicates that the role that PPPY plays in HTLV-1 budding cannot be replaced with either PTAP or YPDL. A similar observation was made with the BLV PPPY motif. Finally, HTLV-1 particle release was found to be sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, implicating a role for ubiquitin in HTLV-1 budding. In summary, our observations indicate that (i) the PPPY motif plays a crucial role in virus budding and (ii) the PTAP motif plays a more subtle role in HTLV-1 particle release. Each of these motifs may play an important role in virus release from specific cell types and therefore be important in efficient virus spread and transmission.",,"['Wang, Huating', 'Machesky, Nicholas J', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Wang H', 'Machesky NJ', 'Mansky LM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Cellular and Developmental Biology Graduate Program, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Ubiquitin', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly']",2004/01/15 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2004/01/15 05:00'],"['2004/01/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.3.1503-1512.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Feb;78(3):1503-12. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.3.1503-1512.2004.,,PMC321366,"['R03 AI053155/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053155/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the assembled virion is released from the cell, Gag is cleaved at several sites by the viral protease (PR). The cleavages catalyzed by PR bring about a wide variety of physical changes in the particle, collectively termed maturation, and convert the particle into an infectious virion. In murine leukemia virus (MLV) maturation, Gag is cleaved at three sites, resulting in formation of the matrix (MA), p12, capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins. We introduced mutations into MLV that inhibited cleavage at individual sites in Gag. All mutants had lost the intensely staining ring characteristic of immature particles; thus, no single cleavage event is required for this feature of maturation. Mutant virions in which MA was not cleaved from p12 were still infectious, with a specific infectivity only approximately 10-fold below that of the wild type. Particles in which p12 and CA could not be separated from each other were noninfectious and lacked a well-delineated core despite the presence of dense material in their interiors. In both of these mutants, the dimeric viral RNA had undergone the stabilization normally associated with maturation, suggesting that this change may depend upon the separation of CA from NC.

However, tissue specificity is often associated with a reduction in viral titer. To overcome this problem, we constructed a series of murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral promoter conversion (ProCon) vectors carrying either the simian virus 40 poly(A) signal trimer (3pA) inserted in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) of these vectors or the human cytomegalovirus enhancer region (CMVe) inserted 5' and 3' of the retroviral LTRs. Furthermore, an extended AT stretch/attachment site (AT/att) of wild-type MLV was introduced into the vector. In the vector-producing cells, insertion of the CMVe and/or the 3pA resulted in a three- to fourfold-enhanced marker gene expression compared to the parental vector, whereas insertion of the AT/att gave a slight decrease in expression. The combination of all three modifications had no additional effects. In contrast, however, neomycin selection of infected cells revealed only a slight increase in virus titer with vectors carrying the 3pA modification; the titer was increased by 1 with vectors containing the extended AT/att, although the viral DNA copy numbers in infected cells were similar with both types of vectors. Thus, insufficient integration rather than insufficient reverse transcription and/or production of virus RNA is the major cause for the low titer obtained with the ProCon vectors. The combination of all three modifications resulted in a 2- to 3-log increase in the virus titer. These modifications result in expression targeted ProCon vectors with titers similar to those of nonmodified MLV-based vectors.",,"['Hlavaty, Juraj', 'Stracke, Anika', 'Klein, Dieter', 'Salmons, Brian', 'Gunzburg, Walter H', 'Renner, Matthias']","['Hlavaty J', 'Stracke A', 'Klein D', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Renner M']","['Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['24937-83-5 (Poly A)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Attachment Sites, Microbiological', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Poly A/genetics/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics']",2004/01/15 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2004/01/15 05:00'],"['2004/01/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.3.1384-1392.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Feb;78(3):1384-92. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.3.1384-1392.2004.,,PMC321378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have designed and tested a series of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-based vectors and vectors based on the oncogenic murine stem cell virus to deliver and express transgenes in human MSCs. These vectors were pseudotyped with either the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) glycoprotein (GP) or the feline endogenous virus RD114 envelope GP. Transduction efficiencies and transgene expression levels in MSCs were analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. While transduction efficiencies with virus particles pseudotyped with the VSV-G GP were found to be high, RD114 pseudotypes revealed transduction efficiencies that were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below those observed with VSV-G pseudotypes. However, chimeric RD114 GPs, with the transmembrane and extracellular domains fused to the cytoplasmic domain derived from the amphotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus 4070A GP, revealed about 15-fold higher titers relative to the unmodified RD114 GP. The transduction efficiencies in human MSCs of HIV-1-based vectors pseudotyped with the chimeric RD114 GP were similar to those obtained with HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the VSV-G GP.

The viral genome replicates in or close to ND10. In addition, the minor capsid protein, L2, accumulates in these subnuclear structures and recruits the major capsid protein, L1. We have now used cell lines deficient for promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, the main structural component of ND10, to study the role of this nuclear protein for L2 incorporation into virus-like particles (VLPs). L2 expressed in PML protein knockout (PML(-/-)) cells accumulated in nuclear dots, which resemble L2 aggregates forming at ND10 in PML protein-containing cells. These L2 assemblies also attracted L1 and the transcriptional repressor Daxx, suggesting that they are functional in the absence of PML protein. In addition, L2-containing VLPs assembled in PML(-/-) cells. In order to analyze whether incorporation of L2 into VLPs requires any specific subcellular localization, an L1 mutant defective for nuclear transport and L2 mutants deficient in nuclear translocation and/or ND10 localization were constructed. Using this approach, we identified two independent L2 domains interacting with L1. Mutant L2 proteins not accumulating in ND10 were incorporated into VLPs. Mutant L1 protein, which assembled into VLPs in the cytoplasm, did not incorporate L2 defective for nuclear translocation. The same mutant L2 protein, which passively diffuses into the nucleus, is incorporated into wild-type L1-VLPs in the nucleus.

We demonstrated by in vitro gel-shift assays that binding interactions of the human TATA box-binding protein (TBP) were disrupted on 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine monophosphate (CldAMP)-substituted TATA box consensus sequences. We hypothesized that human RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcriptional processes would therefore be affected by 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (CldATP) incorporation into a promoter TATA element. Double-stranded DNA templates containing the adenovirus major late promoter and coding sequences were enzymatically synthesized as control or with site-specific CldAMP residues, incubated with HeLa extract, and the synthesis of radiolabeled 44-base transcripts was assessed. With increasing amounts of HeLa extract, CldAMP substitution for dAMP within the TATA box decreased in vitro pol II transcription by approximately 35% compared with control substrates. Time-course studies showed that transcript production increased in a linear fashion on control substrates. In contrast, transcription on CldAMP-substituted TATA sequences reached a plateau after 20 min. Furthermore, CldAMP-substituted promoter sequences trapped or sequestered TBP, preventing its dissociation from DNA and subsequent binding to additional TATA elements to reinitiate transcription. CldAdo thus represents the first example of a nucleoside analog that acts as a transcriptional antagonist.

Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and gene expression by RT-PCR. RESULTS: As(2)S(2) could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of K562 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner at concentrations from 1 micromol/L to 5 micromol/L for 24 approximately 72 h. 34.4%, 21.8% and 46.0% of the treated-cells displayed apoptosis at 3 micro mol/L for 72 h, 5 micromol/L for 48 h and 5 micromol/L for 72 h, respectively.

Integrating new agents into the standard combined modality treatment paradigm is a daunting challenge. Gemcitabine has activity in advanced NSCLC and is a potent radiosensitizer, but preclinical trials did not delineate an optimal dose or schedule, and early attempts to graft full-dose gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2/week) onto standard radical thoracic radiation therapy (RT) were marked by significant grade 4 and 5 toxicity. More recent trials, however, have shown that attenuated doses of 150-300 mg/m2/week during radiation (XRT) are safer and potentially efficacious. Higher doses produce dose-limiting esophageal and pulmonary toxicities. Using a twice-weekly schedule, the maximum tolerated dose is 35 mg/m2. The use of 3 dimensional conformal RT may enable significant dose escalations while substantially reducing esophageal exposure and minimizing toxicity. The cooperative oncology groups are just beginning to evaluate gemcitabine in this setting. Cancer and Leukemia Group B, in a randomized phase II study, assessed combination gemcitabine and cisplatin in both the induction and radiosensitizing setting. During the induction phase, gemcitabine was given 1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 2 cycles in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, and then reduced to 600 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks during XRT. The overall response rate was 63% with median survival of 18.3 months and 1-year and 3-year survival rates of 68% and 28%, respectively. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group is currently spearheading a phase I study of concurrent radiation and weekly gemcitabine in combination with either weekly carboplatin or paclitaxel. Ongoing efforts will also evaluate the role of gemcitabine either alone or in combination with docetaxel in the consolidation setting after definitive chemoradiation has been completed. Whether gemcitabine in combination with radiation, with or without other agents, will ultimately prove superior to standard chemoradiation regimens remains to be determined.",,"['Langer, Corey J']",['Langer CJ'],"['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA. cj_langer@fccc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lung Cancer,Clinical lung cancer,100893225,,,,2004/01/15 05:00,2004/01/15 05:01,['2004/01/15 05:00'],"['2004/01/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:01 [medline]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-7304(11)70309-6 [pii]', '10.3816/clc.2003.s.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lung Cancer. 2003 Jan;4 Suppl 2:S45-9. doi: 10.3816/clc.2003.s.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells with apoptotic phenotype increased from 0.87% in controls to 9.40% in bleomycin-treated cells. Both the enzymes, caspase-3 and -8, were activated. Furthermore, the apoptotic phenotypes totally disappeared with zVAD-fmk, a caspase inhibitor. Besides, cytochrome c release from mitochondria happened simultaneously to apoptotic phenotypes, shrinkage of mitochondria but being independent of the mitochondrial permeability transition, since cyclosporine A and bongkrekic acid were inefficient on induced apoptosis. On the other hand, incubations with bleomycin (BLM) did not result in detectable changes in the expression of Bcl-2- and Bax-mRNA neither Bcl-2- or Bax-proteins. In conclusion, we suggest that BLM can produce apoptosis independently of p53 through three mechanisms: i) at the nuclear level by its endonuclease activities; ii) at the cell membrane, by activating caspases; and iii) at the mitochondria by releasing cytochrome c.

Eight of nine (88.9%) cell lines showed abnormal FHIT mRNA transcription, including 4 with co-existence of normal and aberrant transcripts, and 4 with absence of mRNA expression. Abnormal FHIT mRNA expression was noted in 10 (32.3%) DLBCL patients, including 3 with loss of FHIT mRNA expression and 7 with aberrant transcripts. In all NHLs, abnormal FHIT transcripts were determined for 17 of 62 patients (27.4%). Regarding the FHIT protein expression in DLBCLs, 41.9% showed strong FHIT IHC expression (2+), where 58.1% patients revealed reduced (1+) or absence (0) of FHIT protein. Decreased FHIT protein expression was associated with a worse survival after univariate and multivariate analysis. Our result indicates that abnormal FHIT mRNA expression is noted frequently in NHL cell lines and a certain proportion of NHL patients, and decreased FHIT protein expression indicates a significantly worse prognosis in DLBCLs.",,"['Chen, Po-Min', 'Yang, Muh-Hwa', 'Hsiao, Liang-Tsai', 'Yu, I-Ting', 'Chu, Chiau-Jun', 'Chao, Ta-Chung', 'Yen, Chueh-Chuan', 'Wang, Wei-Shu', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Liu, Jin-Hwang']","['Chen PM', 'Yang MH', 'Hsiao LT', 'Yu IT', 'Chu CJ', 'Chao TC', 'Yen CC', 'Wang WS', 'Chiou TJ', 'Liu JH']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201 Shih-Pai Road, Section 2, Taipei 112, Taiwan, R.O.C. pmchen@vghtpe.gov.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/01/14 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/01/14 05:00'],"['2004/01/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2004 Feb;11(2):349-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In t(12;13)(p13;q12) AML, ectopic expression of the homeobox gene CDX2 was detected in addition to expression of the ETV6-CDX2 fusion gene, generated by the chromosomal translocation. Here we show in a murine model of t(12;13)(p13;q12) AML that myeloid leukemogenesis is induced by the ectopic expression of CDX2 and not by the ETV6-CDX2 chimeric gene. Mice transplanted with bone marrow cells retrovirally engineered to express Cdx2 rapidly succumbed to fatal and transplantable AML. The transforming capacity of Cdx2 depended on an intact homeodomain and the N-terminal transactivation domain. Transplantation of bone marrow cells expressing ETV6-CDX2 failed to induce leukemia. Furthermore, coexpression of ETV6-CDX2 and Cdx2 in bone marrow cells did not accelerate the course of disease in transplanted mice compared to Cdx2 alone. These data demonstrate that activation of a protooncogene by a balanced chromosomal translocation can be the pivotal leukemogenic event in AML, characterized by the expression of a leukemia-specific fusion gene.

The main human health concern associated with benzene exposure is acute myelogenous leukemia. Benzene produces lung tumors in mice, while its effects on human lung are not clear. The adverse effects of benzene are dependent on its metabolism by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. The isozymes CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 play roles in the metabolism of benzene at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. Previous studies indicate that the mouse lung readily metabolizes benzene and that CYP2F2 plays a role in this biotransformation. The significance of CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 in benzene metabolism was determined by measuring their apparent kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max). Use of wild-type and CYP2E1 knockout mice and selective inhibitors allowed the determination of the individual importance of both CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 in mouse liver and lung. A simple Michaelis-Menten relationship involving Lineweaver-Burk plots for the microsomal metabolism of benzene shows the apparent kinetic factors are different between the wild-type (K(m): 30.4 microM, V(max): 25.3 pmol/mg protein/min) and knockout (K(m): 1.9 microM, V(max): 0.5 pmol/mg protein/min) mouse livers. Wild-type lung has a K(m) of 2.3 microM and V(max) of 0.9 pmol/mg protein/min. CYP2E1 knockout lung has similar affinity and metabolic activity with a K(m) of 3.7 microM and V(max) of 1.2 pmol/mg protein/min. These data suggest CYP2E1 is less important in the lung than liver, and that it has a lower affinity for benzene but higher rate of hydroxylated metabolite production than does CYP2F2, which plays the predominant role in metabolizing benzene in mouse lung.",,"['Sheets, Patrick', 'Carlson, Gary']","['Sheets P', 'Carlson G']","['School of Health Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

In a previous study we demonstrated that PCL plasma cells display a high expression of CD27, in contrast to MM plasma cells. The present study was set out to assess the functional properties of CD27 expressed on PCL plasma cells by triggering with its ligand CD70. Using CD27-expressing purified plasma cells from a PCL patient we demonstrated that CD27-triggering modestly inhibited spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. In vitro stimulation and Western blotting showed that activation of p38 and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) was associated with CD27-mediated signal transduction. Specific inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK abolished the anti-apoptotic effects of CD27-triggering. Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 strongly sensitized PCL cells for dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Finally, in dexamethasone-treated PCL cells, CD27-triggering was associated with persistent DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) but not of nuclear factor-kappaB. These findings suggest that, in primary PCL, specific anti-apoptotic pathways exist that might provide novel therapeutic targets.",,"['Guikema, Jeroen E J', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Abdulahad, Wayel H', 'Hovenga, Sjoerd', 'Bos, Nicolaas A']","['Guikema JE', 'Vellenga E', 'Abdulahad WH', 'Hovenga S', 'Bos NA']","['Department of Cell Biology, Section Histology and Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Groningen, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, 9713 AV Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (U 0126)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*immunology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*immunology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2004/01/14 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2004/01/14 05:00'],"['2004/01/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['4783 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04783.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Feb;124(3):299-308. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04783.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its effects on solid tumours, including breast cancer, are unknown. This report concerns the effect of IL-7 on the growth of breast cancer cells. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunoprecipitation were used to detect to detect IL-7 and its receptor (IL-7R) in breast cancer cell lines MDA MB-231 and MCF-7. These cells were treated with various concentrations of human recombinant IL-7 over specified intervals. Changes in growth were assessed using colorimetric and fluorescence-based technologies. Selective IL-7 downstream signalling inhibitors (wortmannin, JAK-3 inhibitor 1, piceatanol and AG 490) were use to clarify the pathways through which IL-7 may affect breast cancer growth. RESULTS: IL-7 significantly accelerated the growth of MDA MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells (P = 0.004 and P = 0.012, respectively, in PicoGreenassay). The maximum effects were observed after incubation for 72 h. The stimulatory effect of IL-7 on cell growth was completely eliminated in the presence of wortmannin (P = 0.001 and P = 0.003 versus no inhibitor in MDA MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively) and JAK-3 inhibitor 1 (P < 0.001 versus no inhibitor in both cell lines), but not in the presence of piceatanol and AG 490.

METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had biopsy-proven T-cell lymphoma or leukemia and failure to respond to previous therapy or an expected complete response rate to conventional therapy of < 20%. Pentostatin was administered at an initial dose of 3.75 or 5.0 mg/m(2) by intravenous bolus daily over a consecutive 3-day period every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-two of 44 patients enrolled in the study were evaluable. The median age of the patients was 62 years (range, 38-86 years). Patients received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 0-10 previous therapies). Of these patients, 32 (76%) had mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and 10 patients (24%) had other T-cell leukemias or lymphomas. The overall response rate was 54.8% (complete remission, 6 patients [14.3%]; partial remission, 17 patients [40.5%]). Durable responses were observed mainly in patients with Sezary syndrome or peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 20 months (range, 1-83+ months). The median duration of response was 4.3 months (range, 1-61 months). The most common toxicities were neutropenia, nausea, and CD4 suppression.

Here, we address the signaling pathways utilized by ASC to trigger apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia T cells. We show that ASC (0.5-20 microM) induces a mitochondrial pathway that requires the activation of the initiator caspase-2 upstream of mitochondria. ASC-triggered apoptosis occurred independent of CD95, but required mitochondrial dysfunction. The activation of caspase-2 was shown to precede the processing of caspase-8, -9 and -3. The specific caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVADfmk abrogated ASC-induced DNA fragmentation almost completely. Overexpression of Bcl-x(L) blocked caspase-8 but not caspase-2 processing. Conversely, caspase-2 inhibition strongly reduced caspase-9 activation. As a possible link between caspase-2 and mitochondrial dysfunction, Bid was found to be cleaved by ASC. In addition, JNK was activated by ASC upstream of mitochondria via reactive oxygen species. The specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 partially inhibited caspase-2 and -9 processing as well as cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation indicating that JNK contributes to, but is not necessary for ASC-mediated apoptosis. Thus, ASC triggers a pathway in which early activation of caspase-2 provides a possible link between its DNA-damaging activity and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction.

The mitochondrial Bcl-2 protein inhibits apoptosis and is therefore an important mediator of resistance to treatment with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy. Oblimersen (Genasense, Aventis Pharmaceuticals / Genta Inc) is a 18mer antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO), which specifically binds to the first 6 codons of the human bcl-2 mRNA, resulting in degradation and destruction of the mRNA by RNAse H. Subsequently there is a significant decrease of bcl-2 translation. A growing number of preclinical and clinical studies suggests that the combination of cytotoxic therapy with Oblimersen results in synergistic anticancer efficacy in many hematologic and solid tumors. Due to its low toxicity profile, oblimersen is an ideal combination partner with conventional chemotherapy. Three randomized phase-III trials (malignant melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma) have recently finished recruitment. The results of these studies will be available by the end of 2003. Based on preclinical data, a lot of nonrandomized phase-II studies on several different tumor types like AML, CML, NHL, prostate cancer and breast cancer are underway.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 260 cases of AML diagnosed at our institution between 1998 and 2000. Diagnosis was based on peripheral blood and bone marrow examination for morphology cytochemistry and immunophenotypic studies. SPSS software package, version 10, was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of our cases were adults. The age of the patients ranged from one year to 78 years with a median age of 27.2 years. There were 187 males and 73 females. The commonest FAB subtype, in both children and adults, was AML-M2. The highest WBC counts were seen in AML-M1 and the lowest in AML-M3 (10-97 x 10(9)/L, mean 53.8 x 10(9)/L). The mean values and range for hemoglobin was 6.8 gm/l (1.8 gm/l to 9.2 gm/l), platelet count 63.3 x 10(9)/L (32-83 x 10(9)/L), peripheral blood blasts 41.4% (5 to 77%) and bone marrow blasts 57.6% (34-96%). Myeloperoxidase positivity was highest in the M1, M2 and M3 subtypes. CD13 and CD33 were the most useful markers in the diagnosis of AML. CD14 and CD36 were most often seen in monocytic (38%) and myelomonocytic (44%) leukemias. Lymphoid antigen expression was seen in 15% of cases. CD7 expression was the commonest (11%).

In various types of leukemias, primary investigation by conventional cytogenetic [CC] technique followed by FISH has increased our understanding of the abnormal clonal formation involving different gene region. AIMS: Present study is aimed to use different kinds of in-house FISH probes in various hematological malignancies and its correlation with conventional cytogenetic finding. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cytogenetic study was carried out in 360 patients either from peripheral blood or from bone marrow cells suspected for various types of leukemias. Four of 360 cases were further selected for FISH study by using different types of in-house probes, such as BAC [Bacterial Artificial Chromosome], PAC [Phague Artificial Chromosome], alphoid, PCP [Partial Chromosome Paint] and WCP [Whole Chromosome paint]. RESULTS: The results confirmed breakpoints of inversion 16 and del 16 in case 2 and 3 respectively. Whereas, case 1 did not confirm the cytogenetic findings of t(15;17) by PML/RARa fusion signals as multiple cell lines were involved in the patients. PCP and WCP were helpful in the identification of the marker chromosome in case 1. Telomeric and centromeric probes confirmed the cytogenetic findings of t(5;7) in case 4. CONCLUSION: We observe from this study that, in addition to the conventional cytogenetic study, FISH study provide further confirmation of chromosomal rearrangements. This facilitates our understanding of the neoplastic process more precisely for the better prognostication of the patient.",,"['Frenny, V J', 'Antonella, Z', 'Luisa, A', 'Shah, A D', 'Sheth, J J', 'Rocchi, M']","['Frenny VJ', 'Antonella Z', 'Luisa A', 'Shah AD', 'Sheth JJ', 'Rocchi M']","['FRIGE, Genetic Centre, 20/1, Bima Nagar, Satellite, Ahmedabad-380 015, India. jshethad1@sancharnet.in']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Probes', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/01/13 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/01/13 05:00'],"['2004/01/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2003 Oct-Dec;40(4):135-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer between RNA strands during DNA synthesis is governed by both sequence similarity between templates and structural features of the dimeric RNA. A kissing hairpin, believed to facilitate intermolecular recognition and dimer formation, was previously found to be a preferred site for recombination. To investigate if hairpin loop-loop-complementarity is the primary determinant for this recombination preference, we have devised a novel 5' leader recombination assay based upon co-packaging of two wild-type or loop-modified murine leukemia virus vector RNAs. We found that insertion of an alternative palindromic loop in one of the two vectors disrupted site-directed template switching, whereas site-specificity was restored between vectors with complementary non-wild-type palindromes. By pairing vector RNAs that contained identical non-palindromic loop motifs and that were unlikely to interact by loop-loop kissing, we found no preference for recombination at the kissing hairpin site. Of vector pairs designed to interact through base pairing of non-palindromic loop motifs, we could in one case restore hairpin-directed template switching, in spite of the reduced sequence identity, whereas another pair failed to support hairpin- directed recombination. However, analyses of in vitro RNA dimerization of all studied vector combinations showed a good correlation between efficient dimer formation between loop-modified viral RNAs and in vivo cDNA transfer at the kissing hairpin. Our findings demonstrate that complementarity between wild-type or non-wild-type hairpin kissing loops is essential but not sufficient for site-specific 5' leader recombination and lend further support to the hypothesis that a specific 'kissing' loop-loop interaction is guided by complementary sequences and maintained within the mature dimeric RNA of retroviruses.",,"['Mikkelsen, Jacob Giehm', 'Rasmussen, Soren Vestergaard', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Mikkelsen JG', 'Rasmussen SV', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', '*Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Virus Assembly']",2004/01/13 05:00,2004/01/22 05:00,['2004/01/13 05:00'],"['2004/01/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/nar/gkh159 [doi]', '32/1/102 [pii]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan 9;32(1):102-14. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkh159.

These functions rely on different TAL1 structural domains that are responsible for dimerization, transactivation, and DNA binding. Previous work, most often done in mice, has shown that some TAL1 functions do not require DNA binding. To study the role of TAL1 and the relevance of the TAL1 DNA-binding domain in human erythropoiesis, we developed an approach that allows an efficient enforced wild-type or mutant TAL1 protein expression in human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells using a lentiviral vector. Differentiation capacities of the transduced cells were studied in a culture system that distinguishes early and late erythroid development. Results indicate that enforced TAL1 expression enhances long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) potential and erythroid differentiation of human CD34(+) cells as shown by increased beta globin and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) gene expressions and erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-Es), erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-Es), and glycophorin A-positive (GPA(+)) cell productions. Enforced expression of a TAL1 protein deleted of its DNA-binding domain (named Delta bTAL1) mimicked most TAL1 effects except for the LTC-IC enhancement, the down-regulation of the CD34 surface marker, and the GPA(+) cell production.

The effect of imatinib on PDC generation was related to up-regulation of Flt3 on leukemic CD34+ progenitors. Moreover, patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who were in complete cytogenetic or molecular response after imatinib treatment restored their blood PDCs both quantitatively and functionally comparable to healthy donors, in contrast to patients not responding to imatinib, further confirming that disease response to imatinib is accompanied by restoration of PDC function in vivo.

Here, we examined expression of the LTB(4) omega-hydroxylating activity during the differentiation of HL60 cells, an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, in the presence of various inducers. Among the inducers used, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) most strongly induces the LTB(4) omega-hydroxylating activity in a dose-dependent manner. The time course of the induction of the omega-hydroxylating activity correlates well with that of the superoxide-generating activity, indicative of cell differentiation. ATRA-treated cell microsomes convert LTB(4) to its 20-hydroxyl derivative under aerobic conditions in the present of NADPH. The reaction is inhibited by carbon monoxide, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450, and by antibodies raised against NADPH-P-450 reductase. CYP4F3A appears to be responsible for the LTB(4) omega-hydroxylase activity, based on the following observations: expression of the mRNA for CYP4F3A is observed together with the induction of LTB(4) omega-hydroxylating activity in ATRA-treated HL60 cells; and the apparent K(m) values for the omega-hydroxylation of LTB(4) and lipoxin B(4) by ATRA-treated cell microsomes are essentially the same as those of CYP4F3A in human neutrophil microsomes.",,"['Mizukami, Yoichi', 'Sumimoto, Hideki', 'Takeshige, Koichiro']","['Mizukami Y', 'Sumimoto H', 'Takeshige K']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. mizukami@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytochromes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 4)', 'EC 1.14.14.94 (CYP4F3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.94 (leukotriene B4 20-hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/classification/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 4', 'Cytochromes/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/classification/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2004/01/13 05:00,2004/04/20 05:00,['2004/01/13 05:00'],"['2004/01/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03026330 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.12.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Jan 30;314(1):104-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.12.062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Mar 19;315(4):1166'],,,,

As no structures are available for these proteins we have constructed molecular models based on distant sequence similarity to other retroviral capsid proteins. RESULTS: Molecular models were constructed for the amino terminal domains of the probable capsid-like structure for the mouse Fv1 gene product and the capsid protein of the MLV. The models were based on sequence alignments with a variety of other retrovirus capsid proteins. As the sequence similarity of these proteins with MLV and especially Fv1 is very distant, a threading method was employed that incorporates predicted secondary structure and multiple sequence information. The resulting models were compared with equivalent models constructed using the sequences of the capsid proteins of known structure. CONCLUSIONS: These comparisons suggested that the MLV model should be accurate in the core but with significant uncertainty in the loop regions.

METHODS: The aim of this study was to analyze various methods for transfection of primary leukemia cells and leukemia cell lines and to improve the efficiency of gene delivery. Here, we evaluated a novel electroporation based technique called nucleofection. This novel technique uses a combination of special electrical parameters and specific solutions to deliver the DNA directly to the cell nucleus under mild conditions. RESULTS: Using this technique for gene transfer up to 75% of primary cells derived from three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and K562 cells were transfected with the green flourescent protein (GFP) reporter gene with low cytotoxicity. In addition, 49(+/- 9.7%) of HL60 leukemia cells showed expression of GFP.

The endometrium in IVF cycles is thus subject to an altered endocrinological environment and to a possible direct effect of the ovarian stimulation therapy. Factors influencing the endometrial receptivity in such cycles are poorly understood. Studies comparing the endometrium in IVF cycles with natural cycles as controls have shown premature secretory changes in the post-ovulatory and early luteal phase of IVF cycles, followed by a large proportion of dyssynchronous glandular and stromal differentiation in the mid-luteal phase. These findings suggest a profound modification of luteal endometrial development in stimulated cycles. This hypothesis is further supported by the demonstration of a modified endometrial steroid receptor regulation and a profound antiproliferative effect in IVF cycles. The time of maximal endometrial receptivity is defined as the implantation window and is characterized by the expression of various endometrial products, among which pinopodes, integrins and leukaemia inhibitory factor are best described. Premature expression of pinopodes and integrins are in line with the observation of precocious luteal transformation following ovarian stimulation, although the clinical relevance with respect to the establishment of a clinical pregnancy awaits further validation. Studies exploring the endometrium within the cycle of embryo transfer have shown a deleterious effect of severe peri-ovulatory maturation advancement exceeding 3 days, as no clinical pregnancies were obtained in this condition.

RESULTS: When surrogate markers are used, such as the plasma concentration of angiogenic growth factors or the density of blood vessels within the bone marrow, angiogenesis is associated with poor prognosis and treatment outcome in haematopoietic malignancy. While human treatment data are scarce, findings in animal experiments suggest that anti-angiogenesis might retard leukemogenesis.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the drug efflux pump that mediates this resistance, can be inhibited by compounds with a variety of pharmacological functions, thus circumventing the MDR phenotype. The present study was performed to evaluate a unique MDR-reversal feature of a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid tetrandrine (TET) in a P-gp expressing MOLT-4 MDR line (MOLT-4/DNR) established in our laboratory. Cell viability was determined by an MTT assay. P-gp function was characterized by determining the Rh123 accumulation/efflux capacity. P-gp overexpression in resistant MOLT-4/DNR cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis after staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody 17F9. Compared to ciclosporin A (CsA), TET exhibited stronger activity to reverse drug resistance to daunorubicin (DNR), vinblastine (VLB) and doxorubicin (DOX) in MOLT-4/DNR cells. TET showed no cytotoxic effects on parental MOLT-4 cells lacking P-gp expression or on the resistant MOLT-4/DNR cells. TET modulated DNR cytotoxicity even after it was washed with the medium for 24 h, while CsA almost completely lost its reversal capability 24 h after washing. TET and CsA similarly increased the accumulation of Rh123 in resistant MOLT-4/DNR cells. However, TET inhibited Rh123 efflux from resistant cells even after washing with the medium, while CsA rapidly lost its ability to inhibit Rh123 efflux after washing. The current study suggests that TET enhances the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs in the P-gp expressing MDR cell line by modulating P-gp in a different manner to the well-known P-gp inhibitor CsA.",,"['Liu, Zhen-Li', 'Hirano, Toshihiko', 'Tanaka, Sachiko', 'Onda, Kenji', 'Oka, Kitaro']","['Liu ZL', 'Hirano T', 'Tanaka S', 'Onda K', 'Oka K']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/01/10 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2004/01/10 05:00'],"['2004/01/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1211/0022357022115 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2003 Nov;55(11):1531-7. doi: 10.1211/0022357022115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many ailments that were once considered a single entity have been classified into finer categories on the basis of response to therapy (e.g. type I and type II diabetes), inheritance (e.g. familial and non-familial polyposis coli), histology (e.g. small cell and adenocarcinoma of lung) and most recently transcriptional profiling (e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma). The next dimension in this finer categorization appears to be the typing of the patient rather than the disease i.e. disease X in person of type Y. The problem of personalized medicine is to devise tests which predict the type of individual, especially where the type is correlated with response to therapy. Immunology has been at the forefront of personalized medicine for quite a while, even though the term is not often used in this connection. Blood grouping and cross-matching (for blood transfusion), and anaphylaxis test (for penicillin) are just two examples. In this paper I will argue that immunological tests have an important place in the future of personalized medicine. I will describe methods we developed for personalizing vaccines based on MHC allele frequencies in human populations and methods for predicting peptide binding to class I MHC molecules. In conclusion, I will argue that immunological tests, and consequently immunoinformatics, will play a big role in making personalized medicine a reality.",,"['Gulukota, Kamalakar']",['Gulukota K'],"['grk bioSciences Private Limited, #210, My Home Tycoon, 6-3-1192, Begumpet, Hyderabad 500 016, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Novartis Found Symp,Novartis Foundation symposium,9807767,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Allergy and Immunology', '*Computational Biology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Vaccines, Subunit/isolation & purification/therapeutic use']",2004/01/10 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2004/01/10 05:00'],"['2004/01/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/0470090766.ch4 [doi]'],ppublish,"Novartis Found Symp. 2003;254:43-50; discussion 50-6, 98-101, 250-2. doi: 10.1002/0470090766.ch4.",,,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,,

Some cases, however, progress to an aggressive disease after the indolent clinical stage. The transformation mechanism into a high-grade malignancy has not been well studied. We have established 2 leukemia cell lines, MOTN-1 and PLT-2, derived from the same clone of CD56+ T-LGL leukemia in chronic and aggressive phases, respectively. The paired availability of such cell lines is valuable in biologic and genetic investigation of T-LGL leukemia. We used a microarray containing 406 cDNAs to elucidate alterations of gene expression between the 2 cell lines. We found a number of genes that were differentially expressed: 13 genes with increased expression and 3 genes with reduced expression in PLT-2 cells as compared to MOTN-1 cells. Increased expression of the dek, rac, Op18, CD6, CD58, CD106, Id2, ATF4, IRF5, ELL2 and D6 genes, and reduced expression of the GzmA and GzmK genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, whose results paralleled the microarray data. These upregulated genes encode oncoproteins, cell surface antigens including molecules related to T cell proliferation, transcription factors, and a chemokine receptor. The two downregulated genes encode granzymes that play an important role for induction of cell death. These findings suggest that there is differential gene expression in different clinical phases of T-LGL leukemia and these differentially expressed genes would be potential targets for further studies to identify the genes involved in the transformation process of T-LGL leukemia.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Daibata, Masanori', 'Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'Machida, Hisanori', 'Taguchi, Takahiro', 'Ohtsuki, Yuji', 'Taguchi, Hirokuni']","['Daibata M', 'Matsuo Y', 'Machida H', 'Taguchi T', 'Ohtsuki Y', 'Taguchi H']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. daibatam@kochi-ms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['CD56 Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/01/09 05:00,2004/02/20 05:00,['2004/01/09 05:00'],"['2004/01/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11647 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Mar 1;108(6):845-51. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, expression of VEGF and its receptors has been found on leukemic cells as well as on endothelial cells. VEGF may fulfill a fundamental role in promoting tumor angiogenesis and proliferation by stimulating both endothelial cells and leukemic cells. To investigate the role of VEGF in the angiogenesis and growth of leukemic cell, we used an antisense strategy to downregulate VEGF expression in K562 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line. Expression of antisense-VEGF in K562 cells reduced the secretion of VEGF protein and inhibited cell survival. The proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were decreased in response to the conditioned medium (CM) from K562 cells expressed antisense-VEGF, compared to CM from K562 cells transfected with vector control. Moreover, subcutaneous injection of nude mice with antisense-VEGF K562 cells inhibited tumor growth with a reduction of the density of microvessels and an increased apoptosis in those tumors, compared to vector control K562 cells.

Here, we describe the establishment and phenotypic characterization of U937 cells in which P210 BCR/ABL can be conditionally expressed using tetracycline. The induction of BCR/ABL in the obtained clones resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of the STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 molecules, consistent with the findings in other model systems. Phenotypic characterization of the clones revealed that BCR/ABL induces a slight decrease in the proliferation and viability, without a marked effect on cell cycle distribution, the rate of apoptosis or on cellular differentiation, as judged by several cell surface markers and capacity to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium. Interestingly, BCR/ABL was found to upregulate the expression of carcinoembryonic-related antigen (CEA)CAM1 (CD66a), which is a plasma membrane-linked glycoprotein belonging to the CEAs and involved in signal transduction and cellular adhesion. The expression of CEACAM1 was reversible upon imatinib treatment in BCR/ABL-expressing U937 cells as well as in BCR/ABL-positive K562 cells.

Compared to 425 children aged over 1 year with common/preB (c/preB) ALL, the 44 infants were highly resistant to steroids (for prednisolone (PRED) more than 580-fold, P=0.001) and L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (12-fold, P=0.001), but more sensitive to cytarabine (AraC) (1.9-fold, P=0.001) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) (1.7-fold, P<0.001).

ProB ALL of all ages had a profile similar to infant ALL when compared with the group of c/preB ALL: relatively more resistant to L-ASP and PRED (and in addition thiopurines), and more sensitive to AraC and 2-CdA. Age was not related to cellular drug resistance within the proB ALL group (<1 year, n=32, vs >/=1 year, n=19), nor within the MLL-rearranged ALL (<1 year, n=34, vs >/=1 year, n=8).

The expression of P-glycoprotein, multidrug-resistance protein, and lung-resistance protein (LRP) was not higher in infants compared to older c/preB ALL patients, but LRP was higher in proB ALL and MLL-rearranged ALL of all ages.

Imatinib sensitizes the WSU and I83 human CLL cell lines, 10- and two-fold, respectively, to CLB. Furthermore, in primary cultures of malignant B-lymphocytes obtained from 12 patients with CLL (seven patients were untreated and five treated with CLB), imatinib synergistically sensitized these lymphocytes from two- to 20-fold to CLB. This synergistic effect was observed at concentrations of imatinib (</=10 microM), which are achievable in patients with minimal toxicity. Moreover, the combination of both drugs results in increased apoptosis in CLL cell lines. These results suggest that imatinib should be useful in improving the therapeutic index of CLB in CLL. The mechanism of action appears to involve imatinib inhibition of c-abl kinase activity with an associated decrease in CLB-induced Rad51 phosphorylation and CLB-induced Rad51 nuclear foci, suggesting that imatinib decreases Rad51-related DNA repair of CLB-induced DNA lesions. Altogether, our results suggest that imatinib is a promising adjuvant therapy to CLB treatment of CLL.",,"['Aloyz, R', 'Grzywacz, K', 'Xu, Z-Y', 'Loignon, M', 'Alaoui-Jamali, M A', 'Panasci, L']","['Aloyz R', 'Grzywacz K', 'Xu ZY', 'Loignon M', 'Alaoui-Jamali MA', 'Panasci L']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B Davis - Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",2004/01/09 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/01/09 05:00'],"['2004/01/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403247 [doi]', '2403247 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Mar;18(3):409-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403247.,,,,,"['Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):1103-5; author reply 1105-6; discussion 1106-7.

We explored the effects of HPR on human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-positive and HTLV-I-negative malignant T-cell lines, most of which are resistant to all-trans retinoic acid. Clinically achievable concentrations of HPR caused a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation, G(0)/G(1) arrest, and massive apoptosis in all tested malignant T cells, while no effect was observed on resting or activated normal lymphocytes. Interestingly, HTLV-I-negative cell lines were significantly more sensitive to HPR compared to HTLV-I-positive and Tax-transfected cells. In HTLV-I-negative cells only, HPR-induced apoptosis was associated with ceramide accumulation, sharp decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3, and could be partially reverted by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD suggesting that Tax protects infected cells from ceramide accumulation and caspase-mediated apoptosis. In HTLV-I-positive cells, HPR treatment rapidly induced proteasomal-mediated degradation of p21, downregulated cyclin D(1), and upregulated bax protein levels. These findings support a potential therapeutic role for HPR in both HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-I-negative peripheral T-cell lymphomas.",,"['Darwiche, N', 'Hatoum, A', 'Dbaibo, G', 'Kadara, H', 'Nasr, R', 'Abou-Lteif, G', 'Bazzi, R', 'Hermine, O', 'de The, H', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Darwiche N', 'Hatoum A', 'Dbaibo G', 'Kadara H', 'Nasr R', 'Abou-Lteif G', 'Bazzi R', 'Hermine O', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Biology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. darwichn@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/01/09 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/01/09 05:00'],"['2004/01/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403245 [doi]', '2403245 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Mar;18(3):607-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-10, a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties, is a potent growth and survival factor for malignant B cells. To further examine the in vivo requirement for IL-10 in the development and expansion of malignant B-1 clones in NZB mice, we developed a strain of homozygous IL-10 knockout (KO) mice on an NZB background. The NZB IL-10 KO mice develop peritoneal B-1 cells with approximately the same frequency as heterozygous and wild-type littermates. In contrast, the development of malignant B-1 cells in the peripheral blood and spleen, observed in wild-type NZB, rarely occurred in the NZB IL-10 KO. Phenotypic analysis of surface marker expression in splenic B cells indicated that, in contrast to the NZB with malignant B-1 splenic lymphoma, the surface marker expression of NZB IL-10 KO splenic B cells indicated that the majority of the B cells were typical B-2 cells. In the absence of IL-10, spontaneously activated B cells and antiapoptotic gene expression were reduced and lymphoma incidence was decreased.

When compared with the 'favourable' group, patients with 6q- showed a higher white blood cell (WBC) count, frequent splenomegaly, atypical morphology, CD38+ and short time from diagnosis to first treatment and short survival. A higher median WBC count was found in the 6q- group vs the intermediate-risk group; survival was shorter in the unfavourable group. To ascertain if the 6q- anomaly was an independent factor predicting for an inferior outcome among those patients with 'favourable' cytogenetics, we performed an analysis of prognostic factors in 105 patients (92 'favourable' plus 13 with 6q-), showing that the 6q- chromosome maintained its prognostic significance at multivariate analysis (P=0.02) along with stage (P=0.01). We conclude that CLL with 6q- is characterized by a high incidence of atypical morphology, classical immunophenotype with CD38 positivity and intermediate incidence of IGVH somatic hypermutation.

Biochemically, this correlates with a specific reduction of PML levels in the nuclear matrix fraction without affecting total PML levels. Similar results were obtained for the other major PML NB component, the Sp100 protein, indicating that DNA methylating agents lead to a general disassembly of PML NBs.

Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a central component of the senescence response, and is able to trigger the process when overexpressed in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). Senescence induced by PML in HDFs is characterized by a modest increase in p53 levels and activity, the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb and a reduced expression of E2F-dependent genes. To dissect the p53 and Rb family requirements for PML-induced senescence, we used the oncoproteins E6 and E7 from human papillomavirus type 16. We found that the coexpression of E6 and E7 inhibited the growth arrest and senescence induced by PML. In addition, these viral oncoproteins blocked the formation of PML bodies and excluded both p53 and Rb from PML bodies. Expression of dominant-negative p53 alone failed to block PML-induced senescence and expression of E6 only delayed the process. On the other hand, expression of E7 was sufficient to block PML-induced senescence, while an E7 mutant unable to bind Rb did not.

Past studies have suggested that traffic-related exposures can increase the risk of childhood cancer, particularly leukemia. METHODS: From California's statewide, population-based cancer registry, we identified cancers diagnosed in children younger than 5 years of age between 1988 and 1997. We matched these cases to California birth certificates. For each case, we randomly selected 2 control birth certificates, matched by birth date and sex. For each mother's residential address at the time of her child's birth, we calculated road density by summing the length of all roads within a 500-foot radius of the residence. Traffic density was based on road lengths and vehicle traffic counts for highways and major roads. RESULTS: The distributions of road and traffic density values were very similar for the 4369 cases and 8730 matched control subjects. For all cancer sites combined, the odds ratio (OR) for the highest road density exposure category, compared with the lowest, was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75-1.00). For all sites combined and for leukemia, the ORs were also below 1.0 for the highest traffic density exposure category (0.92 for both). For central nervous system tumors, the OR was 1.22 (CI = 0.87-1.70).

RT is derived from a large Gag-Pol polyprotein, and its synthesis requires a translational readthrough, a suppression of termination, at a stop codon at the end of the gag gene.

Response to conventional chemotherapy generally is poor. Treatment using purine analogs has achieved response rates between 25% and 60% in relapsed/refractory patients, with minimal toxicity. The highest response rates were seen with pentostatin and gemcitabine. Using purine analogs in combination therapy may improve response rates, albeit with an increased risk of toxicity. The role of purine analogs as first line therapy in patients who have otherwise favorable prognostic factors has not been defined. Monoclonal antibody therapy has emerged in the last decade as a promising approach in treating T-cell malignancies. Campath-1H is an effective and well-tolerated therapy in these diseases. Durable remissions have been seen in heavily pretreated patients and in up to two thirds of patients who had T-PLL, which is the largest disease group studied. These results in T-PLL are significantly better than those reported with other therapies; this suggests that Campath-1H should be moved to first line therapy in this aggressive disease. The way in which monoclonal antibodies work indicate that they may be particularly useful in treating patients who have minimal residual disease, and, in this setting, facilitate stem cell transplantation. In addition, the activity of Campath-1H to deplete T cells has been exploited in preparative regimens before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. These approaches may be worth further investigation in patients who have T-cell lymphomas.

Increase in the occurrence of animal brucellosis has also resulted indirectly in an increase in the prevalence of human infection. Absence of characteristic clinical symptoms, chronic nature of the infection and difficulty in isolation of the causal agent from the patients make the diagnosis of the disease more difficult. The serological tests employed for diagnosing human brucellosis vary in terms of their sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, a combination of serological tests is desirable.

Evidence has been found for significant regulatory/tolerogenic properties in the IGF-II B:11 - 25 sequence after analysis of the cytokine secretion profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from ten DQ8+ type 1 diabetic adolescents. In the thymus, IGF ligands and receptors also intervene in the control of T-cell proliferation and differentiation.

We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of autologous bone marrow transplantation with that of non-myeloablative chemotherapy alone (or no further treatment). METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching electronic databases and by examining the reference lists of relevant studies and review articles. Eligible studies were those that prospectively enrolled adults with acute myeloid leukemia and randomly assigned patients who were in first remission and who did not have a matched sibling donor to one of the two consolidation therapies. Two reviewers independently assessed all studies for relevance and validity. We used a fixed-effects model to calculate the ratio of probabilities for disease-free and overall survival at 48 months or at the nearest recorded assessment point for each study and for all studies combined. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 587 potentially relevant studies, 36 of which were retrieved for detailed evaluation. In the six studies eligible for this meta-analysis, a total of 1044 patients were randomly assigned to receive autologous bone marrow transplantation or non-myeloablative chemotherapy (five studies) or autologous bone marrow transplantation or no further treatment (one study). Compared with patients who received chemotherapy or no further treatment, patients who received autologous bone marrow transplantation had a better disease-free survival (ratio of disease-free survival probabilities = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.44; P =.006) but a similar overall survival (ratio of overall survival probabilities = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.15; P =.86).

The outcomes associated with simultaneous bilateral tunneled internal jugular infusion catheter placement in the HSCT recipient population were investigated in an attempt to determine whether simultaneous introduction of these catheters compounds or magnifies the risks (infection, venous thrombosis) associated with tunneled catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing HSCT and receiving bilateral tunneled infusion catheters in a single procedure were identified using a quality assurance data base. Medical records for the duration of catheterization were reviewed; 43 patients were included in the study (mean age, 42 years; range, 22-56). Diagnoses included acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 4), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 8), aplastic anemia (n = 2), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 17), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1), myelodysplasia (n = 4), myelofibrosis (n = 2), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine differences in infection rates between dual- and triple-lumen catheters. RESULTS: Forty-three pairs of catheters were placed. All met venous access needs for HSCT recipient care. Complete follow-up was achieved for 77 of 87 (89%) catheters. The overall infection rate was 0.25 per 100 catheter-days. The rate was 0.19 and 0.33 for dual- and triple-lumen catheters, respectively (P =.15). Mechanical failure did not differ between catheter types (dual: 0.14 episodes per 100 days, triple: 0.05 per 100 days, P =.2). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral multilumen tunneled infusion catheter placement in a single procedure using imaging guidance is safe with acceptable outcomes and meets venous access needs for HSCT.

Application of such constants or equations to children with disease states may lead to inappropriate conclusions since the ""normal"" relationships may become altered. AIMS AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis by taking measurements of body composition using dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as a ""gold standard"" method and calculating hydration and body potassium constants using isotopic water dilution and whole body potassium counting. Measurements of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) by two different analysers (RJL and Holtain) were also performed to allow comparison with body water measurements. RESULTS: Measurements were performed in 35 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and compared to those in 21 children treated for a variety of other malignancies and 32 healthy sibling controls. The mean hydration and potassium content of FFM was significantly reduced in the ALL group compared to both other malignancies and controls. Application of equations derived from controls for the measurement of FFM derived from bioelectrical impedance led to an underestimation of 1.15 kg when compared to that derived from DEXA in children treated for ALL but not in other malignancies. For all groups combined, BIA was significantly different in the two analysers.

Recently, TLRs 2 and 4 have been demonstrated for the ligand engagements, which result in the induction of cytokines. Here we investigated the expression of TLRs 2 and 4 on lymphatic vessels producing cys-cys chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) in the human small intestine. The specificity of antibodies to TLRs was tested on a human monocyte leukemia cell line, umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) with the examination for the TLR gene expression by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and lymphatic vessels were identified by antibodies for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and desmoplakin. The expression of CCL21 was not clearly detected on collecting lymphatic vessels in the submucosa while it was generally observed on the central lacteals of villi and lymphatic capillaries in the lamina propria mucosae. The reaction of antibodies to TLRs 2 and 4 was also not clearly detected on collecting lymphatic vessels in the submucosa and central lacteals of villi, but generally observed on lymphatic capillaries expressing CCL21 in the lamina propria mucosae of tissue where the expression of CCL21 and TLRs was not clearly observed in blood vessels. These may suggest that the expression of CCL21, and TLRs 2 and 4 is predominantly induced in the peripheral lymphatic endothelium of the small intestinal microcirculation.

BLV-infected cells are present in marketed beef and dairy products. In the decade after the discovery of BLV in 1969, studies using agar gel immunodiffusion and complement fixation assays failed to find antibodies to BLV in human sera. This led to the prevailing opinion that exposure of humans to BLV and/or the potential for infection are not significant and therefore the virus is not a public health hazard. We reexamined this issue using more sensitive immunological techniques available today. Using immunoblotting to test the sera of 257 humans for antibodies of four isotypes (IgG1, IgM, IgA, and IgG4) to the BLV capsid antigen (p24), we detected at least one antibody isotype reactive with BLV in 74% of the human sera tested. The specificity of the reactivity was strongly suggested by competition studies and by ruling out cross-reacting antibodies to other chronic human viruses. Our results suggest that antibodies reactive with the BLV capsid antigen may serve as a biomarker for exposure to BLV and this exposure may be widespread. The results do not necessarily mean that humans are actually infected with BLV; the antibodies could be a response to heat-denatured BLV antigens consumed in food.

Hop bitter acids displayed a strong growth inhibitory effect against human leukemia HL-60 cells, with an estimated IC(50) value of 8.67 microg/mL, but were less effective against human histolytic lymphoma U937 cells. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed in HL-60 cells by DNA fragmentation and the appearance of a sub-G1 DNA peak, which were preceded by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and subsequent induction of pro-caspase-9 and -3 processing. Cleavages of PARP and DFF-45 were accompanied with activation of caspase-9 and -3 triggered by hop bitter acids in HL-60 cells. The change in the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bax in response to hop bitter acids was studied, and the Bcl-2 protein level slightly decreased; however, the Bcl-X(L) protein level was obviously decreased, whereas the Bax protein level was dramatically increased, indicating that the control of Bcl-2 family proteins by hop bitter acids might participate in the disruption of mitochondrial integrity. In addition, the results showed that hop bitter acids promoted the up-regulation of Fas and FasL prior to the processing and activation of pro-caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid, suggesting the involvement of a Fas-mediated pathway in hop bitter acids-induced cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that a certain intimate link might exist between receptor- and mitochondria-mediated death signalings that committed to cell death induced by hop bitter acids.

Rather, this event, especially in vitro, is explained by the fact that the TNF-alpha/TNF receptor system not only triggers downstream signals leading to apoptosis but also induces an antiapoptotic pathway through the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. The aim of this study was to determine whether inhibition of antiapoptotic pathways influences the susceptibility of mice to TNF-alpha. Here, we focused on the roles of NF-kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-regulated serine/threonine kinase Akt. METHODS: TNF-alpha was administered to BALB/c mice after treatment with an adenovirus expressing a mutant form IkappaBalpha (Ad5IkappaB), the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, or both. Liver injury was assessed biochemically and histologically. The expression of Bcl-2 family members and caspase activity were examined. RESULTS: In the mice livers, treatment with Ad5IkappaB or the wortmannin suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB or Akt, respectively. Suppression of either NF-kappaB or Akt showed a slight increase in transaminase levels and focal liver cell death after TNF-alpha administration. However, in mice treated with both Ad5IkappaB and wortmannin, TNF-alpha administration resulted in massive hepatocyte apoptosis and hemorrhagic liver destruction in mice. The combination of Ad5IkappaB, wortmannin, and TNF-alpha markedly increased the activation of caspase-3 and -9, and activated caspase-8 to a lesser degree, suggesting that TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis is dependent on type II cell death signaling pathway, probably through the mitochondria. Inhibition of the NF-kappaB and PI3K/Akt pathways had no effect on expression of Bcl-2 families. CONCLUSION: The inducible activation of NF-kappaB and constitutive activation of Akt regulate hepatocyte survival against TNF-alpha, which occurs independent of Bcl-2 families.",,"['Imose, Motoaki', 'Nagaki, Masahito', 'Naiki, Takafumi', 'Osawa, Yosuke', 'Brenner, David A', 'Asano, Takahiko', 'Hayashi, Hideki', 'Kato, Tomohiro', 'Moriwaki, Hisataka']","['Imose M', 'Nagaki M', 'Naiki T', 'Osawa Y', 'Brenner DA', 'Asano T', 'Hayashi H', 'Kato T', 'Moriwaki H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gifu University School of Medicine, Gifu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Liver Int,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,101160857,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'I-kappa B Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Liver Failure/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/01/08 05:00,2004/02/24 05:00,['2004/01/08 05:00'],"['2004/01/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1478-3231.2003.00867.x [doi]'],ppublish,Liver Int. 2003 Oct;23(5):386-96. doi: 10.1034/j.1478-3231.2003.00867.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) has been recognized as a potential risk factor associated with xenotransplantation. In this study, effects of the introduction of glycosyltransferase genes to pig cells on the sensitivity of gammaretroviruses to human serum were investigated. Pig endothelial cells (PEC), PEC transduced with alpha1,2 fucosyltransferase (FT), alpha2,3 sialyltransferase (ST), or N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transduced with the LacZ gene with the packaging signal of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) under the control of the long terminal repeat of MuLV by a pseudotype infection. Then, the cells were further infected with PERV subtype B (PERV-B) or feline leukemia virus subgroup B (FeLV-B). Culture supernatants of the infected cells were mixed with human serum (HS) and then inoculated to HEK293 cells. The inoculated cells were histochemically stained and lacZ-positive blue foci were counted. Glycosyltransferase activity, xenoantigenicity, and alpha-Gal epitope density in the cells were measured at the time of the infection experiments. PERV-B or FeLV-B particles from the parental PEC were efficiently neutralized by HS, while those from PEC transduced with alpha1,2FT, alpha2,3ST or GnT-III were less sensitive to HS. The transduced PEC exhibited high levels of activity of the introduced glycotransferases, and expressed fewer xenoantigens and cell-surface alpha-Gal epitopes. Our results suggest that gammaretroviruses including PERVs produced by transgenic pigs, that are generally modified to reduce the cell-surface alpha-Gal epitope to overcome the HAR in xenotransplantation, are less sensitive to HS.",,"['Kurihara, Takashi', 'Miyazawa, Takayuki', 'Miyagawa, Shuji', 'Tomonaga, Keizo', 'Hazama, Kenji', 'Yamada, Junko', 'Shirakura, Ryota', 'Matsuura, Yoshiharu']","['Kurihara T', 'Miyazawa T', 'Miyagawa S', 'Tomonaga K', 'Hazama K', 'Yamada J', 'Shirakura R', 'Matsuura Y']","['Research Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Xenotransplantation,Xenotransplantation,9438793,"['0 (Antigens, Heterophile)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 2.4.- (Glycosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Heterophile/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/*immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/enzymology/*virology', 'Epitopes', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*immunology', 'Glycosyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Serum/*immunology', 'Swine', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Zoonoses']",2004/01/08 05:00,2004/07/24 05:00,['2004/01/08 05:00'],"['2004/01/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.00056.x [doi]'],ppublish,Xenotransplantation. 2003 Nov;10(6):562-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.00056.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we analyzed, adopting a disease-oriented strategy, the tumour selectivity of this compound, its ability to induce apoptosis and its mechanism of interaction with DNA. The inhibition of cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay using a panel of 51 tumour cell lines. Some of them were also evaluated for the induction of apoptosis by 4'-6-diamidine-2'-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Western blot of p53 protein and agarose gel electrophoresis of ladder DNA. Finally, interstand cross-links (ISCL) were evaluated by ethidium bromide fluorescence technique. When evaluated by the MTT assay, DPR showed a high selective activity for neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), ovarian cancer and leukemia cell lines. The comparison of mean graphs of DPR and cisplatin suggested that our compound possesses a mechanism of action similar to that, at least in part, of its parent compound. Moreover, DPR showed itself to be a good trigger of programmed cell death, as demonstrated by DAPI staining, activation of p53 protein and agarose gel electrophoresis of ladder DNA. Finally, the study of the formation of ISCLs demonstrated that DPR, despite being a monofunctional platinum compound, is able to form bifunctional adducts through the release of procaine residue. Data presented here suggest that DPR is an antitumour agent able to trigger apoptosis, and that it is endowed with a peculiar mechanism(s) of action and a special selective activity against two tumours, namely neuroblastoma and SCLC, which are still characterized by a low incidence of long-term survivors.",,"['Mariggio, Maria A', 'Cafaggi, Sergio', 'Ottone, Massimo', 'Parodi, Brunella', 'Vannozzi, Maria O', 'Mandys, Vaclav', 'Viale, Maurizio']","['Mariggio MA', 'Cafaggi S', 'Ottone M', 'Parodi B', 'Vannozzi MO', 'Mandys V', 'Viale M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Sezione di Patologia Generale e Oncologia Sperimentale, Universita di Bari, Italy. maurizio.viale@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (cisplatin-procaine complex)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '4Z8Y51M438 (Procaine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Procaine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/01/07 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/01/07 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['5151109 [pii]', '10.1023/b:drug.0000006170.38419.c9 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2004 Jan;22(1):3-16. doi: 10.1023/b:drug.0000006170.38419.c9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tripeptide P2 (L-prolyl-m-L-sarcolysyl-p-L-fluorophenylalanine ethyl ester) has been suggested as the main contributor to PTC activity. In contrast to its analogue melphalan, m-L-sarcolysin never reached clinical use. To allow a direct comparison, the corresponding melphalan containing tripeptide J3 (L-prolyl-L-melphalanyl-p-L-fluorophenylalanine ethyl ester) was synthesized and its activity was compared with that of P2; the activities of melphalan and m-L-sarcolysin were studied in parallel. Cytotoxic activity in human tumor cell lines and some fresh human tumor specimens were analyzed as well as effects on cellular metabolism, macromolecular synthesis, and preliminary evaluation of the cell death characteristics. The results show that melphalan and m-L-sarcolysin display similar activity in these systems and that the tripeptides were more active than their parent monomers. Surprisingly however, the melphalan containing tripeptide J3 demonstrated a significantly more rapid and stronger activity than the m-L-sarcolysin analogue P2. Finally, the in vivo toxicity and activity of melphalan and J3 were investigated in mice bearing human leukemia cells in s.c. fibers.

Simultaneous exposure of cells to 100-ng/ml TRAIL with either 1-mM sodium butyrate or 2- micro M suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid resulted in a striking increase in leukemic cell mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Lethal effects were significantly diminished in U937 cells ectopically expressing dominant-negative caspase-8, dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain, CrmA (receptor pathway), or Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) (mitochondrial pathway). Analysis of mitochondrial events in U937 cells exposed to TRAIL/HDAC inhibitors revealed enhanced Bid activation and Bax translocation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor. No changes were observed in expression of FLICE-like inhibitory protein, TRAIL receptors, or reactive oxygen species generation. TRAIL/HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis triggered caspase-dependent cleavage of p21(WAF1/CIP1); moreover, enforced expression of a nuclear localization signal deletant form of p21(WAF1/CIP1) significantly diminished lethality. Lastly, p27(KIP1), pRb, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and Bcl-2 displayed extensive proteolysis. These findings indicate that coadministration of TRAIL with HDAC inhibitors synergistically induces apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells and provide further evidence that simultaneous activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in such cells leads to a dramatic increase in mitochondrial injury and activation of the caspase cascade.",,"['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Dai, Yun', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",2004/01/07 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/01/07 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Dec;2(12):1273-84.,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison with the gene expression profiles of purified normal B cell subpopulations, including germinal center (GC), pre-GC (naive), and post-GC (memory) B cells, shows that HCL cells are more related to memory cells, suggesting a derivation from this B cell population. Notably, when compared with memory cells, HCL cells displayed a remarkable conservation in proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA metabolism programs, whereas they appeared significantly altered in the expression of genes controlling cell adhesion and response to chemokines.

The complexity of illness management and disease sequela can alter their school experience. However, little is known about what educators are concerned about if these children are in their classroom. OBJECTIVE: To assess educators' perceptions of the impact of having children with different chronic health conditions in the classroom. METHODS: Teachers and other school professionals in 23 elementary schools were surveyed about the impact of having a child with each of 6 chronic health conditions--AIDS, asthma, congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and leukemia--in the classroom. They responded to 13 statements about the potential academic impact on the child, impact on peers, personal risk or liability, and additional time or attention demands for the teacher. Total scores were determined for the degree of perceived impact for each issue and chronic health condition and the proportion of teachers with negative perceptions for different issues. RESULTS: The mean total scores (2.4 of 5) showed overall a positive perception by school professionals about children with chronic conditions in the classroom. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and epilepsy were perceived to have the most impact and asthma the least impact. The 2 educator issues (time or extra attention and personal risk or liability) were of the most concern to educators. Fifty-three percent were concerned about an emergency occurring with the child in the classroom and 27% were concerned about legal liability. Educator concerns of the risk of classroom emergencies or death were disproportionate to the clinical risk of the conditions especially for epilepsy and congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Overall school professionals have positive attitudes about children with chronic health conditions in the classroom, but concerns about specific diseases and issues exist. If parents provide most of the disease information, some of the educators' concerns voiced in this study may not be addressed. Health care professionals can help by providing educators with appropriate information about the risk and functional impact of childhood chronic health conditions.",,"['Olson, Ardis L', 'Seidler, A Blair', 'Goodman, David', 'Gaelic, Susan', 'Nordgren, Richard']","['Olson AL', 'Seidler AB', 'Goodman D', 'Gaelic S', 'Nordgren R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med,Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,9422751,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Asthma', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease/*classification', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emergencies', 'Epilepsy', 'Faculty/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'New Hampshire', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vermont']",2004/01/07 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2004/01/07 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1001/archpedi.158.1.53 [doi]', '158/1/53 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2004 Jan;158(1):53-8. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.158.1.53.,,,,,['J Sch Nurs. 2004 Dec;20(6):359-60.

Cell proliferation is linked to apoptosis and controlled by several genes. During the cell life, specific events can stimulate proliferation while others may trigger the apoptotic pathway. Very few methods (i.e. TUNEL) are now available for studies aimed at correlation between apoptosis and proliferation. Therefore, there is interest in developing new methodological approaches that are able to correlate apoptosis to the cell cycle phases. Recently new approaches have been proposed to detect and enumerate apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Among these, the most established and applied are those based on the cell membrane modifications induced in the early phases of the apoptotic process. The dye pair Hoechst 33342 (HO) and Propidium Iodide (PI), thanks to their peculiar characteristics to be respectively permeable and impermeable to the intact cell membrane, seems to be very useful. Unfortunately the spectral interaction of these dyes generates a consistent ""energy transfer"" from HO to PI. The co-presence of the dyes in a nucleus results in a modification in the intensity of both the emitted fluorescences. In order to designate the damaged cells (red fluorescence) to the specific cell cycle phases (blue fluorescence), we have tested different staining protocols aimed to minimize the interference of these dyes as much as possible. In cell culture models, we are able to detect serum-starved apoptotic cells as well as to designate their exact location in the cell cycle phases using a very low PI concentration. Using a Partec PAS flow cytometer equipped with HBO lamp and argon ion laser, a double UV/blue excitation has been performed. This analytical approach is able to discriminate live blue cells from the damaged (blue-red) ones even at 0.05 micro g/mL PI. The same instrumental setting allows performing other multi-colour analyses including AnnexinV-FITC as well as the possibility to make a correlated analysis to phenotype markers.",,"['Mazzini, G', 'Ferrari, C', 'Erba, E']","['Mazzini G', 'Ferrari C', 'Erba E']","['Istituto di Genetica Molecolare del CNR, Sezione di Istochimica e Citometria, Piazza Botta 10, 27100 Pavia, Italy. mazzi@igm.cnr.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur J Histochem,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,9207930,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/instrumentation/*methods', 'Ploidies']",2004/01/07 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/01/07 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Histochem. 2003;47(4):289-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two recombinant adenoviral vectors, AdsFas with murine soluble Fas gene and AdEGFP with enhanced GFP protein gene, were constructed by homologous recombination between two plasmids in Escherichia coli with the AdEasy adenovirus vector system. The viruses were propagated and purified by two times ultracentrifugation. Their titres were detected by plaque assays. The expressed protein was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Then the tumor EL4 cells were infected with AdsFas and AdEGFP respectively. The apoptosis ratio of the target cells-YAC-1 cells induced by EL4 cells was respectively detected by (3)H-thymidine ((3)H-TdR) labeling. The results showed that the recombinant adenoviral vectors AdsFas and AdEGFP were successfully obtained. The titres of viruses purified by two times ultracentrifugation were up to 10(11) pfu/ml by plaque assays. The sFas protein was highly expressed in the target cells by Western blot analysis. After the EL4 cells were transfected with the adenoviruses AdsFas, the apoptosis rate of YAC-1 cells in the sFas transfection group (respectively 6%, 7% and 9% when the effector:target (E:T) was 3:1, 10:1 and 30:1) was obviously lower than that in the control group (respectively 28%, 37% and 45%), P < 0.01. But when the EL4 cells were transfected with AdEGFP, the apoptosis rate of YAC-1 cells (respectively 30%, 36% and 48%) was similar to the control group, P > 0.05. In conclusion, the transfer of sFas by adenovirus could inhibit the apoptosis of Fas(+) cells-YAC-1 cells induced by tumor EL4 cells. It showed that the transduction of sFas could block the effect of the immune escape of EL4 cells through FasL in vitro. These results thus provide a new direction to find a way to treat tumors.",,"['Hu, Zhong-Bo', 'Zou, Ping', 'Li, Ai-Xiang', 'Wang, Liang-Li', 'Liu, Ling-Bo']","['Hu ZB', 'Zou P', 'Li AX', 'Wang LL', 'Liu LB']","['Institute of hematology, Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Transfection']",2004/01/07 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2004/01/07 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2003)06-0616-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Dec;11(6):616-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human erythroleukemic cell line K562 and its adriamycin-resistant counterpart K562/A02 were used in the study. The cells were co-cultured with ADR and BBM in different concentrations. MTT assay was used to analyze the effect of BBM on cell growth inhibition. According to the MTT assay, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), the multiples of drug resistance and increased sensitivity of ADR were calculated. The concentration of intracellular ADR and expression level of P-gp were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression level of mdr1 mRNA and survivin mRNA was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with beta-actin as internal reference. The results showed that IC(50) of ADR in K562 and K562/A02 cells was 1.16 +/- 0.09 micro mol/L and 37.47 +/- 1.76 micro mol/L, respectively. The resistant multiple of K562/A02 cells to ADR was 32.30 higher than that of K562 cells.

To establish a retroviral-mediated antisense RNA transfer system of uPAR gene for exploring its function on down-regulation of uPAR expression in leukemia cells, the retroviral vector LaCD87SN was constructed by inserting uPAR gene into LXSN vector in an antisense orientation. An uPAR gene antisense RNA transfer system was established by liposome-mediated transfection in combination with cross infection with retrovirus. Human leukemia cells U937 were transduced with aCD87 amphotropic retrovirus, expressing uPAR antisense RNA, and the U937/aCD87 cells was obtained by G418 selection. The integration and expression of antisense uPAR gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The cell surface expression of CD87 and the activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) were assayed by flow cytometry (FCM) and gelatin zymography, respectively. The results showed that the amphotropic retroviral producers Am12/aCD87, which expressed antisense RNA of uPAR gene with a titer of 6.3 x 10(5) cfu/ml in supernatants, were obtained by means of transfection and superinfection. U937/aCD87 cells were established by continuative G418 selection after retrovirus infection. In U937/aCD87 cells, the integrated provirus and the overexpression of antisense uPAR gene was confirmed.

The current PML/RARalpha amplification techniques with conventional nested PCR are laborious and time consuming, which fails to meet the requirements for rapid diagnosis of APL in clinical practice. Therefore, an easily handled RT-PCR methodology for the rapid and accurate amplification of PML/RARalpha fusion transcripts is needed. A modified one round RT-PCR protocol was described with a few variations which includes rapid extraction of high quality cellular total RNA, cDNA synthesis with random hexamer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase, optimal concentrations of MgCl(2) (1 mmol/L), PCR primers (0.4 micro mol/L) and Taq polymerase (0.01 U/ micro l), hot-start procedure, and concomitant amplification of PML/RARalpha fusion gene and RARalpha internal control under the identical thermocycle parameters.

One complication is toxic leukoencephalopathy, which is due to a direct toxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents on the central nervous system white matter. Autopsies of four cases of toxic leukoencephalopathy were performed following standard protocols. The brain and spinal cord were examined routinely, and histological sections were taken for evaluation. We report here three patients with hematologic malignancies and one patient with metastatic carcinoma with chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy. The first was a 56-year-old male treated with multiple chemotherapeutics for multiple myeloma. He presented with confusion and focal seizures with a rapid progression to coma and decerebrate posturing. The second was a 36-year-old male who developed mental status changes, ataxia and dysarthria following treatment for lymphoma. The third was a 16-year-old male who developed a profound peripheral and central neuropathy after chemotherapy treatment for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The fourth was a 49-year-old female patient who was treated with multiple chemotherapeutics for Stage II breast carcinoma and subsequently developed visual acuity and field defects. The neuropathologic findings in these cases, although similar, varied in severity and distribution. The white matter was affected by severe myelin pallor, edema, and a prominent macrophage infiltrate in each of the cases. The location and extent of the central nervous system pathology correlated with the type and severity of clinical symptoms.

Here, we report that Hox A7, a gene frequently overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia, is down-regulated during HL-60 monocytic differentiation. Using a model in which HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate toward the monocytic lineage with bone marrow stromal-like cells, we demonstrate that Hox A7-sustained expression disturbs the regulation of cell adhesive and migratory capacities on fibronectin during early differentiation. We show that this is accompanied by a partial blockage of the transcriptional induction of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, a gene coding for a focal adhesion kinase active in monocytes, and of tissue transglutaminase, a gene coding for a fibronectin coreceptor in monocytes.

The enzyme activity is expressed specifically in intestinal epithelium and in liver. The intestinal enzyme not only plays an important role in providing animals with vitamin A, but also determines whether provitamin A carotenoids are converted to vitamin A or circulated in the body as intact carotenoids. We have found that a high fat diet enhanced the beta-carotene dioxygenase activity together with the cellular retinol binding protein type II level in rat intestines. Flavonols with a catechol structure in the B-ring and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol inhibited the dioxygenase activity of pig intestinal homogenates and the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol in Caco-2 human intestinal cells. Thus, the bioavailability of dietary provitamin A carotenoids might be modulated by the other food components ingested. Regulation of the dioxygenase activity and its relation to the retinoid metabolism as well as to lipid metabolism deserve further study. In contrast to enzymatic cleavage, it is known that both retinal and beta-apocarotenals are formed in vitro from beta-carotene by chemical transformation, which cleaves conjugated double bonds at random positions under various oxidative conditions. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that the oxidation products formed by chemical transformation might have specific actions on the proliferation of certain cancer cells. We have found that lycopene, a typical nonprovitamin A carotenoid, was cleaved in vitro to acycloretinal, acycloretinoic acid and apolycopenals in a nonenzymatic manner, and that the mixture of oxidation products of lycopene induced apoptosis of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells.

METHODS: Different cytokines GM-CSF, IL-3 and GM-CS/IL-3 fusion protein were added into the irradiated Tf-1 cells. MTT assay, morphology, flow cytometry, and DNA fragmentation assay were used to observe the effects of cytokines on apoptosis. The caspase-3 activity was determined with a fluorocytometer. RESULTS: Irradiated Tf-1 cells showed typical morphological characteristic of apoptosis demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and were accumulated in G0/G1 phase. In the groups treated with growth factors after irradiation, three cytokines significantly increased the viability rate, distinctly decreased the apoptosis rate and the proportion of DNA fragmentation. When Tf-1 cells were irradiated by gamma irradiation, caspase-3 activity was increased at different time points. In comparison with the control group in which no growth factor was added after the cells were irradiated, the caspase-3 activity of irradiated Tf-1 cells was significantly inhibited by addition of the above cytokines. Thirty-six hours after irradiation, in the control group, GM-CSF, IL-3, GM-CSF and IL-3 in combination, and two GM-CSF/IL-3 fusion protein groups, the apoptosis rate was 73 %, 11 %, 15 %, 13 %, 12 %, and 13 %. The percent of fragmented DNA was 36 %, 19 %, 18 %, 14 %, 13 %, and 14 %. The fluorescence intensity was 16923, 5529, 6581, 5322, 5426, and 5485. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF, IL-3, and GM-CSF/IL-3 fusion protein could protect Tf-1 cells from apoptosis induced by gamma irradiation. After Tf-1 cells were irradiated, the caspase-3 activity was significantly increased but was dramatically decreased by the above cytokines.

These pyrophosphate analogs not only reduce the occurrence of skeletal events but also provide clinical benefit to patients and improve the survival of some of them. The existence of these capabilities raises the possibility that these compounds may have a direct antiproliferative effect on tumor cells. To investigate whether these drugs exert a direct antitumor effect, we exposed human myeloma cell lines ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 to increasing concentrations of zoledronic acid (ZOL) in vitro. A concentration- but not time-dependent cytotoxic effect was detected with drug treatment of ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 cell lines (30% and 60% at 48 hours and 38% and 62% at 72 hours, respectively, for 50 microM of ZOL). Cytotoxicity was not due to ZOL-induced chelation of extracellular calcium as shown by control experiments with the calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Addition of the competitive inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did not modulate ZOL-induced cytotoxicity. However, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells was detected when protein kinase C was inhibited by addition of staurosporine to ZOL-containing cultures. Cytotoxicity also was increased by addition of dexamethasone (Dex) and thalidomide (Thal) to ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 cultures. We demonstrated that exposing myeloma cell lines ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 to ZOL inhibits cell growth in a dose-dependent but not a time-dependent manner and that combination of Dex and Thal with ZOL induces apoptotic cell death, providing a rationale for potential applications in vivo.",,"['Ural, A Ugur', 'Yilmaz, M Ilker', 'Avcu, Ferit', 'Pekel, Aysel', 'Zerman, Murat', 'Nevruz, Oral', 'Sengul, Ali', 'Yalcin, Atilla']","['Ural AU', 'Yilmaz MI', 'Avcu F', 'Pekel A', 'Zerman M', 'Nevruz O', 'Sengul A', 'Yalcin A']","['Department of Hematology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. aural@gata.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Thalidomide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zoledronic Acid']",2004/01/06 05:00,2004/04/28 05:00,['2004/01/06 05:00'],"['2004/01/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983818 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Dec;78(5):443-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02983818.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In infant leukemias, the chromosome translocations involving MLL arise during fetal hematopoiesis, possibly in a primitive lymphomyeloid stem cell. In general, these leukemias have a very poor prognosis. The malignancy of these leukemias is all the more dramatic considering their very short preclinical natural history or latency.

The aim of this study was to examine whether biological effects such as different modes of cell death and gene expression modifications related to tumorgenesis are detectable above the threshold defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukaemia cells (HL-60) grown in vitro were exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF; t 1/2(r) about 1 ns; field strength about 25 times higher than the ICNIRP reference levels for occupational exposure) leading to non-thermal effects using a high-voltage-improved GTEM cell 5302 (EMCO) connected to a pulse generator NP20 (C = 1 nF, U(Load) = 20kV). HL-60 cells were harvested at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after radiation exposure. Micronuclei, apoptosis and abnormal cells (e.g. necrosis) were determined using morphological criteria. In parallel, the expression of 1176 genes was measured using Atlas Human 1.2. Array. Based on high data reproducibility calculated from two independent experiments (> 99%), array analysis was performed. RESULTS: No significant change in apoptosis, micronucleation, abnormal cells and differential gene expression was found. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of HL-60 cells to EMFs 25 times higher than the ICNIRP reference levels for occupational exposure failed to induce any changes in apoptosis, micronucleation, abnormal morphologies and gene expression.

These cells are also increased in the bone marrow, skin, and other organs in systemic mastocytosis. Flavonoids are naturally occurring molecules with antioxidant, cytoprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities. Some flavonoids, like quercetin, inhibit the growth of certain malignant cells in culture. Quercetin also inhibits histamine release and induces accumulation of secretory granules in rat basophilic leukemia cells. METHOD: We investigated the effect of five flavonoids: flavone, kaempferol, morin, myricetin, and quercetin at 1, 10, and 100 microM on proliferation and secretory mediator content (beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, and tryptase) in human leukemic mast cells (HMC-1), the doubling time of which was about 2 d. RESULTS: Flavone and kaempferol at 100 microM inhibited cell proliferation over 80% on either day 3, 4, or 5 of culture. Quercetin showed this level of inhibition only on day 5, myricetin inhibited by 50% at days 3-5, whereas morin's inhibition was < 20%. All flavonoids (except morin) at 100 microm increased histamine and tryptase content, but not beta-hexosaminidase, equally at days 3 and 4 of culture quercetin also increased the development of secretory granules.

In the present study, four new structural changes involving chromosomes 17 and 12 in CLL/SLL patients are described. METHODS: Five patients were selected for inclusion in the present report among a total of 92 cases with diagnosis of CLL/SLL. Cytogenetic studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect some of the most frequent cryptic aberrations occurring in CLL/SLL patients were performed. Clinical studies are also described. RESULTS: Four cases showed structural rearrangements of chromosome 17. A psu dic(17;2)(p11.2;p21), leading to p53 deletion, was observed in a patient who developed a mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease coexisting with the CLL/SLL in the same lymph node.

The transient expression was studied in three cell lines: K562, HEL and 293, and indicated increased promoter activity of the promoter containing the Brazilian mutation in all cell lines. The protein-DNA interaction showed that, in contrast to the Agamma-198 T --> C mutation which has increased affinity for the Sp1 protein and creates a motif that behaves like a novel CACCC box in the gamma promoter, the Brazilian HPFH mutation decreases the affinity at the Sp1 protein and does not act as a CACCC motif. These results suggest that this mutation may act to increase the Agamma-globin chain production.

METHODS: The viabilities of Jurkat T lymphocytes (JK), TJK [JK with over-expression of the CD8epsilon chimeria molecule] and T3JK [JK with over-expression of the CD8epsilon (Y170F/Y181F) mutation molecule] cells were cultured and treated with pre-coated anti-CD8 mAb (200 micro g/ml) and/or 5-FU (2.5 micro g/ml) were detected with MTS assay and the apoptosis percentages were calculated. Western blot was used to detect P53 expression. To confirm the role of P53 in 5-FU-treated T lymphocytes, pCMV-p53 plasmid with wild type or mutant p53 were co-transfected transiently with pEGFP-c1 into TJK and T3JK cells, respectively.

The cells transfected with wild-type p53 exhibited more sensitivity to 5-FU than that transfected with mutant p53.

As a result of this role disruption of SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions results in mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors and standard mobilization protocols disrupt this axis. Similarly SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions are required for homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells during transplantation. SDF-1 regulates the localisation of leukemic cells and like their normal counterparts most leukemic cells respond to SDF-1 with increased adhesion, survival and proliferation. However in some instances leukemic cell responses to SDF-1 can be disregulated, the impact of which on the progression of disease in not known.

Although the role of nuclear PML-RARalpha has been extensively studied, a significant amount of PML-RARalpha is in the cytoplasm. The role cytoplasmic PML-RARalpha plays in leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we report that PML-RARalpha induces the N-CoR accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the induction of ER stress and the processing of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), the unfolded protein response. PML-RARalpha stimulates the ubiquitylation of N-CoR via Ubc6 that is involved in the protein quality control. This ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of N-CoR reduces the soluble N-CoR protein levels in the nucleus. The two N-CoR-interacting sites in PML-RARalpha are required for the ERAD of N-CoR, suggesting the aberrant binding of PML-RARalpha to N-CoR may induce the ERAD of N-CoR.

In Children's Cancer Group Pilot Study CCG-2941, we assessed toxicity and feasibility of substituting 4 mg of DNR with 1 mg of IDA in intensive-timing daunorubicin-based induction therapy (DNR/DNR) used in CCG-2891. PATIENTS AND METHODS: On days 1 through 3 and 10 through 14, patients received two courses of dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, etoposide, and IDA (IDA/IDA). After enrollment of 65 patients, toxicity prompted replacement of IDA with DNR (IDA/DNR) on days 10 through 14 for the remaining 28 patients. Outcomes were compared with those of intensive timing in CCG-2891. RESULTS: Treatment-related mortality after two courses of induction was not significantly different among the three regimens: 14% with IDA/IDA, 7% with IDA/DNR, and 9% with DNR/DNR. In course 1 of CCG-2941 IDA/IDA, 11% of patients withdrew compared with 1.5% in CCG-2891 (P <.001) and 5% in CCG-2941 IDA/DNR (P = not significant). Compared with CCG-2891 DNR/DRN, CCG-2941 IDA/IDA increased days in hospital (43 v 36 days; P =.007), mean duration of course 1 by a week (P =.002), and risk of grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (18% v 5%; P =.02). Toxicity of IDA/DNR was not different from that of DNR/DNR in CCG-2891. The mean day 7 marrow blast percentage was 11.4% in CCG-2941 versus 21.1% in CCG-2891 (P =.004).

First, we examined the gene expression of HGF and its receptor, c-met, by whole-mount in situ hybridization during development. Strong signals of HGF as well as c-met were detected early in the developing ventral mesoderm, which later gives rise to the ventral blood island. Furthermore, to study the role of HGF, we blocked the HGF signaling pathway in Xenopus embryos by using truncated c-met lacking the tyrosine kinase domain. Injection of truncated c-met mRNA resulted in a marked decrease in the number of circulating blood cells. Similar results were obtained using morpholino antisense HGF oligonucleotides. Moreover, we also analyzed the expression of several early primitive blood markers in the blood island of these embryos.

In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the levels of expression of early definitive blood markers, SCL, GATA-2, and GATA-3 in the dorsolateral plate, as analyzed by in situ hybridization.

To clarify this necessity, we established 2 arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3))-resistant subclones of the APL cell line, NB4. Both resistant lines showed little activation of JNK1 following treatment with As(2)O(3), even at doses sufficient to elicit robust activation in NB4 cells. One mechanism of resistance in these cells is up-regulated glutathione (GSH) content, and GSH depletion by l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) restores JNK activation and As(2)O(3) sensitivity. This correlation between JNK activation and apoptosis led us to test whether inhibition of JNK would protect cells from As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. SEK1(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) showed diminished JNK activation following As(2)O(3) treatment and were protected from As(2)O(3)-induced but not doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of arsenic trioxide-sensitive APL cells with the JNK inhibitor, dicumarol, significantly increased growth and survival in response to As(2)O(3) but did not protect cells from doxorubicin. Together, these data support an essential role for JNK signaling in the induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis by As(2)O(3) and suggest that activating JNK may provide a therapeutic advantage in the treatment of cancers that do not respond to arsenic alone.",,"['Davison, Kelly', 'Mann, Koren K', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Davison K', 'Mann KK', 'Waxman S', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

This network, comprising humoral and cellular cross talk, is responsible for the adaptation of hematopoietic populations to demands as they arise. Major components of this control system are death receptors and their specific ligands, which eliminate superfluous cells once they have fulfilled their respective functions. The important role of Fas (CD95/Apo-1), one member of this death receptor family, in the regulation of T- and B-cell functions has been established. Alteration of Fas expression and/or function in lymphoid cells may contribute to the development of autoimmunity and/or neoplastic diseases. In addition to controlling lymphoid compartments, Fas is also involved in the regulation of myeloid cell functions. More recently, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its specific receptors (TRAIL-R) have been identified as further members of this death receptor/ligand family. The TRAIL-R/TRAIL system is of vital importance for the maturation and functioning of immune effector cells of lymphoid, as well as myeloid, origin.

Future spinal cord repair strategies should comprise a multi-factorial approach addressing several issues, including optimalization of survival and function of spared central nervous system neurons in partial lesions and the modulation of trophic and inhibitory influences to promote and guide axonal regrowth. Neurotrophins have emerged as promising molecules to augment neuroprotection and neuronal regeneration. Although intracerebroventricular, intrathecal and local protein delivery of neurotrophins to the injured spinal cord has resulted in enhanced survival and regeneration of injured neurons, there are a number of drawbacks to these methods. Viral vector-mediated transfer of neurotrophin genes to the injured spinal cord is emerging as a novel and effective strategy to express neurotrophins in the injured nervous system. Ex vivo transfer of neurotrophic factor genes is explored as a way to bridge lesions cavities for axonal regeneration. Several viral vector systems, based on herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, and moloney leukaemia virus, have been employed. The genetic modification of fibroblasts, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing glia cells, and stem cells, prior to implantation to the injured spinal cord has resulted in improved cellular nerve guides. So far, neurotrophic factor gene transfer to the injured spinal cord has led to results comparable to those obtained with direct protein delivery, but has a number of advantages. The steady advances that have been made in combining new viral vector systems with a range of promising cellular platforms for ex vivo gene transfer (e.g., primary embryonic neurons, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheating glia cells and neural stem cells) holds promising perspectives for the development of new neurotrophic factor-based therapies to repair the injured nervous system.",,"['Hendriks, William T', 'Ruitenberg, Marc J', 'Blits, Bas', 'Boer, Gerard J', 'Verhaagen, Joost']","['Hendriks WT', 'Ruitenberg MJ', 'Blits B', 'Boer GJ', 'Verhaagen J']","['Graduate School for Neurosciences Amsterdam, Department of Neuroregeneration, Netherlands Institute for Brain Research, Meibergdreef 33, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Prog Brain Res,Progress in brain research,0376441,['0 (Nerve Growth Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Administration Routes', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Nerve Growth Factors/genetics/*therapeutic use', '*Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurons/drug effects/virology', 'Recovery of Function', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*therapy/virology', 'Time Factors']",2004/01/01 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2004/01/01 05:00'],"['2004/01/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0079-6123(03)46029-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0079-6123(03)46029-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Brain Res. 2004;146:451-76. doi: 10.1016/S0079-6123(03)46029-9.,,,,,,175,,,,,,,,,,,

NT-3 plays an essential role in the development of both the neural-crest-derived peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system (i.e., Chalazonitis, 1996, Mol. Neurobiol., 12: 39-53; Sieber-Blum, 1999, Neurotrophins and the Neural Crest, CRC Press, Boca Raton). This review integrates data obtained from our laboratory and from our collaboration with other investigators that demonstrate a late-acting role for NT-3 in the development of enteric neurons in vitro and in vivo. Studies of the biological actions of NT-3 on enteric neuronal precursors in vitro demonstrate that NT-3 acts directly on the precursor cells and that it also acts in combination with other neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and a ciliary neurotrophic factor-like molecule, to promote the survival and differentiation of enteric neurons and glia. Importantly, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and BMP-4, members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, regulate the onset of action of NT-3 during fetal gut development. Analyzes performed on mice deficient in the genes encoding NT-3 or its transducing tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkC, and conversely on transgenic mice that overexpress NT-3 substantiate a physiological role for NT-3 in the development and maintenance of a subset of enteric neurons. There is loss of neurons in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of mice lacking NT-3/TrkC signaling and selective hyperplasia in the myenteric plexus of mice overexpressing NT-3. Analyzes performed on transgenic mice that overexpress noggin, a specific BMP-4 antagonist, show significant decreases in the density of TrkC-expressing neurons but significant increase in overall neuronal density of both plexuses. Conversely, overexpression of BMP-4 is sufficient to produce, an increase in the proportion of TrkC-expressing neurons in both plexuses.

Report of four cases].,1003-11,"Insufficiency of the pituitary gland and hematological abnormalities may coexist in the context of two syndromes. In the course of some hematopoietic neoplasms, particularly acute leukemias, the pituitary insufficiency may be caused by destruction of the gland either by direct neoplastic infiltration or occlusion of vessels. Alternatively, thy pituitary dysfunction may be associated with but not caused by hematological abnormalities, usually mild peripheral cytopenias. We present four cases of the latter type (1. M/33, pituitary tumor, hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, anemia, mild leukopenia with leukocytosis, 2. F/54, pituitary tumor, hyperprolactinemia, thyreotropic and corticotropic insufficiency, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mild neutropenia, 3. F/27, pituitary tumor, diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism, sideropenic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 4. M/24, primary multihormonal insufficiency of the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, neutropenia, microcytosis). Trephine and aspiration bone marrow biopsies revealed topographic and cytological abnormalities partially resembling these found in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Bone marrow cellularity varied markedly between and within the cases, and in three patients abnormal aplastic areas were found. The percentage of hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) was low in three cases and normal in one case. Pituitary dysfunction may be associated with hematological abnormalities simulating MDS, but showing different, less aggressive clinical course. The proliferative potential of hematopoietic cells is low, the peripheral blood abnormalities are stable, and no patient developed acute leukemia.

METHODS: Ligand-mediated cell adhesion was characterized by the development of a cellulose hollow-fiber adhesion assay in which ligand (protein A) was immobilized onto the cellulose membrane as a recombinant fusion protein containing a cellulose-binding domain affinity tag. Modules containing single cellulose hollow fibers were connected to a micro-flow system for cell deposition and detachment with fluid shear stress. The cell adhesion process that occurred inside a segment of hollow fiber was observed in real time by using an inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera and digital frame grabber. Image analysis software was developed to count cells and record digital images. RESULTS: Cell adhesion strength was characterized by counting the number of cells that were detached by application of fluid shear stress with values that ranged from 2.3 to 185 dyne/cm2. The median shear stress of detachment of KG1a cells was directly related to the duration of membrane contact and the amount of immobilized monoclonal antibody (anti-CD34). CONCLUSIONS: The hollow-fiber assay provides a general method to determine functional properties of molecular domains that interact with cell surface receptors and markers.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Nordon, Robert E', 'Shu, Alan', 'Camacho, Fernando', 'Milthorpe, Bruce K']","['Nordon RE', 'Shu A', 'Camacho F', 'Milthorpe BK']","['Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. r.nordon@unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

The few studies conducted so far in children with ALL have reported wide variability in the prevalence of prothrombotic defects and its impact on the risk of TE. The prevalence of prothrombotic defects varies in different ethnic population. Since different ALL therapy studies use different chemotherapeutic agents in various dosage and combination, it is important that every major study group assesses the risk of TE, including the prevalence of prothrombotic defects, within their therapy plan.

The results were retrospectively analyzed between the two groups on the basis of the day of treatment after ovulation: early luteal phase (days 0-3 postovulation) and mid-luteal phase (days 4-7 after ovulation). Mifepristone used in EC in the present study resulted in general loss of functional integrity of epithelial compartment characterized by loss of secretory maturation, increased apoptosis and higher degree of degeneration along with decreased expression of VEGF, LIF, PP14 and ER, while PR level increased as compared to control samples. The vascular compartment appeared to be compromised along with affected morphological features and decreased expression of VEGF, LIF, ER and PR following the administration of mifepristone. It appears that mifepristone used in EC alters the physiological homeostasis in epithelial and vascular compartments of implantation stage endometrium rendering it hostile to blastocyst implantation. Furthermore, the degree to which the endometrial function is affected largely depends on the day of mifepristone treatment in a parameter-specific manner resulting in a higher degree of degenerative changes in samples obtained from animals who received mifepristone during mid-luteal phase of cycles.",,"['Sengupta, Jayasree', 'Dhawan, Latika', 'Lalitkumar, P G L', 'Ghosh, D']","['Sengupta J', 'Dhawan L', 'Lalitkumar PG', 'Ghosh D']","['Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Contraception,Contraception,0234361,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral)', '0 (Contraceptives, Postcoital, Synthetic)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Contraceptives, Oral/pharmacology', 'Contraceptives, Postcoital, Synthetic/*pharmacology', 'Endometrium/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/drug effects', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Menstrual Cycle/drug effects', 'Mifepristone/*pharmacology', 'Models, Animal', 'Molecular Chaperones/drug effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/drug effects', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/drug effects', '*Proteins', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/drug effects']",2003/12/31 05:00,2004/03/20 05:00,['2003/12/31 05:00'],"['2003/12/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0010782403001082 [pii]', '10.1016/s0010-7824(03)00108-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Contraception. 2003 Dec;68(6):453-69. doi: 10.1016/s0010-7824(03)00108-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the prevalence of thyroid, parathyroid, gonadal, and pancreatic beta-cell function in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). MATERIALS AND METHOD: Forty-six patients (12 women, 34 men), aged 1.5 to 49 years (mean, 15.1 years), were evaluated for thyroid, parathyroid, gonadal, and pancreatic beta-cell function before and 3, 6, and 12 months after BMT with a little busulfan-cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen. RESULTS: Thyroid and parathyroid function was unaltered by BMT. Leydig cell function was normal in 11 adult men (G5P5) before and at 3, 6, and 12 months after BMT, but injury to the germinal epithelium (oligo- or azoospermia) was seen before and 12 months after BMT. There was no relationship between serum FSH and germinal epithelial injury. Maturation was normal in six boys (G2P2 or G3P3 at BMT) 12 months post-BMT. Primary hypogonadism was seen in four adult women (B5P5) after BMT. One 14-year-old girl continued to have regular menstrual periods during the 24 months after BMT. Another girl (P1B1 pre-BMT) developed ovarian failure 12 months post-BMT. Pancreatic beta-cell function was normal pre- and post-BMT in 12 thalassemic patients with serum ferritin > 1000 ng/mL.

RESULTS: Growth velocity at 1 year posttransplant was 10.0 +/- 3.5 cm/y. One year post-BMT, the statistical deviation saturation for growth velocity was 4.31 +/- 4.21. Height standard deviation score was -1.4 +/- 1.2 before and -0.5 +/- 1.3 1 year post-BMT (P <.004). The average weight of our subjects was 20 +/- 6 kg before and 26 +/- 9.5 kg 1 year post-BMT.

The apoptotic activities of these saturated and unsaturated 2-acetylaminoalcohols were examined in human leukemia HL-60 cells using MTT assay.

Qualitative analysis of DNA fragmentation caused by these compounds was conducted using agarose gel electrophoresis, and typical DNA fragmentation was found in the cases of (2R,3Z)- and (2S,3Z)-isomers such as C2-Cer, but not trans and saturated isomers. The morphological features of the cells, the proteolytic processing of pro-caspase-3, and the cleavage of PARP as a result of exogenous treatment with (2R,3Z)- and (2S,3Z)-isomers indicated that cell death induced by these compounds was apoptosis.

The remaining patients have one of three forms of atypical D-FISH patterns; these patterns have different sensitivities to detect disease. Neoplastic cells with one ABL, one BCR, and one BCR/ABL fusion are particularly problematic, because normal cells with coincidental overlap have the same pattern. For these patients, the normal cutoff for D-FISH is >23%. We tested a new method that incorporates an aqua-labeled probe for the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) gene into the conventional BCR/ABL D-FISH probe set. This tricolor D-FISH (TD-FISH) method takes advantage of the aqua-labeled ASS probe to distinguish between neoplastic and normal cells. We used TD-FISH to study 20 normal specimens and 35 specimens from 20 patients with known loss of both BCR and ABL from the derivative chromosome 9. The results show that TD-FISH effectively discriminates between cells with overlapping BCR and ABL signals from cells with true BCR/ABL fusion and improves the ability to quantify minimal residual disease from >23% to >1% of 500 interphase nuclei.",,"['Smoley, Stephanie A', 'Brockman, Stephanie R', 'Paternoster, Sarah F', 'Meyer, Reid G', 'Dewald, Gordon W']","['Smoley SA', 'Brockman SR', 'Paternoster SF', 'Meyer RG', 'Dewald GW']","['Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2003/12/31 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/12/31 05:00'],"['2003/12/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460803002024 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00202-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2004 Jan 1;148(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00202-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms of action of D609 against tumor cells have not been well established. Using U937 human monocytic leukemia cells, we examined the ability of D609 to inhibit sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), since inhibition of SMS may contribute to D609-induced tumor cell cytotoxicity via modulating the cellular levels of ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG). The results showed that D609 is capable of inducing U937 cell death by apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The induction of U937 cell apoptosis was associated with an inhibition of SMS activity and a significant increase in the intracellular level of ceramide and decrease in that of sphingomyelin (SM) and DAG, which resulted in an elevation of the ratio between ceramide and DAG favoring the induction of apoptosis. In addition, incubation of U937 cells with C(6)-ceramide and/or H7 (a selective PKC inhibitor) reduced U937 cell viability; whereas pretreatment of the cells with a PKC activator, PMA or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), attenuated D609-induced U937 cell apoptosis.

METHODS: Thirty-five children with AIN, 25 with acute leukaemia in remission, 10 of whom developed chemotherapy-associated neutropenia, and 28 non-neutropenic age-matched children were studied. The methods included haemopoietic progenitor cells' colony growth, replating of colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) of the 7th day and ELISA for the detection of serum levels of cytokines and adhesion molecules. RESULTS: In cases of severe autoimmune neutropenia, haemopoietic progenitors showed increased proliferative capacity compared to the control group (p = 0.03). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels inversely correlated with neutrophil counts (r = -0.8, p < 0.001 for ICAM-1, r = -0.5, p = 0.04 for E-selectin, r = -0.58, p = 0.01 for TNF-alpha, r = -0.62, p = 0.04 for IL-1beta). Serum ICAM-1, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels correlated positively with G-CSF levels (r = 0.47, p = 0.03 for ICAM-1, r = 0.65, p = 0.01 for TNF-alpha, r = 0.67, p = 0.04 for IL-1beta). Serum G-CSF levels were widely distributed and did not correlate with neutrophil counts (r = -0.44, p = 0.09). In secondary neutropenias the respective levels were lower than those in autoimmune neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Haemopoietic progenitors show increased proliferative capacity in cases of severe autoimmune neutropenia. G-CSF seems to act as an inducer of endothelium activation. The degree of neutropenia correlates with serum ICAM-1, E-selectin, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels, indicating the existence of an activated endothelium and presumably of a latent, low-grade, inflammatory process in severe autoimmune neutropenia.",,"['Perdikogianni, Ch', 'Dimitriou, H', 'Stiakaki, E', 'Markaki, E A', 'Kalmanti, M']","['Perdikogianni Ch', 'Dimitriou H', 'Stiakaki E', 'Markaki EA', 'Kalmanti M']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*blood', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'E-Selectin/blood', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/blood', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",2003/12/31 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2003/12/31 05:00'],"['2003/12/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/31 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08035250310005693 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2003 Nov;92(11):1277-83. doi: 10.1080/08035250310005693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 120 incident cases from 1978-97 were included in the study. Four controls per case, matched by age and gender, were sampled from population files. As index of exposure to traffic exhaust we estimated the annual mean concentration of benzene outside the home using a Gaussian diffusion model. This model uses traffic density (vehicles/day) on nearby main roads, distance between roads and residence, and information on vehicle emissions and weather conditions to estimate benzene concentration. Compared to children whose homes was not exposed to road traffic emissions (<0.1 microg/m(3) of benzene as estimated by the model), the risk of childhood leukemia was significantly higher (relative risk [RR] = 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36-11.27) for heavily exposed children (over 10 microg/m(3) estimated annual average). For the intermediate exposure group (0.1-10 microg/m(3)) the relative risk was 1.51 (95% CI = 0.91-2.51).

Here, previously characterized antigens associated with solid tumors (TAA) and newly characterized LAA were investigated for their expression in up to 60 AML patients and in leukemia cell lines. To investigate their specificity for leukemic blasts, the mRNA expression was also characterized in PBMN and CD34 positive cells of healthy volunteers and in a panel of normal tissues. The following antigens showed high mRNA expression in AML patients: MPP11 was detected in 43/50 (86%), RHAMM in 35/50 (70%), WT1 in 40/60 (67%), PRAME in 32/50 (64%), G250 in 18/35 (51%), hTERT in 7/25 (28%) and BAGE in 8/30 (27%) of AML patients. Real-time RT-PCR showed a tumor-specific expression of the antigens BAGE, G250 and hTERT, as well as highly tumor-restricted expression for RHAMM, PRAME and WT1. The antigen MPP11 was overexpressed.

METHODS: We reviewed paired blood films prepared from ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (ETDA) samples with and without bovine serum albumin (BSA) from 82 CLL patients. Group 1 adhered to NCCLS specifications for the preparations of EDTA blood films. Group 2 consisted of blood films containing EDTA and a 1:12 dilution of 22% BSA. Eight patients were selected for digital photomicroscopy and statistical analysis. Approximately 100 lymphocytes from each slide were digitally captured. RESULTS: The mean cell area +/- standard error was 127.8 microm(2) +/- 1.42 for (n = 793) for group 1 versus 100.7 microm(2) +/- 1.39 (n = 831) for group 2. The nuclear area was 88.9 microm(2) +/- 0.85 for group 1 versus 76.4 microm(2) +/- 0.83 for group 2. For the nuclear transmittance, the values were 97.6 +/- 0.85 for group 1 and 104.1 +/- 0.83 for group 2. The nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios were 0.71 +/- 0.003 for group 1 and 0.78 +/- 0.003 for group 2. All differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BSA addition results in the reduction of atypical lymphocytes and a decrease in smudge cells. BSA also decreases the lymphocyte area and nuclear area, whereas nuclear transmittance and nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio are increased. A standardized method of slide preparation would allow accurate interlaboratory comparison. The use of BSA may permit better implementation of the blood film-based subclassification of CLL and lead to a better correlation of morphology with cytogenetics and immunophenotyping.

We studied ATM gene involvement in leukemic cells derived from 39 pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). Two types of sequence changes--truncating and missense--were identified in 8 T-cell ALL samples: 3 truncating changes, all previously identified in A-T (R35X, -30del215, 2284delCT), and 3 missense variants (V410A, F582L, F1463C) were found, none associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In all patients studied, the mutation was present in the germ-line. A-T carriers, defined by the finding of truncating mutations, were found to be 12.9 times more frequent than in the normal population (P = 0.004). A normally ethnically matched population was screened for the 3 missense variants, and their frequency was significantly more prevalent (4.9-fold excess) than in the normal population (P = 0.03). Our data suggest there is some evidence of an association between missense alterations in the ATM gene and T-cell ALL. A significant difference in the mean age at diagnosis of T-cell ALL was noted between patients harboring an ATM sequence change and those with no change, 5.4 years and 9.7 years, respectively (P = 0.001). No ATM alterations were identified in relapse samples, indicating that ATM does not play a role in disease progression. The high prevalence of germ-line truncating and missense ATM gene alterations among children with sporadic T-cell ALL suggests an association with susceptibility to T-cell acute leukemia and supports the model of predisposition to cancer in A-T heterozygotes.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Liberzon, Ella', 'Avigad, Smadar', 'Stark, Batia', 'Zilberstein, Julia', 'Freedman, Laurence', 'Gorfine, Malka', 'Gavriel, Herzel', 'Cohen, Ian J', 'Goshen, Yacov', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Zaizov, Rina']","['Liberzon E', 'Avigad S', 'Stark B', 'Zilberstein J', 'Freedman L', 'Gorfine M', 'Gavriel H', 'Cohen IJ', 'Goshen Y', 'Yaniv I', 'Zaizov R']","['Molecular Oncology, Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/12/30 05:00,2004/02/19 05:00,['2003/12/30 05:00'],"['2003/12/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10306 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Feb;39(2):161-6. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to compare the immunogenotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) patterns of the unrearranged ETV6 allele of matched diagnosis/relapse samples from 12 children with an early or late relapse. We identified varying degrees of differences in the IG/TCR in six of them. A clonal change or evolution of the unrearranged ETV6 allele was also observed in six children but remained unchanged in three. However, these two parameters were not in concordance, nor did the immunogenotype pattern correlate with the duration of the first remission. We therefore propose that the potential of the immunogenotype to diversify depends primarily on the stage of IG/TCR gene configuration of the cell in which the ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion takes place.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Peham, Martina', 'Konrad, Marianne', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Konig, Margit', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E Renate']","['Peham M', 'Konrad M', 'Harbott J', 'Konig M', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2003/12/30 05:00,2004/02/19 05:00,['2003/12/30 05:00'],"['2003/12/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10305 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Feb;39(2):156-60. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the molecular analysis of a t(4;21)(q28;q22) that has disrupted AML1 in a patient with de novo T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By using 3'-RACE analysis, we show that this rearrangement results in the fusion of a novel gene immediately downstream of exon 5 or exon 6 of AML1, indicating that the AML1 breakpoint lies in intron 6 and that alternative fusion splice variants are generated. The sequence of the novel gene, located at 4q28, does not have any significant homology with any of the known genes in the human GenBank DNA database. However, the first 118 bases are identical to a part of a human ovarian EST. Also, its high homology with mouse and rat sequences suggests that this sequence most probably represents a part of a novel gene, which we named FGA7 (Fused Gene 7 to AML1). Following the AML1 open reading frame, the FGA7 sequence encodes an unknown protein of 27 amino acids. We isolated three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that contain the FGA7 sequence and confirmed the breakpoint of the gene on the patient's metaphase spreads by fluorescence in situ hybridization using these BACs as probes. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses revealed that FGA7 is expressed in ovarian and skeletal muscle tissues. The predicted AML1-FGA7 chimeric proteins contained a limited number of residues fused to AML1 in a situation similar to that reported for the AML1-EAP fusion that is a product of t(3;21).

However, its role in the development of preimplantation embryos remains controversial. In this study, changes in preimplantation embryos were determined after microinjection of LIF antisense oligonucleotide at the two-pronucleus stage. Although no significant differences were found in the percentages between the untreated group and the 0.25-fmol-treated group, the 0.5- or 1.0-fmol-treated groups had significantly lower percentages of embryos developed to the morula or blastocyst stage and the 2.0-fmol-treated group had significantly lower percentages of embryos developed to the four-cell, morula, or blastocyst stage. No embryos developed to the four-cell stage in the 4.0-fmol-treated group. Moreover, there was a decreasing trend in the levels of LIF immunoactivity with the increasing amount of LIF antisense oligonucleotide injected. The diameter of blastocysts in the 2.0-fmol-treated group was significantly smaller than that in the untreated group. The blastocysts in this group had significantly lower numbers of blastomeres and cells in the inner cell mass (ICM) or trophectoderm (TE) and ICM:TE ratio. The 1.0- or 2.0-fmol-treated groups had significantly lower implantation rates than their corresponding control groups. In the 2.0-fmol groups with supplementing exogenous LIF, significantly lower percentages were also observed in the four-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages. However, blastocysts treated with 50 ng/ml LIF had a significantly higher percentage than those in the LIF gene-impaired group without LIF supplement.

Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and Mcl-1 in 51 consecutive previously untreated CLL patients and 16 controls was determined by Western blotting. Only 37 patients were treated, all with chlorambucil and prednisone initially. Six patients achieved complete response (CR), 14 were non-responders (NR), and 17 had a partial response (PR), as defined by NCI criteria. There was considerable inter-patient variability in protein expression and overlap with healthy volunteers (P > 0.05). All patients with CR had low Mcl-1 levels compared to the PR + NR group (0.07 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.07, P = 0.043). Higher Mcl-1 expression as determined by dichotomizing the data was associated with a failure to achieve CR (P = 0.021). The Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly associated with treatment response only when CR and PR were considered together (0.89 +/- 0.53 [CR + PR] vs. 3.38 +/- 4.47 [NR], P = 0.0118).

Nucleotide sequences of the Ig V(H) genes from 172 B-CLL patients were analyzed. Previously described V(H) gene usage biases were noted. As with canonical SHM, mutations found in B-CLL were more frequent in RGYW hot spots (mutations in an RGYW motif = 44.1%; germ line frequency of RGYW motifs = 25.6%) and favored transitions over transversions (transition-transversion ratio = 1.29). Significantly, transition preference was also noted when only mutations in the wobble position of degenerate codons were considered. Wobble positions are inherently unselected since regardless of change an identical amino acid is encoded; therefore, they represent a window into the nucleotide bias of the mutational mechanism. B-CLL V(H) mutations concentrated in complementarity-determining region 1 (CDR1) and CDR2, which exhibited higher replacement-to-silent ratios (CDR R/S, 4.60; framework region [FR] R/S, 1.72).

Genes coding for core binding factors are rearranged in a considerable subset of AML cases and result in an altered interaction of core binding factor (CBF) subunits with transcriptional coregulators (NCoR/SMRT). Recruitment of histone deacetylase is also altered in AML, and a subsequent transcriptional repression of target genes involved in myeloid maturation is determined. We determined here the effects of two histone deacetylase inhibitors, sodium butyrate and the stable prodrug xylitol butyrate derivative (D1), on a t(8;21)-positive cell line (Kasumi-1) as well as primary AML blasts. Exposure (24-96 h) to butyrates (1 mM) of Kasumi-1 cells induced histone H4 acetylation, whereas H3 acetylation was unchanged. Induction of morphological and immunophenotypic granulocytic maturation (96 h), also confirmed by an increased expression of CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, was observed. Inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis via activation of caspase-9 was also observed. In primary AML blasts, butyrates (0.5 mM) increased histone H4 acetylation of 18 of 19 cases tested. Terminal granulocytic maturation was observed in all cases (5 of 5) characterized by chromosomal translocations involving CBF, whereas in non-CBF cases, maturation was incomplete (4 of 8) or absent (4 of 8).

Here we show that cephalostatin 1 induces a novel pathway of receptor-independent apoptosis that selectively uses Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with a low isoelectric point) as a mitochondrial signaling molecule. At nanomolar concentrations, cephalostatin 1 triggers dose- and time-dependent DNA fragmentation in leukemia Jurkat T cells. Apoptosis was found to be dependent on caspase activity because the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone blocks cephalostatin 1-mediated DNA fragmentation. The CD95 death receptor as well as other caspase-8-requiring death receptors were not involved because Jurkat T cells lacking the CD95 receptor or caspase-8 and control cells responded equally to cephalostatin 1. Although cephalostatin 1 affects mitochondria by dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential, neither cytochrome c nor apoptosis-inducing factor is released, as shown by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, cephalostatin 1 selectively triggers the mitochondrial release of the inhibitor of apoptosis antagonist Smac/DIABLO. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) delayed both Smac/DIABLO release and onset of apoptosis, suggesting that Smac/DIABLO is required for cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adults with refractory acute leukemias including lymphoblastic (ALL), myelogenous (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) received clofarabine from 4 mg/m(2) to 55 mg/m2/day for 5 days as a 1-h i.v. infusion. A total of 26 of the 32 patients were studied for pharmacological investigations. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was 40 mg/m2/day for 5 days. Plasma pharmacology studies done in 25 patients indicate a linear increase in the plasma clofarabine concentration with increasing doses. At 40 mg/m2 the median plasma clofarabine level was 1.5 micro M (range, 0.42-3.2 micro M; n = 7). Cellular pharmacokinetic studies done at the end of the first clofarabine infusion in 26 patients appeared dose proportional but showed a wide variation in the concentrations of clofarabine triphosphate. At the maximum tolerated dose, the concentration was a median 19 micro M (range, 3-52 micro M). In the majority of cases, more than 50% of the analog triphosphate was present at 24 h after infusion. Compared with clofarabine triphosphate concentration, the endogenous level of dATP was low, resulting in a favorable ratio of analog triphosphate:normal deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) for incorporation into DNA. In association with the accumulation of triphosphate, there was a decrease in DNA synthesis. At 40- and 55-mg/m2 doses, the inhibition of DNA synthesis was maintained to 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Clofarabine at the maximum tolerated dose was effective with regard to inhibition of DNA synthesis and decline in circulating leukemia blasts. Given the clinical activity of clofarabine in adult acute leukemias, it is of interest to conduct a detailed characterization of the cellular pharmacology of clofarabine triphosphate and its relationship to clinical responses.",,"['Gandhi, Varsha', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Bonate, Peter', 'Du, Min', 'Ayres, Mary', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Plunkett, William']","['Gandhi V', 'Kantarjian H', 'Faderl S', 'Bonate P', 'Du M', 'Ayres M', 'Rios MB', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Several instruments are available for measuring fatigue. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is one of the most frequently used health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments, and it includes a three-item fatigue subscale. Limited knowledge exists about the validity, performance and sensitivity of EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale as compared with a fatigue-specific instrument. The aim of the present study was to validate the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale (FA) against the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ). The FQ is frequently used and was developed to measure fatigue in both cancer and noncancer populations. The FQ measures physical (PF, seven items) and mental fatigue (MF, four items). The study population included two different cohorts: A) patients with advanced metastatic cancer included in a prospective randomized study of palliative radiotherapy (n = 238); B) patients with leukaemia and malignant lymphoma curatively treated with stem-cell transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy (n = 128). The analysis demonstrated that the FA correlated higher with the PF scale (r = 0.67-0.75) as compared with the MF scale (r = 0.49-0.61). The item scale correlations between FA items and the PF scale were consistently higher than between FA items and the MF scale. A factor analysis including all the items within the FA and the FQ identified two factors. All FA items loaded on a PF factor (0.70-0.85). A floor/ ceiling effect, indicating a high number of respondents with lowest, respectively, highest scores was observed more frequently in the FA as compared with the FQ. The PF discriminated better between diagnostic groups with different levels of fatigue than the FA did. In conclusion, the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale is measuring physical fatigue. A floor/ ceiling effect seems to appear for the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale. The validity of the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale is to be questioned for use in palliative care patients. In studies with fatigue as a defined end point, a domain-specific instrument should, therefore, be added.",,"['Knobel, Heidi', 'Loge, Jon Havard', 'Brenne, Elisabeth', 'Fayers, Peter', 'Hjermstad, Marianne Jensen', 'Kaasa, Stein']","['Knobel H', 'Loge JH', 'Brenne E', 'Fayers P', 'Hjermstad MJ', 'Kaasa S']","['Unit for Applied Clinical Research, Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7006 Trondheim, Norway.

METHODS: The DNA fragment of MF-1 was cloned and sequenced; the mRNA level of MF-1 gene were analysed in MF-sensitive cell lines(HL-60, L1210 and CHL) by Northern blot after these cells being treated with 0.1 mT and 0.8 mT MF for 20 minutes and 24 hours, respectively.

Because other members of the IL-6 family such as leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM) share gp130, the signal transduction subunit of their receptors, interpretation of the data without considering the expression of these cytokines and their specific receptor subunits could be misleading. The immunohistochemical pattern of the IL-6 family and their receptor subunits in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostatic carcinoma (PC) was investigated. In normal prostates, gp130 and OSMRalpha were detected exclusively in the stroma and LIFRbeta was very scarce. While IL-6 was scarcely immunolocalized to the basal cells of the epithelium, OSM was detected in the stroma and LIF in both the epithelium and the stroma. This suggests an autocrine role for this family of cytokines in the stroma of normal prostates. In BPH, gp130 and OSMRalpha were detected both in the epithelium and in the stroma, whereas LIFRbeta was localized only to the epithelium. IL-6 localized preferentially to the epithelium, OSM to the stroma, and LIF to both compartments. Therefore, in addition to the autocrine role in the stroma, IL-6 and OSM may play a paracrine role from the stroma to the epithelium in BPH. In PC, gp130 and OSMRalpha were detected both in the epithelium and in the stroma, increasing with rising Gleason grade, whereas LIFRbeta was localized exclusively to the epithelium of low Gleason grade carcinomas. IL-6, LIF, and OSM localized in all cell types, with immunostaining increasing with Gleason grade. These data suggest an autocrine role for these cytokines in the epithelial cells of PC. The distinct pattern of expression of LIFRbeta exclusively in low Gleason grade carcinomas makes LIFRbeta a candidate for malignancy diagnosis. The role of OSM mainly in high Gleason grade carcinomas makes OSM a putative target for prostate cancer therapy.","['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Royuela, Mar', 'Ricote, Monica', 'Parsons, Melanie S', 'Garcia-Tunon, Ignacio', 'Paniagua, Ricardo', 'de Miguel, Maria P']","['Royuela M', 'Ricote M', 'Parsons MS', 'Garcia-Tunon I', 'Paniagua R', 'de Miguel MP']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Interleukin-6/*analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Prostate/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*analysis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",2003/12/25 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/12/25 05:00'],"['2003/12/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1476 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2004 Jan;202(1):41-9. doi: 10.1002/path.1476.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that transepithelial migration would modulate PMNL apoptosis. METHOD: PMNLs that were freshly purified from normal volunteers were allowed to migrate across transwell membranes alone or coated with monolayers of human lung epithelial cells in response to chemoattractants (interleukin-8, formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine and leukotriene B(4)). We assessed for migration efficiency, apoptosis, and functional activity of the PMNLs. Changes in the expression of genes modulating PMNL apoptosis were examined with messenger RNA and protein analyses. RESULTS: Transepithelial migration caused a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic PMNLs (interleukin-8; from 31% to 16% at 8 hours; P<.01). This apoptotic delay was sustained to at least 20 hours that was associated with prolongation of PMNL functional activity and independent of chemoattractant-type. Gene and protein expression levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and 14-3-3 zeta were either augmented or preserved by interleukin-8 treatment alone and after transepithelial migration. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal, for the first time, the important role of transepithelial migration in the modulation of PMNL apoptosis and may provide insights into possible novel targets for the regulation of PMNL apoptosis during lung inflammation and injury.",,"['Hu, Maowen', 'Miller, Edmund J', 'Lin, Xinchun', 'Simms, H Hank']","['Hu M', 'Miller EJ', 'Lin X', 'Simms HH']","['Department of Surgery, North Shore University Hospital Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Boas-Marks Research Institute, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*physiology', 'Epithelium/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Lung/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism']",2003/12/25 05:00,2004/01/22 05:00,['2003/12/25 05:00'],"['2003/12/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/s0039-6060(03)00347-7 [doi]', 'S0039606003003477 [pii]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2004 Jan;135(1):87-98. doi: 10.1016/s0039-6060(03)00347-7.,,,"['GM 065555/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HLBI 55622/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three types of L domains have been identified to date: Pro-Thr-Ala-Pro (PTAP), Pro-Pro-X-Tyr, and Tyr-Pro-Asp-Leu. It has previously been demonstrated that overexpression of the N-terminal, E2-like domain of the endosomal sorting factor TSG101 (TSG-5') inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) release but does not affect the release of the PPPY-containing retrovirus murine leukemia virus (MLV), whereas overexpression of the C-terminal portion of TSG101 (TSG-3') potently disrupts both HIV-1 and MLV budding. In addition, it has been reported that, while the release of a number of retroviruses is disrupted by proteasome inhibitors, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) budding is not affected by these agents. In this study, we tested the ability of TSG-5', TSG-3', and full-length TSG101 (TSG-F) overexpression, a dominant negative form of the AAA ATPase Vps4, and proteasome inhibitors to disrupt the budding of EIAV particles bearing each of the three types of L domain. The results indicate that (i) inhibition by TSG-5' correlates with dependence on PTAP; (ii) the release of wild-type EIAV (EIAV/WT) is insensitive to TSG-3', whereas this C-terminal TSG101 fragment potently impairs the budding of EIAV when it is rendered PTAP or PPPY dependent; (iii) budding of all EIAV clones is blocked by dominant negative Vps4; and (iv) EIAV/WT release is not impaired by proteasome inhibitors, while EIAV/PTAP and EIAV/PPPY release is strongly disrupted by these compounds. These findings highlight intriguing similarities and differences in host factor utilization by retroviral L domains and suggest that the insensitivity of EIAV to proteasome inhibitors is conferred by the L domain itself and not by determinants in Gag outside the L domain.",,"['Shehu-Xhilaga, Miranda', 'Ablan, Sherimay', 'Demirov, Dimiter G', 'Chen, Chaoping', 'Montelaro, Ronald C', 'Freed, Eric O']","['Shehu-Xhilaga M', 'Ablan S', 'Demirov DG', 'Chen C', 'Montelaro RC', 'Freed EO']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/chemistry/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Transfection', 'Virion/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/12/25 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/12/25 05:00'],"['2003/12/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.2.724-732.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jan;78(2):724-32. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.2.724-732.2004.,,PMC368837,"['R01 CA049296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI049820/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '2R01 CA49296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI49820/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of PiT1 and PiT2 to function as discrete viral receptors with unique properties presumably is reflected in critical residue differences between these two proteins. Early efforts to map the region(s) within PiT2 that is important for virus binding and/or entry relied on infection results obtained with PiT1-PiT2 chimeric cDNAs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHOK1) cells. These attempts to localize the PiT2 virus-binding site were hampered because they were based on infectivity, not binding, assays, and therefore, receptors that bound but failed to facilitate virus entry could not be distinguished from receptors that did not bind virus.

Using this test it can be determined whether the global expression pattern of a group of genes is significantly related to some clinical outcome of interest. Groups of genes may be any size from a single gene to all genes on the chip (e.g. known pathways, specific areas of the genome or clusters from a cluster analysis). RESULT: The test allows groups of genes of different size to be compared, because the test gives one p-value for the group, not a p-value for each gene. Researchers can use the test to investigate hypotheses based on theory or past research or to mine gene ontology databases for interesting pathways. Multiple testing problems do not occur unless many groups are tested.

However, thromboembolism (TE) in children with ALL is most commonly reported after the initiation of antileukemic therapy indicating a possible interaction of the disease and therapy. Antileukemic therapy influences the haemostatic system either by direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents or indirectly through the effect of supportive care, e.g. central venous line (CVL) or infectious complications secondary to immunosuppression. Asparaginase and steroids are shown to induce hypercoagulable state by suppression of natural anticoagulants, especially AT and plasminogen, and by elevations in F VIII/vWF complex, respectively. In addition, steroid therapy causes hypofibrinolytic state by dose-dependent increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels. Combination of these effects coupled with increased thrombin generation may be responsible for the increased incidence of TE observed with concomitant administration of asparaginase and steroids.

The aim of this study was to investigate the modified FLAG regimen (Ara-C reduced to 200 mg per day intravenous injection for 5 to 7 days, and the patients were not administrated G-CSF before fludarabine and Ara-C) to examine whether it can achieve the same effectiveness and minor side effects. METHODS: Of 33 patients with acute leukemia, there were 16 cases with ANLL, 12 cases with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 5 cases with relapsed ALL, respectively. All patients received fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m(2)/d intravenous injection for 5 days. And every patient received simultaneously Flu in combination with Ara-C intravenously for 5-7 days, 18 cases with Ara-C at a dose of 200 mg per day, 5 cases with Ara-c 500 mg/d and 10 cases with Ara-c 1000 mg/d, respectively. One course consisted of 7 days. ALL patients and the patients received Ara-C at a dose of 200 mg per day were not treated with G-CSF before chemotherapy. ALL patients received vincristine at a dose of 2 mg/w for 2 times and prednisone 60-80 mg/d for 14 days. Of these 33 patients, the cases with white blood cell(WBC) counts less than 1.0 x 10(9)/L were treated with G-CSF at a dose of 300 microg/d subcutaneously until WBC counts were more than 3.0 x 10(9)/L.

RESULTS: The CR rate of 16 patients with refractory ANLL was 56.3%, whereas the CR rate of 12 cases with refractory ALL was 17% (P< 0.01). The CR rate of the patients with refractory ANLL who received Ara-C 200 mg/d was higher than those with refractory ANLL receiving Ara-C at the medial doses (70% versus 33%, P >0.05).

This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of single daily dose of 250 microg G-CSF (Lenograstim) for stem cell mobilization and hematopoietic reconstitution after allo-PBSCT. METHODS: The study included a group of 38 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies (acute leukemia:21 cases; chronic myelogenous leukemia:14 cases; myelodysplastic syndrome:3 cases) from January 2000 to June 2002. For the 38 sibling or matched unrelated donors G-CSF was administered at single daily dose of 250 microg despite of their body weight. Leukapheresis was performed on the fifth day. The patients were conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI)+cyclophosphamide or busulfan+cyclophosphamide. G-CSF support was given from the third day after stem cell reinfusion, usually until neutrophil recovery. RESULTS: The average dosage of G-CSF administrated was 4.8 microg x (kg x d)(-1). An average of 1.7 times of apheresis were performed. The median CD34(+) cell and CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell yield were 6.09 x 10(6)/kg and 1.33 x 10(6)/kg, respectively. The CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio of the leukapheresis products was 1.41+/-0.51,and (17.61+/-6.64)% of the leukapheresis products were CD3(-)/CD16(+)CD56(+) cells.

The purpose of this paper was to clarify the role of inducing acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) during transplantation in preventing relapse. METHODS: Thirty adult patients with refractory or relapsed leukemia were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=16), acute myelogenous leukemia (n=10), and acute mixed leukemia (n=4). They were in first complete remission (n=4), second complete remission (n=9), partly remission (n=12), and non-response (n=5) at the time of transplantation. Patients underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) from HLA-identical siblings (n=21), mismatched siblings donors (n=3), and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (n=5) or allo-PBSCT (n=1) from unrelated HLA matched donors. All patients received myeloablative regimens for eliminating residual leukemic cell. For aGVHD prophylaxis the patients with HLA-identical siblings donors received cyclosporine (CSA) alone, and the patients with mismatched siblings or unrelated donors received CSA, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and low-dose ATG. For inducing aGVHD after transplantation, patients were scheduled to be quickly reduced the maintenance dose of CSA at 20% to 30% off every week or treated with pre-emptive donor leukocyte infusion if there was no appearance of aGVHD at +30 days to 60 days after transplantation. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 18.1 months, there were 24/30 (80%) patients developed aGVHD (grade 3 or 4 had 4/30, 13.3%). There were 11/19 (57.9%) patients developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD), with 3/19 (15.8%) had extensive cGVHD. Eighteen patients are alive with disease-free survival (18/30, 60%) and 12 patients have died of relapse (5/28, 17.9%) and TRM (7/30, 23.3%).

With a growing number of partially or completely sequenced genomes, multiple alignment is playing an increasingly important role in these studies. In recent years, various tools for pair-wise and multiple genomic alignment have been proposed. Some of them are extremely fast, but often efficiency is achieved at the expense of sensitivity. One way of combining speed and sensitivity is to use an anchored-alignment approach. In a first step, a fast search program identifies a chain of strong local sequence similarities. In a second step, regions between these anchor points are aligned using a slower but more accurate method. RESULTS: Herein, we present CHAOS, a novel algorithm for rapid identification of chains of local pair-wise sequence similarities. Local alignments calculated by CHAOS are used as anchor points to improve the running time of DIALIGN, a slow but sensitive multiple-alignment tool. We show that this way, the running time of DIALIGN can be reduced by more than 95% for BAC-sized and longer sequences, without affecting the quality of the resulting alignments. We apply our approach to a set of five genomic sequences around the stem-cell-leukemia (SCL) gene and demonstrate that exons and small regulatory elements can be identified by our multiple-alignment procedure.

The blasts coexpressed TdT and CD34 and were negative for myeloperoxidase, CD117, CD68 and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase. For the first time immunohistochemical Pax-5/CD34 doublestainings are provided, which revealed the blasts in one case to coexpress Pax-5 and CD34. All the blasts were CD79a-positive and 20% were also CD10-positive. In the other case, 20% of the blasts were CD79a-positive, 30% coexpressed Pax-5 and CD34 by doublestaining, and showed a clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene.

The specificity and the predictive values of these markers have never been assessed. In this study, we aimed, to explore whether a specific pattern could predict for this translocation. Of 405 consecutive AML, 18 (4.4%) had the t(8;21). Patients with this cytogenetic abnormality showed higher frequency of CD34 (P = 0.003), HLA-DR (P = 0.03), Tdt (P = 0.02), CD19 (P < 0.0001), and CD56 (P < 0.0001) and lower CD33 (P = 0.0001). Taken singly, the sensitivity of these markers for AML with t(8;21) ranged between 39 and 100% with CD34+ having the highest and CD33- having the lowest and the positive predictive values (PPV) ranged between 5 and 21% with CD19+ having the highest and HLA-DR+ having the lowest. When combinations of different markers were analyzed by multivariate analysis, the pattern CD34+/HLA-DR+/MPO+ was found to have the highest sensitivity (100%) with a PPV of 14% and the pattern CD34+/CD19+/CD56+ had the highest PPV (100%) with a sensitivity of 67%. We conclude that AML with t(8;21) is better identified by a combination of markers than by a single antigen pattern, the absence of CD34+, HLA-DR+ or MPO+ would preclude and the expression of the pattern CD34+/CD19+/CD56+ is highly predictive and could serve as a screening criteria for the t(8;21).",,"['Khoury, Haytham', 'Dalal, Bakul I', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Horsman, Douglas E', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Shepherd, John D', 'Toze, Cindy L', 'Conneally, Ebhilin A', 'Sutherland, Heather J', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Nantel, Stephen H']","['Khoury H', 'Dalal BI', 'Nevill TJ', 'Horsman DE', 'Barnett MJ', 'Shepherd JD', 'Toze CL', 'Conneally EA', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Hogge DE', 'Nantel SH']","['Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. khaytham@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2003/12/25 05:00,2004/06/23 05:00,['2003/12/25 05:00'],"['2003/12/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000116698 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Oct;44(10):1713-8. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000116698.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their cytolytic function is regulated by surface receptors that either inhibit or increase the NK-mediated cytotoxicity. Under physiological conditions, NK cells recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class I molecules through surface receptors delivering signals that inhibit NK cells function. Nonetheless, the ""missing self hypothesis"", i.e. the release of an inhibitory signal by the interaction between HLA I-specific inhibitory receptors and their ligands, is not sufficient to entirely explain the regulation of NK cytotoxicity. Activating and co-receptors also play a central role in NK cell activation. In the haematology field, several lines of evidence suggest that NKs participate to the anti-leukaemia immune response: (1) leukaemic cells have down-regulated HLA-class I molecule expression and putative allele loss, (2) several reports have indicated an inverse relationship between NK cell number or activity and prognosis in acute leukaemia, (3) NK-cell activity dependent immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with an increased frequency of lymphoid haematological malignancies, (4) recent data support a role for NK cells in the graft-versus-leukaemia effect observed in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. All these data raise several questions. How NK cells kill leukaemic targets, and how can leukaemia escape from innate immunity surveillance? What are the therapeutic possibilities to manipulate NK receptor-ligand interaction in order to increase leukaemia cell destruction?

The respiratory adverse effects include dyspnea, tachypnea, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, and hypoxemia. Stridor has not been previously reported with the use of amphotericin B. OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanism of action and reports of respiratory adverse effects for amphotericin B, the liposomal preparations of amphotericin B, and the differential diagnosis of stridor. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2002 was performed to review the current literature for possible mechanisms and immunoregulatory effects related to the infusion of amphotericin B. RESULTS: Amphotericin B has been shown to increase tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations in macrophages. In addition, it induces prostaglandin E2 synthesis and increases the production of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in mononuclear cells. The immunoregulatory effects of amphotericin B include increases in apoptosis, production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B induces the production of TNF-alpha, interferon-gamma, and IL-1beta, which may potentiate its toxic effects.

Recent pathogenetic investigations have demonstrated that this clinical phenotype includes also autosomal dominant and sporadic cases with different point mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene in a subgroup of patients. Data on over 400 patients with CN collected by the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry demonstrate that independent from the CN-subtype more than 90% of these patients respond to recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF filgrastim, lenograstim) with ANC that can be maintained around 1.0 x 10(9)/L. Adverse events include mild splenomegaly, moderate thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis and malignant transformation into myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia. Development of additional genetic aberrations, e.g., G-CSF-receptor gene mutations, monosomy 7 or ras mutations during the course of the disease indicate an underlying genetic instability leading to an increased risk of malignant transformation.

However, the significance of lower respiratory tract cultures that are positive for these saprophytic molds in an unselected population of patients with cancer remains unclear. METHODS: The authors evaluated the significance of respiratory specimens positive for saprophytic molds in patients with cancer using the criteria set by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group (MSG). They included the diagnostic category of indeterminate pulmonary invasive mold infection (IMI) for cases that met the criteria for probable IMI but had other pathogens concomitantly isolated from the respiratory tract. RESULTS: Eighty-five cases with at least 1 positive culture were identified in 79 patients. Two cases were proven IMI, 29 were indeterminate IMI, 5 were possible IMI, and 49 were no IMI. All 38 cases from patients with solid tumors represented colonization compared with only 11 of the 47 cases (23%) from high-risk patients (P < 0.0001). The positive predictive value (PPV) of cultures was 0% in patients with solid tumors and ranged from 4.3% to 76.6%, depending on the analytic model used, in high-risk patients with leukemia and recipients of BMT. Cultures positive for Scedosporium spp. had a higher PPV (9.1-100%) than did cultures positive for non- Scedosporium spp. (2.8- 69.4%).

During therapy with imatinib, up to 45% of patients with CML reportedly experience myelosuppression > or = Grade 3, requiring interruption of therapy and/or dose reductions. The significance of myelosuppression for response to imatinib is unknown. METHODS: The authors analyzed 143 patients with late chronic-phase CML who were treated with imatinib after failing interferon. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine patient characteristics that were correlated with myelosuppression response and the association between myelosuppression and cytogenetic response. RESULTS: Neutropenia > or = Grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) occurred in 64 patients (45%), and thrombocytopenia > or = Grade 3 occurred in 31 patients (22%). Any myelosuppression > or = Grade 3 was associated with a lower rate of major (P = 0.04) or complete (P = 0.01) cytogenetic responses. This was more pronounced with myelosuppression that lasted > 2 weeks. The major cytogenetic response rate was 58% with Grade > or = 3 myelosuppression compared with a rate of 75% without Grade > or =3 myelosuppression (P = 0.03); the complete cytogenetic response rates were 36% and 63%, respectively (P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, pretreatment platelet count, imatinib dose reductions, and duration of myelosuppression were associated significantly with response.

In this study, aberrant methylation in the SHP1 gene promoter was detected in many B-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines as well as in patient specimens, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (methylation frequency 93%), MALT lymphoma (82%), mantle cell lymphoma (75%), plasmacytoma (100%) and follicular lymphoma (96%) by methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing, and restriction enzyme-mediated PCR analyses. The methylation frequency was significantly higher in high-grade MALT lymphoma cases (100%) than in low-grade MALT lymphoma cases (70%), which correlated well with the frequency of no expression of SHP1 protein in high-grade (80%) and low-grade MALT lymphoma (54%). It suggests that the SHP1 gene silencing with aberrant CpG methylation relates to the lymphoma progression. SHP1 protein expression was recovered in B-cell lines after the treatment of the demethylating reagent: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Transfection of the intact SHP1 gene to the hematopoietic cultured cells, which show no expression of the SHP1 gene, induced growth inhibition, indicating that gene silencing of the SHP1 gene by aberrant methylation plays an important role to get the growth advantage of the malignant lymphoma/leukemia cells. The extraordinarily high frequency (75 to 100%) of CpG methylation of the SHP1 gene in B-cell lymphoma/leukemia patient specimens indicates that the SHP1 gene silencing is one of the critical events to the onset of malignant lymphomas/leukemias as well as important implications for the diagnostic or prognostic markers and the target of gene therapy.

METHODS: Vital status was updated through 1998, and life table analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Mortality from all causes and all cancers was less than expected based on US mortality rates. A statistically significant increase in non-malignant respiratory disease mortality and non-significant increases in mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies other than leukaemia, lung cancer, and chronic renal disease were observed. The excess in lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer mortality was due to an increase in mortality from lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma and Hodgkin's disease. Within the category of non-malignant respiratory disease, mortality from emphysema and pneumoconioses and other respiratory disease was increased. Mortality from lung cancer and emphysema was higher among workers hired prior to 1955 when exposures to uranium, silica, and vanadium were presumably higher. Mortality from these causes of death did not increase with employment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Although the observed excesses were consistent with our a priori hypotheses, positive trends with employment duration were not observed. Limitations included the small cohort size and limited power to detect a moderately increased risk for some outcomes of interest, the inability to estimate individual exposures, and the lack of smoking data. Because of these limitations, firm conclusions about the relation of the observed excesses in mortality and mill exposures are not possible.",,"['Pinkerton, L E', 'Bloom, T F', 'Hein, M J', 'Ward, E M']","['Pinkerton LE', 'Bloom TF', 'Hein MJ', 'Ward EM']","['The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, Industrywide Studies Branch, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, USA.

There was no overall excess of haematopoietic cancers combined or of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, internal exposure-response analyses found positive trends for haematopoietic cancers which were limited to males (15 year lag). The trend in haematopoietic cancer was driven by lymphoid tumours (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma, lymphocytic leukaemia), which also have a positive trend with cumulative exposure for males with a 15 year lag. Haematopoietic cancer trends were somewhat weaker in this analysis than trends in the earlier follow up, and analyses restricted to the post-1987 data did not show any significant positive trends (exposure levels dropped sharply in the early 1980s). Breast cancer did not show any overall excess, although there was an excess in the highest cumulative exposure quartile using a 20 year lag. Internal exposure-response analyses found positive trend for breast cancer using the log of cumulative exposure with a 20 year lag. CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence of any excess cancer mortality for the cohort as a whole, with the exception of bone cancer based on small numbers.

Its effects have not been evaluated in a large patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 1,789 patients with acute leukemia receiving BMT and 434 patients receiving peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSCs) from HLA-identical siblings from 1992 to 2002 and reported the findings to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Among the BMT and PBSC patients, 501 (28%) and 175 (40%), respectively, were treated with G-CSF during the first 14 days after the transplantation. The outcome variables were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: BMT and PBSC patients treated with G-CSF had a faster engraftment of absolute neutrophils greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L (P <.01), but platelet engraftment ( > 50 x 10(9)/L) was slower (P <.001). In the BMT patients, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV was 50% +/- 5% (+/- 95% CI) in the G-CSF group versus 39% +/- 3% in the controls (relative risk [RR], 1.33; P =.007, in the multivariate analysis). The incidence of chronic GVHD was also increased (RR, 1.29; P =.03). G-CSF was associated with an increase in transplantation-related mortality (TRM; RR, 1.73; P =.00016) and had no effect on relapse but reduced survival (RR, 0.59; P <.0001) and leukemia-free survival rates (LFS; RR, 0.64; P =.0003). No such effects of G-CSF were seen in patients receiving PBSC. CONCLUSION: After BMT, platelet engraftment was delayed, and GVHD and TRM were increased. Survival and LFS were reduced. This suggests that G-CSF should not be given shortly after BMT.",,"['Ringden, Olle', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Le Blanc, Katarina', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Reiffers, Jules', 'Arcese, William', 'Vossen, Jaak M', 'Jouet, Jean-Pierre', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Frassoni, Francesco']","['Ringden O', 'Labopin M', 'Gorin NC', 'Le Blanc K', 'Rocha V', 'Gluckman E', 'Reiffers J', 'Arcese W', 'Vossen JM', 'Jouet JP', 'Cordonnier C', 'Frassoni F']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Clinical Immunology F79, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of As2O3 on repolarizing cardiac ion currents. METHODS AND RESULTS: In HERG- or KCNQ1+KCNE1-transfected CHO cells (n=32; total), As2O3 caused concentration-dependent block of both IKr and IKs, with an IC50 for tail current block of 0.14+/-0.01 micromol/L for IKr and 1.13+/-0.06 micromol/L for IKs. In contrast to other QT-prolonging drugs, As2O3 also activated a time-independent current that additional experiments identified as IK-ATP. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 blocks both IKr and IKs at clinically relevant concentrations. On the other hand, it also activates IK-ATP, which maintains normal repolarization. We infer that variability in the extent of QT interval prolongation and onset of ventricular arrhythmias during arsenic therapy represents competing effects to block and activate multiple repolarizing potassium currents.",,"['Drolet, Benoit', 'Simard, Chantale', 'Roden, Dan M']","['Drolet B', 'Simard C', 'Roden DM']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, 532 Robinson Research Building, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tenn 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)', '0 (potassium channel protein I(sk))', '7B0ZZH8P2W (Pinacidil)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SX6K58TVWC (Glyburide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Glyburide/pharmacology', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Pinacidil/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/*drug effects', 'Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying/drug effects', 'Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated/drug effects']",2003/12/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2003/12/24 05:00'],"['2003/12/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2003/12/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1161/01.CIR.0000109484.00668.CE [doi]', '01.CIR.0000109484.00668.CE [pii]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2004 Jan 6;109(1):26-9. doi: 10.1161/01.CIR.0000109484.00668.CE.

The mRNAs of cyclin B1, p21 cip1 and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in patients and NCs were measured with semi-quantity reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Cyclin B1 protein expression in de novo AL patients was significantly higher than that in NC (P < 0.001).

In the present study, we determine whether over-expression in rat islets of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1c (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c) affects insulin release, and whether changes in islet lipid content may be reversed by activation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). Infection with an adenovirus encoding the constitutively active nuclear fragment of SREBP1c resulted in expression of the protein in approx. 20% of islet cell nuclei, with a preference for beta-cells at the islet periphery. Real-time PCR (TaqMan) analysis showed that SREBP1c up-regulated the expression of FAS (fatty acid synthase; 6-fold), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (2-fold), as well as peroxisomal-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (7-fold), uncoupling protein-2 (1.4-fold) and Bcl2 (B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2; 1.3-fold). By contrast, levels of pre-proinsulin, pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1, glucokinase and GLUT2 (glucose transporter isoform-2) mRNAs were unaltered. SREBP1c-transduced islets displayed a 3-fold increase in triacylglycerol content, decreased glucose oxidation and ATP levels, and a profound inhibition of glucose-, but not depolarisation-, induced insulin secretion. Culture of islets with the AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside decreased the expression of the endogenous SREBP1c and FAS genes, and reversed the effect of over-expressing active SREBP1c on FAS mRNA levels and cellular triacylglycerol content. We conclude that SREBP1c over-expression, even when confined to a subset of beta-cells, leads to defective insulin secretion from islets and may contribute to some forms of Type II diabetes.",,"['Diraison, Frederique', 'Parton, Laura', 'Ferre, Pascal', 'Foufelle, Fabienne', 'Briscoe, Celia P', 'Leclerc, Isabelle', 'Rutter, Guy A']","['Diraison F', 'Parton L', 'Ferre P', 'Foufelle F', 'Briscoe CP', 'Leclerc I', 'Rutter GA']","['Henry Wellcome Signalling Laboratories and Department of Biochemistry, School of Medical Sciences, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Srebf1 protein, rat)', '0 (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (aminoglycoside N1-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acid Synthases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glucose/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lipids/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Ribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Triglycerides/metabolism']",2003/12/24 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/12/24 05:00'],"['2003/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2003/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20031277 [doi]', 'BJ20031277 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Mar 15;378(Pt 3):769-78. doi: 10.1042/BJ20031277.,,PMC1224038,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, its antimyeloma effect was discovered. The aim of the work was to evaluate the incidence of adverse reactions to thalidomide. Its therapeutic effect has not been assessed because of a short period of monitoring and diversity of a sample. The assessed sample consisted of 17 patients with diagnosis of multiple myeloma (10 men and 7 women). An average age of patients was 62.9 +/- 9.4. An average time elapsed from making the diagnosis to starting the treatment with thalidomide was 51.0 +/- 23.7 months. An average length of therapy was 20.1 +/- 9.6 weeks. An average daily maximum therapeutic dose was 138.3 +/- 83.2 mg. Data were collected from outpatient physicians reports, regular laboratory tests, and direct interviews with patients. To classify severity of adverse drug effects (grades 0-4) we used WHO criteria, Cancer and Leukemia Group B criteria, and in cases where certain adverse effects were not included in the above mentioned criteria, we defined our own criteria.

AgNORs are loops of DNA, correlated with proliferative potential of cells. Alteration in p53 and bcl-2 proteins expression may characterize the malignant potential of leukemic cells. The patients were subdivided according to the p53 positivity and negativity. The frequency of p53-positive patients was relatively low in T-ALL (29%) and B-CLL (16%). B-ALL, AML and CML patients revealed higher frequency of p53 protein (46%, 47% and 88%, respectively). The overall frequency of positive cytoplasmic staining for bcl-2 protein was demonstrated in the majority of patients. No significant differences in the percentage of p53-positive cells among leukemia subtypes were seen. The proportion of bcl-2 protein positive cells did not differ significantly among various leukemia subtypes, except for significant differences between p53-positive and p53-negative peripheral blood (p=0.0073) and bone marrow (p=0.0175) cells of B-CLL patients. The samples from healthy subjects used as controls exhibited relatively low numbers of AgNOR dots in both, peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. Highly significant differences in AgNOR quantities between healthy donors and p53 protein positive peripheral blood as well as bone marrow cells of distinct leukemia subtypes (except for bone marrow cells in B-CLL patients, p=0.1727) were observed. Significant differences in AgNOR count between p53 protein positive and p53 protein negative samples of peripheral blood cells of B-ALL (p=0.0099) as well as B-CLL (p=0.0117) cases were found. No significant differences (except for B-CLL, p=0.0558) were encountered in bone marrow cells. P53 protein positivity or negativity did not influence the amount of AgNOR proteins in cells of our T-ALL and AML cases. Mutual comparing the number of AgNOR dots among different leukemias showed that for both peripheral blood and bone marrow cells the differences between ALL and AML (p=0.0383 and p=0.0033, respectively) as well as for peripheral blood of AML and CML (p=0.0302) were statistically significant. The bcl-2 protein positivity did not affect significantly the AgNOR distribution either in p53 protein positive or p53-negative cases of our leukemia patients. However, an association between the lowest AgNOR quantity and highest bcl-2 protein expression in p53-negative B-CLL patients was seen for both peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. The correlation between relatively high AgNOR numbers and relatively increased percentage of bcl-2 protein in the p53-positive cases of CML patients was found in some cases. Regarding the age and sex, the AgNOR distribution in p53-positive and p53-negative leukemia cases in children and adults showed neither relationship nor dependence. The WBC count differed evidently among distinct leukemia subtypes, with enormous heterogeneity in range as well.

The 196R allele is reportedly associated with an increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease, and donor 196R allele carriage correlates with increased severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after matched unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT). METHODS: We investigated the impact of donor and recipient TNFRII genotype on GVHD incidence and severity among 104 adult recipients of myeloablative sibling BMTs. RESULTS: 196R allele frequency was 0.28 among recipients, donors, and controls. There was an increased incidence of acute GVHD among 196R-positive recipients (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, P=0.05). This association was confirmed in multivariate analysis (relative risk 4, P=0.04), correcting for previously established clinical and genetic risk factors. Donor 196R homozygosity was associated with an increased incidence of extensive chronic GVHD (OR 18.5, P=0.02). This association was also confirmed in multivariate analysis (OR 11, P=0.02). To investigate the functional impact of the TNFRII 196 M/R polymorphism, 79 volunteer blood donors were genotyped at this locus, by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, and plasma soluble TNFRII (sTNFRII) levels were measured by ELISA. Mean plasma sTNFRII levels (pg/mL: +/-SEM) were 1224 (+/-26) and 1063 (+/-65) for 196M-postive (196 M homozygous or heterozygous) individuals and 196R homozygotes, respectively (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Because sTNFRIIs can act as TNF antagonists, the association between recipient and donor TNFRII 196R allele status and acute or extensive chronic GVHD incidence, respectively, may reflect reduced circulating sTNFRII.",,"['Stark, Gail L', 'Dickinson, Anne M', 'Jackson, Graham H', 'Taylor, Penelope R', 'Proctor, Stephen J', 'Middleton, Peter G']","['Stark GL', 'Dickinson AM', 'Jackson GH', 'Taylor PR', 'Proctor SJ', 'Middleton PG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, University of Newcastle, Queen Victoria Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, United Kingdom. g.l.stark@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*blood/*genetics', 'Bone Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/classification/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*blood/*genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Reference Values', 'Siblings', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/12/23 05:00,2004/01/22 05:00,['2003/12/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.TP.0000092496.05951.D5 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Dec 27;76(12):1742-9. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000092496.05951.D5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, mice with decreased NK cell function are more susceptible to carcinogen-induced cancers. Current evidence strongly suggests that downregulation of MHC by certain tumors and virally-infected cells results in NK cell attack due to the inability to trigger inhibitory Ly49, KIR, and NKG2A/CD94 class Ia and Ib MHC receptors. Extreme haplotype diversity is present in both mouse and human chromosomal segments coding for NK cell class Ia MHC receptors resulting in different numbers and types of receptors being expressed in individuals and different inbred mouse strains. Whether the absence or presence of a particular NK cell receptor gene is advantageous or deleterious for an individual with respect to immunity to pathogens and cancer is a question of paramount importance. Recent advances in our understanding of NK cell function are due to the identification of activating NK cell receptors, such as Ly49H and NKG2D, for specific viral and tumor ligands (m157 and Rae1, respectively).

We identified a new CML66 short isoform, termed CML66-S. The previously identified long CML66 is referred to as CML66-L. CML66-S shares the C terminus with CML66-L but has its unique N terminus. CML66-S is predominantly expressed in testis, but is also expressed in very low levels in tumor cells, whereas CML66-L is expressed in tumor cells and testis. Differential expression of CML66-L and CML66-S in tumor cells resulted from regulation at transcription, although alternative splicing also participated in the generation of the isoforms. In addition, Ab titers to a CML66-L peptide were significantly higher than that to CML66-S peptide in the sera from patients with tumors. Finally, the Abs to full-length CML66-L in the sera from patients with tumors were correlated with the Abs in the sera from these patients to CML66-L-38, which is a fusion protein with a CML66-L-specific N terminus. This suggests that the CML66-L isoform is mainly responsible for the epitope generation.

The risk of relapse was prognosticated less precisely by the Perugia donor-recipient KIR ligand-ligand mismatch model or by a natural cytotoxicity model. In contrast to the ligand-ligand model, we found that the new receptor-ligand model was accurate when analysis was applied to patients with lymphoid malignancy. These findings corroborate our observations that the recipient's KIR repertoire, which was derived from highly purified, HLA-disparate CD34+ cells, resumed a donor-specific pattern within 3 mo of transplantation, but did not correlate evidently with the donor or recipient ligand repertoire. In an in vitro assay and an in vivo mouse model, human NK cell cytotoxicity toward human leukemia cells with 11q23 chromosomal rearrangement increased with the number of receptor-ligand mismatch pairs or prestimulation with IL-12 and IL-18.

We show here that a redox-active site in TRX is essential for its release from T lymphocytes in response to H2O2 and extracellular TRX regulates its own H2O2-induced release. Human T cell leukemia virus type I-transformed T lymphocytes constitutively release a large amount of TRX. The level of TRX release is augmented upon the addition of H2O2, but suppressed upon the addition of N-acetylcysteine. In the culture supernatant of a Jurkat transfectant expressing the tagged TRX-wild type (WT), the tagged TRX protein is rapidly released at 1 h and kept at a constant level until 6 h after the addition of H2O2. In contrast, another type of transfectant expressing the tagged TRX mutant (C32S/C35S; CS) fails to release the protein. H2O2-induced release of TRX from the transfectant is inhibited by the presence of rTRX-WT in a dose-dependent manner. Preincubation of the transfectant with rTRX-WT for 1 h at 37 degrees C, but not 0 degrees C, results in a significant suppression of the TRX release, reactive oxygen species, and caspase-3 activity induced by H2O2, respectively. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis show that extracellular rTRX-WT added to the culture does not obviously enter T lymphocytes until 24 h. These results collectively suggest that the oxidative stress-induced TRX release from T lymphocytes depends on a redox-sensitive event and may be regulated by negative feedback loops using reactive oxygen species-mediated signal transductions.",,"['Kondo, Norihiko', 'Ishii, Yasuyuki', 'Kwon, Yong-Won', 'Tanito, Masaki', 'Horita, Hiroyuki', 'Nishinaka, Yumiko', 'Nakamura, Hajime', 'Yodoi, Junji']","['Kondo N', 'Ishii Y', 'Kwon YW', 'Tanito M', 'Horita H', 'Nishinaka Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Binding Sites/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Extracellular Fluid/metabolism/physiology', 'Feedback, Physiological/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2003/12/23 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2003/12/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.172.1.442 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Jan 1;172(1):442-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.1.442.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recurrent miscarriage has also been associated with the abnormal expression of various molecules by endometrial cells. The aim of this study was to determine if any of these molecules or cells could be used to distinguish LPD from in-phase endometrium. METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was used to compare endometrial expression of CD45+, CD56+, CD3+ and CD4+ cells, leukaemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-6 and estrogen and progesterone receptors in precisely timed endometrial biopsies obtained between days LH+6 and LH+11 from recurrent miscarriage women with in-phase and retarded endometrium. RESULTS: In all samples there was a positive correlation between the number of CD45+ cells and LH day and a negative correlation between progesterone receptor and LIF expression and LH day. A significantly lower number (P<0.05) of CD56+ cells in peri-implantation endometrium and a decreased mid-cycle estrogen level (P<0.05) was seen in women with LPD compared to in-phase endometrium when single analysis was carried out. However, these differences were not significant after application of the Bonferroni correction for multiple analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results are in line with previous associations observed between estrogen levels and LPD and suggest that the number of CD56+ cells is different in LPD and in-phase endometrium, although this could be due to delayed endometrial development in women with LPD.

The presence of N- and K-ras mutations was analysed by amplification and synthetic oligonucleotide probes and by the so-called polymerase chain reaction amplification for specific alleles technique. A total of 34 (30.6%) patients were found to harbour ras mutations in N-ras and/or K-ras. Fourteen patients (12.6%) had a single ras mutation and 20 patients (18%) had two ras mutations. A positive association between a priori at risk jobs and ras mutations was found, based on nine exposed cases; the odds ratio, adjusted by age, sex and previous X-ray and/or chemotherapy was 2.8 (95% confidence intervals: 0.9-9.0). When considering only subjects with two ras mutations the odds ratio was 4.8 (95% confidence intervals: 1.2-18.8). The odds ratio for a previous X-ray and/or chemotherapy was 16.2 (95% confidence intervals: 1.8-755.9); when only subjects with two ras mutations were considered, the odds ratio was 26.1 (95% confidence intervals: 2.5-1248.9). In conclusion, our data suggest that ras oncogene mutations might identify a group of leukaemia in people with previous X-ray/chemotherapy or with exposure to chemical agents in the work environment.",,"['Barletta, Emanuela', 'Gorini, Giuseppe', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Davico, Laura', 'Mugnai, Gabriele', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Leoni, Franco', 'Bertini, Marilena', 'Matullo, Giuseppe', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori']","['Barletta E', 'Gorini G', 'Vineis P', 'Miligi L', 'Davico L', 'Mugnai G', 'Ciolli S', 'Leoni F', 'Bertini M', 'Matullo G', 'Costantini AS']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['0 (Solvents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', '*Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Solvents/*adverse effects']",2003/12/23 05:00,2004/06/15 05:00,['2003/12/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgh057 [doi]', 'bgh057 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2004 May;25(5):749-55. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgh057.

Several experimental studies indicate that apoptotic bodies are an optimal source of tumor antigens for ex vivo priming of DC. However, the clinical use of killed tumor cells as a source of antigens will require an optimal methodology to induce effective tumor cell apoptosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: The goal of this study was to compare the efficiency of three agents for inducing neoplastic B lymphocyte apoptosis; staurosporine, infection by modified vaccinia (MVA) viral particles and ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation. RESULTS: The three methods were finely tuned to induce apoptosis in more than 90% of tumor cells after 24 hours of exposure. However, the viability of monocyte-derived DC, loaded with B-cell tumor apoptotic bodies induced by staurosporine or MVA viral particles, decreased dramatically within 48 hours after phagocytosis of the killed neoplastic cells. The persistence of the apoptosis-inducing agents in the apoptotic bodies and not in the tumor supernatant, was responsible for the observed damage to DC viability. In contrast, DC viability was not affected after uptake of tumor cells killed through UVC-irradiation. Furthermore, B-lymphoblastic cell line (LCL)-specific T cells were reactivated by DC loaded with apoptotic bodies induced by UVC-rays. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Since the method used to induce tumor cell apoptosis might be detrimental to DC viability, these findings should be considered when designing anticancer vaccination programs.",,"['Di Nicola, Massimo', 'Napoli, Sara', 'Anichini, Andrea', 'Mortarini, Roberta', 'Romagnoli, Luca', 'Magni, Michele', 'Matteucci, Paola', 'Baldassarri, Paola', 'Bersani, Ilaria', 'Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Gianni, Alessandro M']","['Di Nicola M', 'Napoli S', 'Anichini A', 'Mortarini R', 'Romagnoli L', 'Magni M', 'Matteucci P', 'Baldassarri P', 'Bersani I', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Gianni AM']","['C.

A randomized study was designed to evaluate whether the addition of IFN-alpha to a first-line treatment with fludarabine and prednisone could increase the response rate in patients with advanced CLL and whether IFN-alpha given as maintenance therapy could improve the duration of response. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-three patients were randomized to receive fludarabine (25 mg/m2/i.v., days 9-13) and prednisone (20 mg/m2, days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 and 40 mg/m2, days 9-13) (arm A: 66 patients) or in addition to the same schedule, IFN-alpha (2 MUI/sc, days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15) (arm B: 67 patients). Seventy-eight patients responsive to therapy entered the post-remission phase of the study in which 41 patients were randomized to receive IFN-alpha (3 MUI three times a week) and 37 to clinical observation. RESULTS: A similar response rate (complete responses + partial responses) was observed in the 2 arms: 86% for arm A and 84% for arm B (p = 0.4). A longer response duration was observed in patients who achieved a complete response (p = 0.001) and in patients who received maintenance therapy with IFN-alpha (p < 0.05). However, the quality of response was the only significant and independent factor influencing response duration (p < 0.01). No benefits in terms of infection-related mortality and morbidity could be ascribed to IFN-alpha administration. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In previously untreated CLL patients with advanced disease a high response rate is obtained from first-line fludarabine and prednisone and no benefit is derived from the addition of IFN-alpha to this regimen.

Such mutations and additional mutations causing progression of the disease are largely unknown. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a CMD characterized by a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 creating the fusion protein BCR-ABL. This translocation has also been suggested to cause mis-expression of the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 in hematopoietic cells. We have previously shown that Lhx2 expression in mouse HSC generates cytokine-dependent stem cell-like cell lines that can produce long-term repopulation in stem cell-deficient mice. DESIGN AND METHODS: Since the consequences of Lhx2 expression in hematopoietic cells in vivo were unknown, mice engrafted with the stem cell-like cell lines were analyzed in detail for any pathologic changes. RESULTS: Expression of Lhx2 was maintained in vivo and most engrafted mice developed a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis and anemia. The disorder was transplantable and the Lhx2-expressing cells could also cause acute leukemia. The anemia was due to both a reduced number of circulating erythrocytes and a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that constitutive expression of Lhx2 in hematopoietic cells causes CMD, and also that a novel cell-autonomous mechanism can contribute to anemia.",,"['Richter, Karin', 'Pinto do O, Perpetua', 'Hagglund, Anna-Carin', 'Wahlin, Anders', 'Carlsson, Leif']","['Richter K', 'Pinto do O P', 'Hagglund AC', 'Wahlin A', 'Carlsson L']","['Umea Center for Molecular Medicine, Umea University, 901 87 Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lhx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 5.3.1.9 (Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase)']",IM,"['Anemia/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2003/12/23 05:00,2006/04/07 09:00,['2003/12/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Dec;88(12):1336-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APRT is a valid target for development of inhibitors as anticancer drugs. We have developed a thin layer chromatographic assay for PRPP extracted from cells. Using coupling enzymes, PRPP with excess [2-14C]orotate (OA) is quantitatively converted to [2-14C]OMP and then [2-14C]UMP with hydrolysis of the PPi. The reaction products are isolated on poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose (PEI-C) chromatograms. Human CCRF-CEM leukaemia cells growing in culture have been exposed to a number of antifolates and their effects upon cellular levels of PRPP determined. The steady-state level of PRPP measured in CCRF-CEM cells was 102+/-11 microM.

We undertook this study to investigate the prevalence of LIF gene alterations in women with unexplained infertility and with recurrent failure of implantation after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty five women with recurrent failure of implantation after IVF (group A), 50 with unexplained infertility (group B) and 105 fertile women (controls) were screened for LIF gene mutations. Standard genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification of the LIF gene and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis were used to search for mutations which were subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In group A, one woman was identified as having a neutral LIF gene polymorphism in exon 3 without affecting protein conformation. In group B, one woman with a heterozygous mutation and one with a neutral polymorphism were detected. In controls, only one woman with a neutral polymorphism in the intron between exons 2 and 3 was found. The woman with a potentially functional LIF gene mutation in group B achieved an ongoing clinical pregnancy after ovarian superovulation. DISCUSSION: Potentially functional mutations in the LIF gene do infrequently occur in women with unexplained infertility and may play a role in the etiology of infertility. However, routine screening for LIF mutations or polymorphisms in these women is not justified for the low prevalence of gene alterations.",,"['Steck, Thomas', 'Giess, Ralf', 'Suetterlin, Marc W', 'Bolland, Monika', 'Wiest, Stephanie', 'Poehls, Uwe G', 'Dietl, Johannes']","['Steck T', 'Giess R', 'Suetterlin MW', 'Bolland M', 'Wiest S', 'Poehls UG', 'Dietl J']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 4, D-97080 Wuerzburg, Germany. thomas.steck@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",0375672,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/genetics', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/adverse effects/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteal Phase', '*Mutation', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Treatment Failure']",2003/12/23 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/12/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301211503003154 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-2115(03)00315-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2004 Jan 15;112(1):69-73. doi: 10.1016/s0301-2115(03)00315-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The co-clustering of FcepsilonRI and FcgammaRIIB2 increased the [Ca(2+)](i) and induced the import of ERK2. However, the calcium increase was transient and ERK2 was rapidly exported to the cytoplasm. In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK2 and the production of TNF-alpha were decreased in case of co-clustering of FcepsilonRI and FcgammaRIIB2.

RR is considered to be an excellent target for anti cancer chemotherapy. We investigated the biochemical and antineoplastic effects of amidox as a single agent and in combination with Ara-C in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Amidox inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells in a growth inhibition assay with an IC50 of 25 microM. In a soft agar colony forming assay, amidox yielded a 50% inhibition of colony formation at 13 microM. We also investigated the effects of amidox treatment on the formation of deoxynucleosidetriphosphates. Amidox (50 and 75 microM for 24 hours) could significantly decrease intracellular concentrations of dCTP, dATP and dGTP pools, whereas dTTP levels increased. We then tested the combination effects of amidox with Ara-C; this combination yielded additive cytotoxic effects both in growth inhibition and in soft agar colony formation assays. This effect was due to the increased formation of Ara-CTP, the active metabolite of Ara-C, after preincubation with amidox. Preincubation of HL-60 cells with 75 and 100 microM amidox for 24 hours caused an increase in the intracellular Ara-CTP concentrations by 576% and 1143%, respectively.

Whereas, it is generally appreciated that patients with ASM are candidates for pharmacological intervention, no ideal drug or drug combination have been identified yet. One drug proposed to work in ASM is interferon alpha-2b (IFN-alpha2b). However, little is known so far about the quality of responses to IFN-alpha2b and actual response rates. We here report on five ASM patients treated with either a combination of IFN-alpha2b (3x3 million units per week) and prednisolone (n=4), or IFN-alpha2b alone (n=1). During therapy, two of the five patients showed a major response defined by complete resolution of C-Finding(s), one a partial response (partial regression of C-Findings), and one a stable disease (no changes in C-Findings). In one patient, progression to mast cell leukemia was seen after 3 months. In contrast to the other patients, this patient exhibited >10% MCs in his bone marrow (bm) smear at first presentation. In summary, our data confirm beneficial effects of IFN-alpha2b (plus prednisolone) for a group of patients with ASM, whereas patients with mast cell leukemia may require more aggressive therapy. Prospective trials with more patients are now required to further document these drug effects and to better define subgroups of patients with ASM who show good and long-lasting responses to IFN-alpha2b.",,"['Hauswirth, Alexander W', 'Simonitsch-Klupp, Ingrid', 'Uffmann, Martin', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Lechner, Klaus', 'Valent, Peter']","['Hauswirth AW', 'Simonitsch-Klupp I', 'Uffmann M', 'Koller E', 'Sperr WR', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/12/23 05:00,2004/03/23 05:00,['2003/12/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603002595 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00259-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Mar;28(3):249-57. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00259-5.,,,,,['Leuk Res. 2004 Mar;28(3):223-4.

METHODS: ES cells from Balb/C mice were cultured and maintained in an undifferentiated state in gelatin-coated dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1000 U/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Then, LIF was withdrawn from the DMEM to allow the ES cells to develop into embryonic bodies (EBs). EBs were plated onto tissue culture dishes, and growth factors such as acidicfibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were added to the medium to promote directional differentiation. The course of development and differentiation was observed dynamically using an inversion microscope. The expression of hepatic proteins, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), cytokeratin 8 (CK8), cytokeratin 18 (CK18), in cytoplasm was analyzed by immunocytochemistry (ICC). The concentration of ALB in the medium was determined dynamically by radioimmunoassay (RIA). RESULTS: ES cells replicated as clones, without differentiating, in DMEM containing LIF. They developed into EBs in medium without LIF. Our ICC assay showed that differentiating cells did not express hepatic proteins, such as AFP, ALB, CK8, and CK18 until day 7, day 9, day 11, and day 11, respectively (up to 2 days later when growth factors are not present). The concentration of AFP in the medium was first detected on day 8, at a concentration of 3.4 ng/ml, and increased to 22.8 ng/ml by day 15. The concentration of ALB in the medium was 0.2 micro g/ml on day 11, and increased to 2.2 micro g/ml by day 15. ALB-positive cells under ICC manifest morphological structures were consistent with normal mouse hepatocytes. The differentiation ratio of hepatocytes in the ES cell differentiation system was 30% on day 15 (significantly lower without the presence of growth factors). CONCLUSIONS: ES cells can differentiate into mature hepatocytes. Growth factors, such as aFGF and HGF, can enhance this differentiation and produce sufficient numbers of functional hepatocytes.

Further, the limited availability of matching stem cell donors or an unfavourable risk profile for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) reduces the number of therapeutic options in a number of patients. To assess the possibility of stem cell mobilization (SCM) during imatinib therapy we performed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim)-induced SCM and subsequent aphaeresis in 15 chronic phase and three accelerated phase CML patients. Aphaeresis was successful in 13 patients (72%) (> or =2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg body weight) and five (28%) harvests could be obtained, which were negative for BCR/ABL mRNA as assessed by nested-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All harvests, except one, were negative after first round RT-PCR, implicating a low level of CML cell contamination. There was no significant change in peripheral BCR/ABL transcript load after SCM as assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Fifteen patients remained stable in complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) during a median observation period of 9.3 months. One patient achieved a molecular remission shortly after SCM. Another patient who exhibited rising BCR/ABL mRNA levels before SCM achieved CCR after autologous SCT with the generated harvest. One patient with a Philadelphia chromosome-negative, BCR/ABL-positive CML showed a cytogenetic relapse 6 months after SCM.

We examined whether apicidin potentiates the imatinib-induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-positive human leukaemia cells. In K562 cells, the co-administration of minimally toxic concentrations of imatinib and apicidin (imatinib/apicidin) for 48 h produced a marked increase in mitochondrial damage, processing of caspase cascades and apoptosis. Similar results were observed in leukaemic blasts obtained from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis. Imatinib/apicidin co-treatment for 48 h resulted in a near complete loss of the full-length XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) protein, with a corresponding increase in the 29-kDa XIAP cleavage product. Both the degradation of XIAP and increased release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO) into the cytosol were abrogated by pretreatment with the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO. Imatinib/apicidin co-treatment for 48 h produced a prominent decrease in Bcr-Abl protein levels in a caspase-dependent manner. In summary, these data indicate that apicidin potentiates the imatinib-induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-positive leukaemia cells through the enhanced activation of the mitochondria-dependent caspase cascades, accompanied by caspase-dependent downregulation of Bcr-Abl and XIAP.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of beta2-adrenergic compounds, well known cAMP-inducing drugs, on the in vitro survival of leukaemia cells. In contrast to the short-acting beta2-mimetic (beta2Mim) salbutamol, a consistent pro-apoptotic effect was observed with the long-acting beta2Mim salmeterol and formoterol. Normal B cells isolated from control donors were totally resistant to the above molecules. These compounds also increased chlorambucil- and fludarabine-induced death of B-CLL cells. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptor signalling or cAMP did not alter B-CLL apoptosis with beta2 Mimagents. Leukaemia cell apoptosis by beta2Mim correlated with an increase in calcium influx, decreased bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, increase in BAX gene expression and a marked rise in BCL2/BAX mRNA ratios. Interleukin-4, a cytokine that increases bcl-2 expression in B-CLL cells, rescued leukaemia cell from apoptosis with beta2Mim.

In attempts to find selective inhibitors of this acid amidase, we screened various derivatives of palmitic acid, 1-hexadecanol, and 1-pentadecylamine with N-palmitoylethanolamine as substrate.

The inhibition was reversible and non-competitive. This compound also inhibited the acid amidase in intact alveolar macrophages.

In the present study, we developed a new real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR) method for quantitating WT1 transcripts. Results of intraassay and interassay variability tests demonstrated that the real-time WT1 assay had high reproducibility. WT1 expression levels measured by the RQ- and the CQ-PCR methods were strongly correlated (r = 0.998). Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed among WT1 transcript values normalized with 3 different control genes (beta-actin, ABL, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and between relative WT1 transcript values with WT1 expression in K562 cells as the reference and absolute WT1 transcript copy numbers per microgram RNA. When WT1 expression and minor bcr-abl expression were concurrently monitored in 2 patients with bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, both MRDs changed mostly in parallel, indicating the reliability and validity of our RQ-PCR method.

In this study, we prospectively studied 324 Thai adult acute leukemia patients, 79 (24%) of whom were identified as having ALL. Immunophenotyping was performed by 5-parameter flow cytometry, and karyotyping was conducted by standard banding methods. The Ph chromosome was detected in 18.5% of cases. The mean age of Ph+ ALL patients was 29 years (50% male), and that of Ph- ALL patients was 33 years (62% female). The Ph+ ALL patients had significantly higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (mean, 93 x 10(9)/L), with 67% having WBC counts higher than 50 x 10(9)/L. In contrast, most Ph- ALL patients had WBC counts lower than 50 x 10(9)/L (mean, 36 x 10(9)/L; P < .05). CD10 and CD34 were more highly expressed in the Ph+ ALL patients (mean expression, 83% and 87%, respectively) than in the Ph- ALL patients (45% and 57%; P < .005). The aberrant expression of myeloid antigens, including CD33 and CD13, was also significantly observed in the Ph+ ALL patients. The median survival time of Ph+ ALL patients was 8 months, compared with 22 months for the Ph- ALL patients. In conclusion, immunophenotyping results showed that Ph+ ALL in Thai adults arises from B-cells at an earlier stage of development. Extreme leukocytosis, a younger age, male sex, high expression levels of CD10 and CD34, aberrant myeloid antigens, and poorer rates of survival appeared to be associated with the Ph chromosome in Thai adult ALL cases.

Because conventional chemotherapy, which is active against other lymphoid malignancies, was proven to be ineffective for treating aggressive forms of ATL, ATL has become the target of several clinical studies for the purpose of improving therapeutic outcomes. Combination chemotherapy exclusively designed for ATL has considerably elevated the treatment response rate in ATL patients, but it has not sufficiently extended the median survival time. The introduction of antiviral agents has led to surprising effects for patients with acute ATL. Monoclonal antibodies seem to be promising, especially for patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease. Unfortunately, these approaches did not prove to be sufficient for most patients with ATL to obtain long-term survival.

Until recently, it was believed that HTLV-1 was largely latent in vivo. However, evidence from a number of types of experiments shows that HTLV-1 persistently expresses its genes, and that the ""set point"" of an individual's proviral load of HTLV-1 is mainly determined by the efficiency of that individual's cellular immune response to the virus.

The virus promotes T-cell proliferation by usurping several signaling pathways central to immune T-cell function, such as antigen stimulation and receptor-ligand interaction, suggesting that extracellular signals are important for HTLV-1 oncogenesis. Environmental factors such as chronic antigen stimulation may therefore be of importance, as also suggested by epidemiological data.

The human hepatoma line HepG2, the human lymphoblastoid line AHH-1 and the murine lymphoma cells YAC-1 were used as test systems. Active cell death (= apoptosis) and necrosis were detected by different flow cytometric methods: the binding of annexin V to the cell membrane and staining with propidium iodide (PI), the TUNEL assay for detection of DNA fragmentation and the occurrence of a sub G1 peak in cell cycle histograms. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analysed with the fluorescent probe JC-1. In addition to cytotoxicity, effects of INH on cell cycle were studied in HepG2 cells. The data of the present investigations indicate that INH induces cytotoxicity via apoptosis both in hepatoma and lymphoma cells. Twenty-four hours of application of INH in concentrations > 26 mM led to a remarkable number of apoptotic cells positive for Annexin V. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by a break down of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the occurrence of DNA strand breaks. At incubation times from 36 to 48 hours, a sub-G1 peak of late apoptotic cells was detected in cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, cell cycle studies showed a disruption of the cycle at low concentrations of INH which are only mildly cytotoxic.

To analyze the prognostic impact of age, gender, nutritional status, initial white blood cell count and use of etoposide in the remission induction phase. METHODS: This partly prospective/retrospective study comprised 83 children with AML diagnosed at Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil, between 1986 and 2000. Before 1991, 15 children were treated with 2-3 pulses of cytarabin plus daunomycin, followed by several consolidation/maintenance schemes. From January 1991 to November 1992 a pilot study (n = 15) was carried out to test etoposide toxicity in the induction phase. Etoposide was randomized from December 1992 to June 1999. RESULTS: Median follow-up period was 5 years. Initial remission rates were 40 and 66% before or after the introduction of the German protocol, respectively (p = 0.11). Induction failure was largely due to death caused by infection and/or hemorrhage. The 5-year estimated probabilities of survival and of continuous complete remission were 31+/-5.4% and 49.7+/-7.4%, respectively. All 22 relapses involved the bone marrow. Age below 6 years at diagnosis was significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Sex, initial leukocyte count, and nutritional variables were not significant prognostic factors. The randomized addition of etoposide in the induction phase unexpectedly decreased the probability of complete remission at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a German-based protocol in 1991 significantly improved survival and duration of first remission.

We show here that all Env subunits of the virus form disulphide-linked SU-TM complexes that can be disrupted by treatment with NP-40, heat or urea, or by Ca(2+) depletion. Thiol mapping indicated that these conditions induced isomerization of the disulphide-bond by activating a thiol group in a Cys-X-X-Cys (CXXC) motif in SU. This resulted in dissociation of SU from the virus. The active thiol was hidden in uninduced virus but became accessible for alkylation by either Ca(2+) depletion or receptor binding. The alkylation inhibited isomerization, virus fusion and infection. DTT treatment of alkylated Env resulted in cleavage of the SU-TM disulphide-bond and rescue of virus fusion. Further studies showed that virus fusion was specifically inhibited by high and enhanced by low concentrations of Ca(2+).

Upon LIF withdrawal, most cells differentiate into various lineages, while some die by apoptosis within 3 days. We have analyzed the activation pattern of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families and characterized the expression profile of selected genes modulated during differentiation or apoptosis. We show that p38 MAPKs are activated first, during the apoptotic crisis, while extracellular-regulated kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases are induced after the apoptotic crisis in differentiated cells. However, by using both p38 kinase inhibitors (PD169316 and SB203580) and a p38alpha(-/-) cell line, we demonstrate that p38alpha activation is rather a consequence than a cause of apoptosis. We thus reveal novel properties of PD169316, which induces cell survival without impairing cell differentiation, and identify PD169316-sensitive targets like the fibroblast growth factor-5, Brachyury and bcl-2 genes.

METHODS: Five-year survival between countries was compared for all malignancies and for the major diagnostic categories, adjusting for age, and estimated average European survival weighting for differences in childhood populations. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, survival variation was large (45% in Estonia to 90% in Iceland), and was generally low (60-70%) in eastern Europe and high (> or =75%) in Switzerland, Germany and the Nordic countries (except Denmark). The Nordic countries had the highest survival for four of the seven major tumour types: nephroblastoma (92%), acute lymphoid leukaemia (85%), CNS tumours (73%) and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (62%). The eastern countries had lowest survival: 89% for Hodgkin's disease, 71% for nephroblastoma, 68% for acute lymphoid leukaemia, 61% for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 57% for central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 29% for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The Nordic countries represent a survival gold standard to which other countries can aspire.

In order to identify regulatory elements of the proto-oncogene HOX11 that may be mutated in a subset of childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia specimens, we generated nested deletions from a P1 artificial chromosome (PAC). This clone contained 95 kilobases (kb) of the HOX11 locus at 10q24; including 63 kb of 5' regulatory DNA. The deletion series was produced by the use of a recombination based cloning system and clones were subsequently transfected into mammalian cells. We have identified several long-range regulatory elements that mediate transcriptional control of HOX11. This approach is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. Furthermore, it generates multiple deletion clones in a single experiment. This novel approach opens up a new avenue for investigating long-range transcription control. Additionally, by allowing analysis of these elements in the natural context of large integrants the approach does not require the use of artificial extrachromosomal elements. This methodology can be applied to any gene cloned into a PAC or BAC vector and could also be useful in identifying appropriately sized deletion mutants for functional testing in transgenic models.",,"['Brake, Rachael L', 'Chatterjee, Pradeep K', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Watt, Paul M']","['Brake RL', 'Chatterjee PK', 'Kees UR', 'Watt PM']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, WA 6872, Australia. rachaelb@ichr.uwa.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GCGGCCGC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Human', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2003/12/20 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/12/20 05:00'],"['2003/12/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03025014 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.11.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Jan 9;313(2):327-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.11.117.,,,"['1U56 CA92077-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SO 608049/SO/PHSPO CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several mechanisms can account for this deficient cell death pathway. These include overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as members of the Bcl-2 family, which control the opening of the mitochondrial transition permeability pore, and of the IAP (inhibitors of apoptosis) family, which inhibit the activity of caspases. The latter is also suppressed by nitric oxide (NO) released through an inducible NO synthase present in the leukemic cells. The activity of the receptors with a death domain (Fas, TRAIL) is impaired, thus contributing to the resistance to spontaneous and/or drug-induced apoptosis. Interferons as well as several cytokines and angiogenic factors are also involved in the failure of programmed cell death, either by providing efficient signals for survival (BAFF) or by counteracting the apoptotic process. A better knowledge of the mechanisms of survival and escape from apoptosis of B-CLL cells has led to the proposal of new drugs that selectively interfere at the different steps of these cascades. Their study is complicated by the lack of suitable cell lines and pre-clinical models.

Physiologically, these phenomena have been implicated in regulating immune functions and repertoire generation. Clinically, they form the basis of inclusion of GC in essentially all chemotherapy protocols for lymphoid malignancies. In spite of their significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-leukemic GC effects and the clinically important phenomenon of GC resistance are still unknown. This review summarizes recent findings related to GC-induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and GC resistance with particular emphasis on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We hypothesize that under conditions of physiological Bcl-2 expression, GC might induce classical programmed cell death by directly perturbing the Bcl-2 rheostat. In the presence of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, cell death might result from accumulating catabolic and/or other detrimental GC effects driven by, and critically dependent on, GC receptor (GR) autoinduction. Although still controversial, there is increasing evidence for release of apoptogenic factors through pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, rather than deltapsiloss-dependent membrane rupture, with maintenance of mitochondrial function at least in the early phase of the death response. GC-induced cell cycle arrest in ALL cells appears to be independent of apoptosis induction and vice versa, and critically depends on repression of both cyclin-D3 and c-myc followed by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27Kip1. Since development of GC-resistant clones requires both cell cycle progression and survival, GC resistance might frequently result from structural or regulatory defects in GR expression, perhaps the most efficient means to target both pathways concurrently.",,"['Renner, K', 'Ausserlechner, M J', 'Kofler, R']","['Renner K', 'Ausserlechner MJ', 'Kofler R']","['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, University of Innsbruck Medical School, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2003/12/20 05:00,2004/03/20 05:00,['2003/12/20 05:00'],"['2003/12/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1566524033479357 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2003 Dec;3(8):707-17. doi: 10.2174/1566524033479357.,,,,,,223,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study base comprised 4297 adults (aged 40-69 years in 1993) who had either visited the outpatient clinic or who had received annual health check-ups at the A Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan, between 1985 and 1992 (HTLV-I seropositivity = 24.7%).

Among the 19 females and 15 males, aged 31-72 years, there were 17 IgG, 9 IgA and 1 IgM, one with plasma cell leukaemia and 6 with light chain disease. Staging according to Durie and Salmon disclosed: 7--IIA stage, 15--IIIA and 12--IIIB. Blood hyperviscosity symptoms (HS) developed in 9 patients, and precomatic state or coma was observed in four of them. Control group was constituted of 14 healthy subjects--10 women and 4 men aged 32-51 years. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) serum concentration in MM patients varied from 0 pg/ml to 760 pg/ml, mean 148.75 pg/ml, SD = 204.4 and in controls 0 pg/ml--164 pg/ml, mean 31.5, SD = 23.3; p < 0.05. The mean VEGF level in recently diagnosed patients was higher than in progression of the disease, mean 188.6 pg/ml, SD = 230.6 and mean 110.9 pg/ml, SD = 177.9; respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. The patients with stage III had significantly (p < 0.05) higher VEGF level than those in stage II (mean 303.1 pg/ml, SD = 302.2 and mean 89.0 pg/ml SD = 121.6) respectively. The group of MM patients with renal failure (creatinine level > 2 mg%) had higher VEGF level than those with normal renal function: mean 199.9 pg/ml, SD = 235, and mean 46.9 SD = 47 respectively, p < 0.01. Elevated VEGF level was also present in comatic and precomatic patients when compared with hyperviscosity patients without these symptoms (p < 0.05). In multiple myeloma patients no correlation was found between the serum VEGF level and percentage of bone marrow plasma cells, serum beta-2-m and monoclonal Ig levels, levels of Hb, albumine and LDH. Median survival time (M-ST) of patients with VEGF higher than 71, 0 pg/ml was 32 months, M-ST of patients with VEGF below 71 pg/ml was 52 months. In summary: serum level of VEGF in advanced state of multiple myeloma was elevated and correlated with clinical state.

However, one downside of this vector is that viral titer significantly varies depending on the packaging lines used. Results from Northern blot analysis indicated that in certain cell lines the genomic transcript containing the packaging signal sequence was too efficiently spliced to the subgenomic RNA, resulting in low levels of genomic RNA and thus leading to a low viral titer. We tested the possibility of overcoming this problem by introducing mutations around the splice acceptor sequence in such a way that a delicate balance was maintained between the splicing efficiency (which determines the level of gene expression) and the amount of genomic transcript (which influences viral titer). After mutational analysis, one such mutant was found to meet this requirement.

It has been implicated in playing a role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in man, since it is hypermethylated with high frequency. We provide evidence that the gene is a tumor suppressor for myeloid leukemia in mice. The evidence is twofold: (1) retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemias of the myelomonocytic phenotype were found to have hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the Ink4b gene, and this could be correlated with reduced mRNA expression, as demonstrated by TaqMan real-time PCR. p15(Ink4b) mRNA expression in a leukemia cell line, with hypermethylation at the locus, was induced following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. (2) Targeted deletion of one allele in mice by removal of exon 2 increases their susceptibility to retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemia.

The cDNA was subcloned in the pRK bacterial expression plasmid and used to transform BLR (DE3) Escherichia coli. A single transformed colony was grown in Superbroth with ampicillin; bacteria were centrifuged at an OD(650) of 1.3; master cell bank aliquots of bacteria in 30% glycerol/Superbroth were frozen and stored at -80 degrees C. Master cell bank bacteria were diluted 1500-fold into Superbroth and recombinant protein was induced with 1 mM IPTG at an OD(650) of 0.6. After two additional hours of fermentation, inclusion bodies were isolated, washed, and denatured in guanidine hydrochloride and dithioerythritol. Recombinant protein was refolded by diluted 100-fold in cold buffer with arginine and oxidized glutathione. After dialysis, purified protein was obtained after anion-exchange, size exclusion on FPLC, and polymyxin B affinity chromatography. The final material was filter sterilized, aseptically vialed, and stored at -80 degrees C. Seventy-five 3-L bacterial culture preparations were made and pooled for the AT-1 batch (568 mL) and twenty-four 3-L bacterial culture preparations were made and pooled for the AT-2 batch (169 mL).

In the present study, we observed the constitutive over-expression of two transcripts related to PAC-1 in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. By screening a LGL leukemia cDNA library using the 3' end of a PAC-1 probe, we obtained a clone (clone 8) which retains one and one half introns, excludes two exons, and matches one hundred percent with a DNA sequence on chromosome 2. The deduced amino acid sequence of the predicted protein contains 170 amino acids and is 144 amino acids shorter than PAC-1. When we expressed this protein in Escherichia coli as a GST-fusion protein, a 45 kDa (19 kDa PAC-1 variant+26 kDa GST protein) protein was obtained. The expressed protein was purified to near homogeneity by using a glutathione affinity column. The purified protein did not have any intrinsic phosphatase activity when assayed in vitro.

Recent studies suggest that oxidation products or metabolites are involved in biological activities of carotenoids. We previously reported that an autoxidation mixture of lycopene induced apoptosis in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, but lycopene alone did not. In the present study, bioassay-directed fractionations of autoxidized lycopene led to isolation of a novel cleavage product of lycopene. Spectral analyses elucidated its structure as (E,E,E)-4-methyl-8-oxo-2,4,6-nonatrienal (MON), suggesting the formation through the oxidative cleavages at the 5, 6- and 13, 14-double bonds of lycopene. MON was proved to cause a dose-dependent reduction of viability in HL-60 cells with morphological changes such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Treatment of HL-60 cells with MON could induce DNA fragmentation and increase apoptotic cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The MON treatment could enhance both caspase 8 and caspase 9 activities. Moreover, it reduced the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins, whereas it had no effect on the level of Bax protein. These results clearly indicated that MON induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, associated with the down regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and the activation of caspase cascades. The concentration of MON attained by treatment of the autoxidized lycopene preparation was far less than the IC50 (10 microM) value of MON alone in reducing the viability of HL-60 cells. The fractionation of the oxidized lycopene indicated the presence of other active oxidation products. Thus, unidentified products as well as MON would be responsible for the apoptosis-inducing activity of the autoxidized lycopene.",,"['Zhang, Hong', 'Kotake-Nara, Eiichi', 'Ono, Hiroshi', 'Nagao, Akihiko']","['Zhang H', 'Kotake-Nara E', 'Ono H', 'Nagao A']","['National Food Research Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carotenoids/*chemistry', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lycopene', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",2003/12/19 05:00,2004/08/10 05:00,['2003/12/19 05:00'],"['2003/12/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584903006476 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2003 Dec 15;35(12):1653-63. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.09.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty untreated patients diagnosed as endometrial carcinoma through dilation and curettage of the uteri were divided into 3 groups at random. Each group was given medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), (500 mg/day) or mifepristone (MIF), (100 mg/day) or MIF (100 mg/day) + MPA (500 mg/day) for 5 days respectively. On the sixth day, hysterectomy was performed on these patients. The endometrial cancer specimen of post-hysterectomy was compared with the one of pre-administrating. The morphologic changes of the endometrial cancer cells were observed through light microscope. Immunohistochemistry assay (SP method) was applied to determine the localization and immunoreactive intensity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), B-cell leukemia lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), bcl-2 associated X protein (bax) and CD(44v6). RESULTS: Better differentiation degree and active excretion were observed in all of the post-hysterectomy endometrial specimen. In the same time, apoptosis of carcinoma cells was observed. The most significant changes were seen in the MIF + MPA group. In the MPA group, the pre-treatment and post-treatment expression of PR (2.9 +/- 1.1, 1.6 +/- 0.8), ER (2.8 +/- 0.9, 1.4 +/- 0.9), PCNA (0.84 +/- 0.10, 0.60 +/- 0.12), bcl-2 (0.236 +/- 0.089, 0.157 +/- 0.981) and CD(44v6) (4.6 +/- 1.8, 2.5 +/- 1.9) were all decreased (all P < 0.01); the expression of bax (0.20 +/- 0.10, 0.42 +/- 0.07) was increased (P < 0.01). In the MIF group, the expression of PR (3.4 +/- 1.0, 1.9 +/- 0.8), ER (2.7 +/- 0.9, 1.2 +/- 0.7), PCNA (0.80 +/- 0.15, 0.65 +/- 0.10), bcl-2 (0.214 +/- 0.097, 0.121 +/- 0.073) were all decreased (all P < 0.01); the expression of bax (0.21 +/- 0.05, 0.44 +/- 0.09) was increased (P < 0.01); no significant change in the expression of CD(44v6) (4.2 +/- 2.0, 4.3 +/- 1.7) was seen (P > 0.05). In the MIF + MPA group, the expression of PR (3.2 +/- 1.0, 0.8 +/- 0.8), ER (2.7 +/- 0.9, 0.7 +/- 0.9), PCNA (0.81 +/- 0.09, 0.25 +/- 0.09), bcl-2 (0.225 +/- 0.091, 0.066 +/- 0.009) and CD(44v6) (4.5 +/- 1.9, 2.7 +/- 1.6) were all decreased (all P < 0.01); the expression of bax (0.22 +/- 0.06, 0.59 +/- 0.09) was increased (P < 0.01); there were significant different expression of PCNA, ER, PR, bax and bcl-2 as compared with the MIF group and the MPA group, respectively (all P < 0.01). The expression of CD(44v6) was significantly different (P < 0.01) between the MIF + MPA group, and the MIF group, but not significantly different between the MIF + MPA group and the MPA group. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that high dose progesterone could inhibit the growth, promote apoptosis and inhibit metastasis of endometrial carcinoma, MIF could inhibit the growth and promote apoptosis, MIF + MPA could more strongly inhibit the growth, promote apoptosis and inhibit metastasis of endometrial carcinoma than MIF or MPA, and synergistic effect was observed on the expression of PCNA, ER, PR, bax and bcl-2.",,"['Li, Chang-zhong', 'Wen, Ze-qing', 'Lan, Shou-min', 'Wang, Jia-yao', 'Liu, Ying']","['Li CZ', 'Wen ZQ', 'Lan SM', 'Wang JY', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospitial, Jinan 250021, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",China,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,16210370R,"['0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Mifepristone/*administration & dosage', 'Progesterone/*administration & dosage', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis', 'Receptors, Progesterone/analysis']",2003/12/19 05:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/12/19 05:00'],"['2003/12/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi. 2003 Sep;38(9):552-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the effect of beta-carotene, vitamin C and alpha-tocopherol on radiation-induced apoptosis in cells in culture. Human T-lymphoblastic MOLT-3 cells were irradiated with a dose of 3 Gy 1 h after or immediately prior to the addition of vitamins in three concentrations (0.01 microM, 1 microM and 100 microM). Eight hours later, apoptosis was scored morphologically by staining the nuclear DNA with Hoechst 33342. When given prior to irradiation, beta-carotene and vitamin E reduced the amount of radiation-induced apoptosis significantly at concentrations of 0.01 microM and 1 microM. In contrast, vitamin C did not show any protective effect when given at these two concentrations and caused a slight but significant radiosensitization at 100 microM. At 0.01 microM, all combinations of two vitamins showed a protective effect. This was also observed for the combination of all three vitamins at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microM. When given immediately after irradiation, each of the three vitamins showed a protective effect at 0.01 microM. In addition, the combination of alpha-tocopherol and vitamin C reduced radiation-induced apoptosis slightly when given at 1 microM. In all other cases, no statistically significant modulation of radiation-induced apoptosis was observed. In our experimental system, the protective effect of beta-carotene and vitamin E was dependent on concentration and occurred only in the micromolar and sub-micromolar concentration range, while vitamin C alone, but not in combinations, had a sensitizing effect, thus arguing for a careful consideration of vitamin concentrations in clinical settings.",,"['Ortmann, Elisabeth K', 'Mayerhofer, Thomas', 'Getoff, Nikola', 'Kodym, Reinhard']","['Ortmann EK', 'Mayerhofer T', 'Getoff N', 'Kodym R']","['Department of Radiobiology, Clinic for Radiotherapy and Radiobiology General Hospital Vienna, The University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Vitamins)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Vitamins/*pharmacology', 'alpha-Tocopherol/pharmacology', 'beta Carotene/pharmacology']",2003/12/19 05:00,2004/03/16 05:00,['2003/12/19 05:00'],"['2003/12/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['RR3102 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3102 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2004 Jan;161(1):48-55. doi: 10.1667/rr3102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear, however, whether donor T cell recognition of these hematopoietically derived minor histocompatibility antigens will induce significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Using established bone marrow irradiation chimeras across the multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-disparate, C57BL/6-->BALB.B combination, we studied the occurrence of lethal GVHD mediated by CD4+ T cells in recipient mice expressing only hematopoietically derived alloantigens. Even substantial dosages of donor C57BL/6 CD4+ T cells were unable to elicit lethal GVHD when transplanted into [BALB.B-->C57BL/6] chimeras. Instead, chimeric mice displayed transient cachexia with reduced target-tissue injury over time, reflecting an early, limited, graft-versus-host response. On the other hand, the importance of minor histocompatibility antigens derived from nonhematopoietic tissues was demonstrated by the finding that [C57BL/6-->BALB.B] chimeric mice succumbed to C57BL/6 CD4+ T cell-mediated GVHD.

To better understand the molecular pathways leading to cell transformation, we aimed to identify cellular proteins interacting with Tax. METHODS: We used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify interacting cellular proteins. Interactions between Tax and candidate interacting cellular proteins were confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy. Functional interactions between Tax and one interacting protein, tristetraprolin (TTP), were assessed by analyzing the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is regulated by TTP, in mammalian cells (HeLa, D17, HEK 293, and RAW 264.7) transiently transfected with combinations of intact and mutant Tax and TTP. RESULTS: We obtained seven interacting cellular proteins, of which one, TTP, was further characterized. Tax and TTP were found to interact specifically through their respective carboxyl-terminal domains. The proteins colocalized in the cytoplasm in a region surrounding the nucleus of HeLa cells. Furthermore, coexpression of Tax was associated with nuclear accumulation of TTP. TTP is an immediate-early protein that inhibits expression of TNF-alpha at the post-transcriptional level. Expression of Tax reverted this inhibition, both in transient transfection experiments and in stably transfected macrophage cell lines. CONCLUSION: Tax, through its interactions with the TTP repressor, indirectly increases TNF-alpha expression. This observation is of importance for the cell transformation process induced by leukemogenic retroviruses, because TNF-alpha overexpression plays a central role in pathogenesis.",,"['Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Kruys, Veronique', 'Lefebvre, Laurent', 'Vanderplasschen, Alain', 'Collete, Delphine', 'Debacq, Christophe', 'Lai, Wi S', 'Jauniaux, Jean-Claude', 'Bernstein, Lori R', 'Semmes, O John', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Blackshear, Perry J', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Willems, Luc']","['Twizere JC', 'Kruys V', 'Lefebvre L', 'Vanderplasschen A', 'Collete D', 'Debacq C', 'Lai WS', 'Jauniaux JC', 'Bernstein LR', 'Semmes OJ', 'Burny A', 'Blackshear PJ', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Biologie cellulaire et moleculaire, Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Tristetraprolin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (ZFP36 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/virology', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Transfection', 'Tristetraprolin', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2003/12/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/12/18 05:00'],"['2003/12/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/djg118 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Dec 17;95(24):1846-59. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djg118.,,,"['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 R29 CA73783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge of the potential side-effects of chemotherapy on the developing fetus is essential for patient counseling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected information concerning patients treated with anthracyclines during pregnancy from a review of literature between 1976 and 2001 and our experience. The events analyzed were malformations, fetal death and spontaneous abortion. A chi(2) test with a Yates correction was used to compare the distribution of severe events. RESULTS: A total of 160 patient pregnancies were analyzed. The fetal outcome was frequently normal (73%). Abnormalities included malformations (3%), fetal death (9%), spontaneous abortion (3%), fetal complications (8%) and prematurity (6%). Fetal death was often directly consecutive to maternal death (40%). Unfavorable fetal outcome was significantly more frequent in leukemia patients (P = 0.001). In patients with solid tumors, the first trimester was significantly associated with more complications (P = 0.029). The risk of severe fetal toxicity was increased 30-fold when the dose of doxorubicin per cycle exceeded 70 mg/m(2) (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Anthracyclines may induce embryo-fetal toxicity.

Roscovitine prevented the tyrosine phosphorylation and consequent activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 when presented to MT-2 cells in the presence or absence of a caspase-3 inhibitor, and ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of STAT5 in MT-2 cells induced apoptosis. Roscovitine and dominant-negative STAT5 also reduced the expression of the antiapoptotic protein XIAP, and STAT5 was associated with the XIAP promoter in vivo. Antibody to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha receptors coprecipitated STAT5 from extracts of untreated but not roscovitine-treated cells. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate ablated the inhibitory effects of roscovitine on STAT5/PDGF alpha receptor interaction, STAT5 activity, and cell survival.

Coadministration of marginally toxic concentrations of 17-AAG with sublethal concentrations of SB or SAHA resulted in highly synergistic induction of mitochondrial damage (i.e., cytochrome c release), caspase-3 and -8 activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were noted in human promyelocytic (HL-60) and lymphoblastic (Jurkat) leukemia cells. These events were accompanied by multiple perturbations in signal transduction, cell cycle, and survival-related pathways, including early down-regulation of Raf-1, inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2, diminished expression of phospho-Akt, and late activation of c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase, but no changes in expression of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Coadministration of 17-AAG blocked SAHA-mediated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1) and resulted in reduced expression of p27(KIP1) and p34(cdc2). 17-AAG/SAHA-treated cells also displayed down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and evidence of Bcl-2 cleavage. Enforced expression of doxycycline-inducible p21(CIP1) or constitutively active MEK1 significantly diminished 17-AAG/SAHA-mediated lethality, indicating that interference with ERK activation and p21(CIP1) induction play important functional roles in the lethal effects of this regimen. In contrast, enforced expression of constitutively active Akt failed to exert cytoprotective actions. Together, these findings indicate that coadministration of SAHA or SB with the Hsp90 antagonist 17-AAG in human leukemia cells leads to multiple perturbations in signaling, cell cycle, and survival pathways that culminate in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. They also raise the possibility that combining such agents with Hsp90 antagonists may represent a novel antileukemic strategy.",,"['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Yu, Chunrong', 'Dai, Yun', 'Reese, Erin', 'Ahmed, Wesam', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Yu C', 'Dai Y', 'Reese E', 'Ahmed W', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Butyrates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Rifabutin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vorinostat']",2003/12/18 05:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2003/12/18 05:00'],"['2003/12/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Dec 1;63(23):8420-7.,,,"['CA 100866-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To generate a recombinant immunotoxin, the anti-CD64 single chain fragment (scFv) m22 was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pBM1.1 and fused to a deletion mutant of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA'). Genetically modified Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) were grown under osmotic stress conditions in the presence of compatible solutes.

The characteristics of the recombinant protein were assessed by ELISA, flow cytometry, and toxicity assays, using CD64-positive AML cells. Binding specificity of m22(scFv)-ETA' was verified by competition with the parental anti-CD64 monoclonal antibody m22.

Here, we report that secreted extracellular Gal-3 can signal apoptosis of human T leukemia cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and activated mouse T cells after binding to cell surface glycoconjugate receptors through carbohydrate-dependent interactions because the apoptotic effect was found to be inhibited by lactose, specific sugar inhibitor, and to be dose dependent. However, the apoptosis sensitivity to Gal-3 varied among the different cell lines tested. We report that Gal-3-null Jurkat, CEM, and MOLT-4 cells were significantly more sensitive to exogenous Gal-3 than SKW6.4 and H9 cells, which express Gal-3, suggesting a cross-talk between the antiapoptotic activity of intracellular Gal-3 and proapoptotic activity of extracellular Gal-3. Furthermore, Gal-3-transfected CEM cells were found to be more resistant to C(2)-ceramide-induced apoptosis than the control CEM cells. Identification of Gal-3 cell surface receptors revealed that Gal-3 binding to CD7 and CD29 (beta(1) integrin) induced apoptosis. Gal-3 binding to its cell surface receptors results in activation of mitochondrial apoptosis events including cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, but not caspase-8 activation. Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of T-cell apoptosis by secreted Gal-3 may play a role in the immune escape mechanism during tumor progression through the induction of apoptosis to cancer-infiltrating T cells. The induction of T-cell apoptosis by secreted Gal-3 is dependent in part on the presence or absence of cytoplasmic Gal-3, providing a new insight for the immune escape mechanism of cancer cells.",,"['Fukumori, Tomoharu', 'Takenaka, Yukinori', 'Yoshii, Tadashi', 'Kim, Hyeong-Reh Choi', 'Hogan, Victor', 'Inohara, Hidenori', 'Kagawa, Susumu', 'Raz, Avraham']","['Fukumori T', 'Takenaka Y', 'Yoshii T', 'Kim HR', 'Hogan V', 'Inohara H', 'Kagawa S', 'Raz A']","['Tumor Progression and Metastasis Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD7/metabolism/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Galectin 3/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Transfection']",2003/12/18 05:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2003/12/18 05:00'],"['2003/12/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Dec 1;63(23):8302-11.,,,['CA46120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIPK2 colocalizes with Daxx, a protein acting in TGF-beta-induced JNK activation and apoptosis, in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and triggers PML-nuclear body disruption and release of Daxx. HIPK2 interacts in vitro and in vivo via its kinase domain with Daxx, and a fraction of Daxx coprecipitates with HIPK2 under physiological conditions. Moreover, overexpression of HIPK2 leads to Daxx phosphorylation, and ectopic expression of HIPK2 activates the JNK signaling pathway, which is enhanced by coexpression of Daxx. HIPK2 signals to JNK via a pathway using Daxx and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases MKK4/SEK1 and MKK7. Ectopic expression of HIPK2 and Daxx potentiates TGF-beta-induced apoptosis in human p53-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

Epidemiology of thrombosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,125-31,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. With the advent of aggressive multimodality therapy, ALL has become a curable disease for majority of pediatric patients. Thromboembolism (TE) is a well-recognized serious complication in association with ALL leading to significant morbidity. It can be potentially fatal in over 50% of the affected patients. Development of TE does interfere with the scheduled treatment plan for ALL and, thus, ultimate outcome from ALL. Recent evidence indicates that concomitant administration of asparaginase and steroids is likely to be associated with higher incidence of TE, especially in children with at least one prothrombotic risk factor. In addition, older children and patients with high risk ALL may be at higher risk for developing TE. However, the epidemiology and the exact pathogenesis of this entity have not yet been clearly defined. To reduce the incidence of TE and its impact on overall outcome as well as on the quality of life in children undergoing treatment for ALL, further studies to define the epidemiology of TE in relation to the biology of ALL and chemotherapy protocols are urgently needed. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current knowledge of TE in association with ALL in children, especially in relation with the treatment protocols and genetic background. This review will be published in three parts.

Preclinical studies in mice have provided good evidence that subsets of NK cells that bear different combinations of both inhibitory and activating Ly49 receptors can interact with each other and target specific BMC rejection, as well as NK cell responses toward tumor cells. Recent clinical studies have also shown that the use of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand incompatibility in patients with leukemia who received hematopoietic stem cell transplants correlated not only with the elimination of graft rejection, but also with eradication of tumor and prevention of graft-versus-host disease; this offers a significant advantage for survival.

Weight-bearing joints are involved in over 90 % of the cases. Total joint replacement is often necessary to restore function. Yet, endoprostheses in young patients again bare the risk of later complications and the need for several revision surgeries. In this report, joint preserving surgical strategies will be discussed. PATIENTS: Three hips and eleven knee joints in 8 patients (4 male, 4 female) were operated on for symptomatic ON and/or osteochondral defects (OCD) after chemotherapy. Four of the patients underwent surgery in more than one joint. The average age at the time of surgery was 18 years (range 14 - 26). The procedures included retrograde drilling (core decompression), bone grafting, implantation of collagen sponges with autologous bone marrow aspirate, osteochondral autograft transplantation and transplantation of periosteal flaps. Two hip joints underwent total joint replacement. Average follow up was 25 months. RESULTS: After an average follow up of 2 years, all patients were satisfied with the functional results after the last follow up with pain free walking for a minimum of 60 minutes. No night pain was reported. One patient complained about intermittent periods of dysaesthesia around the bone harvest area at the iliac crest. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of surgery for ON and OCD after chemotherapy should be the reduction of pain and preservation of the joint to bypass the risks of joint replacement in young patients, although total joint replacement may become indicated in endstage degeneration of the involved joint.",,"['Werner, A', 'Jager, M', 'Schmitz, H', 'Krauspe, R']","['Werner A', 'Jager M', 'Schmitz H', 'Krauspe R']","['Orthopadische Klinik, Universitatsklinikum Dusseldorf, Germany. werner@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Arthroscopy', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hip Joint/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint/*surgery', 'Male', 'Osteochondritis/*chemically induced/*surgery', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/*surgery', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Time Factors', 'Walking']",2003/12/17 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2003/12/17 05:00'],"['2003/12/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2003-45495 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2003 Nov-Dec;215(6):332-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2003-45495.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to an increased survival of ALL patients, complications like BME (bone marrow edema) and AON (aseptic osteonecrosis) have become a matter of increasing importance. The aim of the study was to find out if a polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene predisposes to the development of BME and/or AON. Furthermore the cumulative prednisone equivalent dose per kilogram body weight was compared in a matched-pairs analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the MTHFR polymorphism of 87 patients was performed (48 male, 43 female). 14/87 patients were diagnosed with BME and/or AON (16 %). RESULTS: 42/73 patients without BME and/or AON (43 male, 34 female, median age 5.3 yrs) and 10/14 patients with BME/AON (5 male, 9 female, median age 10.2 years) presented with a MTHFR-polymorphism (p = 0.28). 14,3 % of the patients with MTHFR-polymorphism but without BME and/or AON (6/42) and 70 % of the patients with MTHFR-polymorphism and with BME and/or AON (7/10) were over 10 years of age at ALL diagnosis (p = 0.002). The mean cumulative prednisone equivalent dose per kilogram body weight was 98.0 mg, compared with 100.0 mg in the matched pairs group. CONCLUSIONS: The age of the patients at diagnosis seems to be a risk factor for the development of BME and/or AON as also seen in previous studies. If MTHFR polymorphism is an additional risk factor it was not borne out by this study, possible due to the small number of patients analyzed.

Both cytotoxic drugs are well-known to induce significant alterations in hemostasis, especially affecting the inhibitors of coagulation including antithrombin III (AT III), protein C and protein S. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The objectives of the present prospective study were to analyze the course and degree of the changes of several coagulation proteins during induction therapy of 16 patients treated according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) ALL protocol 2000. The induction protocol included a 7-day mono-therapy with glucocorticoids followed by 4 weeks with additional vincristine, daunorubicin and E. coli L-ASP (Medac) which was administered at a dosage of 5000 IU/m (2) 8-times at 3-day intervals. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is the first to show that 5000 IU/m (2) of the Medac L-ASP leads to a less pronounced decrease of the plasma AT III and fibrinogen concentrations during induction therapy (after the 5 (th) L-ASP dose), as compared to previous BFM protocols which used the Medac L-ASP in a dosage of 10 000 IU/m (2). Our results confirmed that following a mono-therapy with glucocorticoids the AT III, protein C and protein S levels increased while the fibrinogen level decreased. As the D-Dimers remained within the normal range during the 3 weeks of L-ASP combination chemotherapy and none of the patients suffered a thromboembolic event, we also concluded that despite of the significant decrease of anticoagulant proteins, there might be a balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis; thus the D-Dimers may eventually serve as a helpful indicator for therapeutic interventions.",,"['Attarbaschi, A', 'Mann, G', 'Kronberger, M', 'Witt, V', 'Gadner, H', 'Dworzak, M']","['Attarbaschi A', 'Mann G', 'Kronberger M', 'Witt V', 'Gadner H', 'Dworzak M']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (Protein S)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C/analysis', 'Protein S/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2003/12/17 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2003/12/17 05:00'],"['2003/12/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2003-45497 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2003 Nov-Dec;215(6):321-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2003-45497.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, overexpression of two LIM-only factors (LMOs) causes acute lymphocytic leukemia. The more recently discovered LMO factor LMO4 is highly expressed in proliferating epithelial cells, and frequently overexpressed in breast carcinoma. Here we show that while LMO4 is expressed throughout mammary gland development, it is dramatically upregulated in mammary epithelial cells during midpregnancy. The LMO coactivator Clim2/Ldb1/NLI showed a similar expression pattern, consistent with the idea that LMO4 and Clim2 act as a complex in mammary epithelial cells. In MCF-7 cells, LMO4 transcripts were upregulated by heregulin, an activator of ErbB receptors that are known to be important in mammary gland development and breast cancer. To test the hypothesis that LMO4 plays roles in mammary gland development, we created an engrailed-LMO4 fusion protein. This fusion protein maintains the ability to interact with Clim2, but acts as a dominant repressor of both basal and activated transcription when recruited to a DNA-regulatory region. When the engrailed-LMO4 fusion protein was expressed under control of the MMTV promoter in transgenic mice, both ductular development in virgin mice and alveolar development in pregnant mice were inhibited.

The first insights into the molecular etiology of this heterogeneous disease were obtained from a ""bedside-to-bench"" approach. Successful empiric treatment of patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis) ultimately led to the discovery of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion kinase in about half of the hypereosinophilic syndrome cases. RECENT FINDINGS: The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is generated by a cryptic interstitial chromosomal deletion, del(4)(q12q12), which indicates that these cases are clonal hematopoietic malignancies and should be reclassified as chronic eosinophilic leukemias based on current World Health Organization recommendations. In addition, the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene was also identified in cases with systemic mast cell disease. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is a therapeutic target of imatinib, forming a rational basis for the treatment of FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia and mastocytosis with imatinib. Similar to BCR-ABL-positive leukemias, resistance to imatinib due to point mutations in the PDGFRalpha kinase domain may develop. We have explored strategies to circumvent resistance to imatinib using alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as PKC412.

Although Imatinib, the first molecularly targeted drug developed for CML has achieved a remarkable success, the emergence of resistance to this agent mitigates the prospect of a cure for this leukemia. Though a variety of resistance mechanisms can arise, in the majority of patients resistance coincides with reactivation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein. This can result from gene amplification and, more importantly, point mutations that disrupt the bind of imatinib to BCR-ABL itself. In this review, we aim to define and illuminate mechanisms of resistance and describe how drug resistance is shedding new light on kinase domain regulation. RECENT FINDINGS: In light of recent studies and publications, it is now clear that Imatinib exerts its inhibitory action by stabilizing the inactive non ATP-binding conformation of BCR-ABL and that mutations even outside the kinase domain can lead to enhanced autophosphorylation of the kinase, thereby stabilizing the active conformation that resists imatinib binding. So far, 25 different substitutions of 21 amino acid residues of BCR-ABL have been detected in CML patients. In addition, it has been recently illustrated that mutations preexist the onset of treatment and that some confer a more aggressive disease phenotype.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence indicates that optimal dosage of cancer-related gene products plays an important role in the induction of mouse tumors that recapitulate their human counterparts. SUMMARY: The mouse is a very valuable model system for experimentally dissecting the in vivo pathogenesis of cancer, for identifying pharmacological targets of cancer and for evaluating cancer therapies. In modeling human cancer, it has been shown that both the timing of introducing/activating oncogenic mutation(s) and the cell types into which the genetic lesion(s) is targeted are critical for cancer development. Recent studies also showed that efficient induction of relevant human leukemia in mice by certain oncogenes, such as PML/RARalpha and TEL/ABL, only occurred when they were expressed at a low level or close to pathophysiologically relevant level. These studies stress the importance of studying oncoprotein function at pathophysiologically relevant expression levels. Conditional gene expression systems are powerful tools for developing mouse models for human cancer by introducing genetic lesions in a cell type-specific, time-controlled and dosage-relevant manner. The bone marrow retroviral transduction and transplantation system can also mimic the cell and temporally specific origin of hematological malignancies by targeting oncogenes into sorted hematopoietic cells. This versatile approach is particularly powerful in structure-function analysis of oncogenes in vivo. However, overexpression of a transgene driven by retroviral vectors may alter the biological outcomes of the transgene in vivo. My colleagues and I have shown that generating vectors with modulated transgene expression can overcome this limitation of the retroviral transduction system in modeling human cancer in mice. Conditional gene expression and the modified retroviral transduction systems will be complimentary in studying human cancers in mice.",,"['Ren, Ruibao']",['Ren R'],"['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454-9110, USA. ren@brandeis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Time Factors']",2003/12/17 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2003/12/17 05:00'],"['2003/12/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200401000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2004 Jan;11(1):25-34. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200401000-00005.,,,['CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,75,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this chemical reactivity and its synthesis at the perinuclear membrane, LTA(4) is enzymatically converted into the cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene B(4). Furthermore, LTA(4) participates in transcellular biosynthesis and is thus transferred between cells as an intact molecule. A cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein present in the rat basophilic leukemia cells was identified using mass spectrometry. This protein was determined to be the stabilizing factor present in the cell cytosol responsible for increasing the effective chemical half-life of LTA(4). Rat epithelial fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) was isolated using partial protein purification and immunoprecipitation. In-gel digestion with trypsin followed by peptide fingerprint analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and sequencing the major tryptic peptide obtained from liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis identified E-FABP in the active fraction. Semi-quantitative Western blot analysis indicated that E-FABP in the cytosolic fraction of RBL-1 cells was present at approximately 1-3 pmol/10(6) cells. E-FABP (9 microm) was tested for its ability to stabilize LTA(4), and at 37 degrees C E-FABP was able to increase the half-life of LTA(4) from the previously reported half-life less than 3 s to a half-life of approximately 7 min.

Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate synergistic activity and increased tumor apoptosis in B-cell malignancies when a prolonged infusion of bryostatin 1 is followed by vincristine. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We embarked on a Phase I trial of bryostatin 1 as a 24-h continuous infusion followed by bolus vincristine in patients with refractory B-cell malignancies other than acute leukemias. Twenty-four evaluable patients were enrolled. RESULTS: The dose-limiting toxicity was myalgia. The MTD and recommended Phase II dose of bryostatin 1 was 50 microg/m2/24 h followed by vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum total dose of 2 mg) repeated every 2 weeks. Significant antitumor activity was observed in this relapsed population, including patients who had failed high-dose chemotherapy. This included 5 durable complete and partial responses and 5 patients with stable disease lasting > or =6 months (range, 6-48+ months). Median time to response was 8 months. Correlative studies demonstrated a progressive increase in serum interleukin-6 with bryostatin 1 infusion followed by an additional increase after vincristine. Flow cytometry for detection of apoptosis in B and T cells showed an initial decrease in apoptotic frequency in CD5+ cells within 6 h of bryostatin 1 infusion compatible with its known increase in PKC activity in the majority of patients followed by a return to baseline or overall increase in apoptotic frequency after completion of infusion. All (5 of 5) patients who had an overall increase in apoptotic frequency in CD5+ cells achieved either a clinical response or prolonged stable disease. Four of these 5 patients did not have the initial decrement in apoptosis at 6 h.

The pX ORFs are encoded by mono- or bicistronic mRNAs that are generated by alternative splicing. The various pX mRNAs result from skipping of the internal exon (2-exon versus 3-exon isofoms) or from the utilization of alternative splice acceptor sites in the terminal exon. The Rex and Tax proteins, encoded by ORFs X-III and X-IV, have been studied intensively and are encoded by the most abundant of the alternative 3-exon mRNAs. The protein products of the other pX ORFs have not been detected in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and the levels of the corresponding mRNAs have not been accurately established. We have used real-time RT-PCR with splice-site specific primers to accurately measure the levels of individual pX mRNA species in chronically infected T cell lines. We have asked whether virus regulatory proteins or ectopic expression of cellular factors influence pX mRNA splicing in cells that were transfected with HTLV-1 provirus clones. In chronically infected cell lines, the pX-tax/rex mRNA was present at 500- to 2500-fold higher levels than the pX-tax-orfII mRNA and at approximately 1000-fold higher levels than pX-rex-orfI mRNA. Chronically infected cell lines that contain numerous defective proviruses expressed 2-exon forms of pX mRNAs at significantly higher levels compared to cell lines that contain a single full-length provirus. Cells transfected with provirus expression plasmids expressed similar relative amounts of 3-exon pX mRNAs but lower levels of 2-exon mRNA forms compared to cells containing a single, full-length provirus. The pX mRNA expression patterns were nearly identical in cells transfected with wild-type, Tax-minus, or Rex-minus proviruses. Cotransfection of cells with HTLV-1 provirus in combination with SF2/ASF expression plasmid resulted in a relative increase in pX-tax/rex mRNA compared to pX-tax-orfII and pX-rex-orfI mRNAs, but did not affect exon skipping.

Both separation procedures produced >90% CD34+/CD133+ double positive target cells. Engraftment occurred in all patients (sustained primary, n = 8; after reconditioning, n = 2). No primary acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) >/= grade II or chronic GvHD was observed. The patients showed a rapid platelet recovery (median time to independence from substitution = 13.5 d), whereas T cell regeneration was variable.

In order to facilitate the sequencing of chromosomal breakpoints, we developed an optimized set of 30 PCR primers and a new approach, designated as asymmetric multiplex PCR (am-PCR). Due to the high number of primers, small breakpoint-spanning DNA fragments are obtained in one nested multiplex PCR reaction. All PCR products contain an identical binding site for the initiation of direct sequencing. By using am-PCR, the translocation t(4;11) was examined in bone marrow and blood samples from children with acute leukaemia. Compared with previously described methods for the determination of genomic breakpoints, am-PCR may be advantageous with regard to its simplicity and rapidity.

Data from an occupational exposure matrix was also used. METHODS: The study population comprised subjects aged 16 and above who had lived in a residence situated in a broad corridor around a high-voltage power line in 1980, or one of the years from 1986 to 1996. The cases were incident cases diagnosed 1980-1996. Two controls were matched to each case by year of birth, sex, municipality and first year entering the cohort. Time-weighted average exposure to residential magnetic fields generated by the power lines was calculated for the exposure follow-up from January 1, 1967 until diagnosis using cut-off points at 0.05 and 0.20 microT. In addition, job titles and industrial branch was classified as categories of hours per week in a magnetic field above background (0.1 microT). Subjects exposures were cumulated over occupationally active years for the exposure follow-up January 1, 1955 until diagnosis. RESULTS: When residential magnetic fields are evaluated, the two upper residential time weighted average magnetic field categories showed non-significant elevated odds ratios (ORs) for all leukemia combined (OR: 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-2.5 and OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 0.8-3.0). The increased risk was confined to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic and acute myeloid leukemia. Lymphoma showed a non-significant lower OR in the upper exposure category.

The DNA microarray technology is one of the most important tools enabling the performance of such studies. The global expression analysis using microarrays enables the construction of a simultaneous expression pattern of thousands of genes and thus an unprecedented opportunity to obtain molecular signatures of the state of activity of diseased cells. Microarray analysis may thus provide invaluable information on disease pathology, progression, resistance to treatment, and response to cellular microenvironments. Ultimately such analyses may lead to improved early diagnosis and innovative therapeutic approaches. Yet, by employing this advanced technology in order to identify new target molecules for diagnosis or therapy, one is faced with the necessity to focUs on one or several genes and to investigate them further. A huge number of differentially expressed genes are usually identified when 2 cell samples are comparatively analyzed in an individual assay. Several factors, mainly a possible genetic diversity between the samples, minimize the capability of reaching an educated conclusion as to which gene or genes to select for further studies. Gene expression arrays were employed to identify genes whose expression characterizes leukemic leukocytes. Many different genes were differentially expressed by ""leukemic-phase leukocytes,"" derived from three untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients and by ""remission-phase leukocytes,"" obtained from the same patients following induction of remission. However, only two of these genes, the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase PYST2 and the tryptophan 5-hydroxylase, were found to be more highly expressed by the leukemic-phase than by remission-phase leukocytes of all three patients. The microarray results of only the PYST2 gene could be verified by RT-PCR. By focusing on genes that had a similar expression pattern in cells from multiple donors we overcame the problem of genetic diversity and identified, out of 60 differentially expressed genes, a single candidate target gene in AML. Pooling specimens in order to overcome the problem of genetic diversity (e.g., clinical material obtained from treated patients and from untreated ones), is not recommended because it may dilute the treatment effects. Therefore, it is essential to perform each experiment using individual preparations.",,"['Levy-Nissenbaum, Orlev', 'Sagi-Assif, Orit', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Ben-Bassat, Isaac', 'Witz, Isaac P']","['Levy-Nissenbaum O', 'Sagi-Assif O', 'Raanani P', 'Avigdor A', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Witz IP']","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S.

Emerging evidence suggests that angiogenesis may play an important role in hematological malignancies, such as leukemia. However, whether HHT can relieve leukemia by anti-angiogenesis is still unknown. We investigated the anti-angiogenesis potential of HHT with the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (ECV304) and leukemic cell line (K562) in vitro. Cellular proliferation was determined by MTT assay and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed by RT-PCR and VEGF protein production was detected by Western blot. Inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by HHT were discovered in ECV304 cells, and appeared in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Also, treatment with HHT caused down-regulation of VEGF mRNA expression in K562 cells in similar dose- and time-dependent manner and inhibition of VEGF protein production in K562 cells in response to the enhancing concentration of HHT. The results demonstrated that HHT could also induce apoptosis in endothelium and down-regulate VEGF expression in K562 cells.

The protein profiles are significantly different (p < 0.05) between benzene exposed and unexposed groups, as identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by Western blot analyses. T cell receptor beta chain (TCR beta), FK506-binding protein, and matrix metalloproteinase-13 were expressed only in benzene exposed workers. In addition, interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain and T cell surface glycoprotein CD1b precursor were found to be up-regulated in the plasma of benzene exposed workers. When we treated Jurkat cells with benzene (10 microM-10 mM), TCR beta expression was increased in the membrane more than 6-9-fold compared to untreated cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight hundred thirty-two patients (median age, 54 years; range, 16 to 82 years) with de novo AML were randomly assigned to receive 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, and daunorubicin (TAD) plus cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM; cytarabine 3 g/m2 [age < 60 years] or 1 g/m2 [age > or = 60 years] x 6) induction, TAD consolidation, and monthly modified TAD maintenance for 3 years, or TAD-HAM-TAD and one course of intensive consolidation with sequential HAM (S-HAM) with cytarabine 1 g/m2 (age < 60 years) or 0.5 g/m2 (age > or = 60 years) x 8 instead of maintenance. RESULTS: A total of 69.2% patients went into complete remission (CR). Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 19 months for patients on the maintenance arm, with 31.4% of patients relapse-free at 5 years, versus 12 months for patients on the S-HAM arm, with 24.7% of patients relapse-free at 5 years (P =.0118). RFS from maintenance was superior in patients with poor risk by unfavorable karyotype, age > or = 60 years, lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 700 U/L, or day 16 bone marrow blasts greater than 40% (P =.0061) but not in patients with good risk by complete absence of any poor risk factors. Although a survival benefit in the CR patients is not significant (P =.085), more surviving patients in the maintenance than in the S-HAM arm remain in first CR (P =.026).

It is not known, however, whether PML and other components of PML bodies function within the vicinity of the bodies or elsewhere in the nucleoplasm. In this study, we demonstrate that chromatin organization around PML bodies influences their morphology, dynamics, and structural integrity by a SUMO-1-independent mechanism. Following transcriptional inhibition and during early apoptosis, chromatin retracts from the periphery of PML bodies, coinciding with the formation of new PML-containing structures through fission of supramolecular PML-containing microbodies. Both fission and fusion of microbodies with parental PML bodies indicate a loss of structural integrity of the bodies, dependent on the state of the surrounding chromatin. This is supported by the observation that treatment of live cells with DNase I could reproduce the structural instability of PML bodies. In addition, PML bodies, which are normally surrounded by chromatin and are positionally stable, become more dynamic following these treatments, presumably due to the loss of chromatin contacts. Overexpression of SUMO-1, a modification required for PML body formation, did not prevent PML body fission, indicating that chromatin-based integrity of PML body structure occurs through a SUMO-1-independent mechanism.",,"['Eskiw, Christopher H', 'Dellaire, Graham', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Eskiw CH', 'Dellaire G', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['Programme in Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*physiology/ultrastructure', '*Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/12/16 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2003/12/16 05:00'],"['2003/12/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M312580200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47871-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 5;279(10):9577-85. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M312580200.

The extract also showed high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (IC50 2.4 microg/ml) and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (IC50 below 4.0 microg/ml). Furthermore, B. platyphylla var. japonica extract reduced the number of V79-4 cells arrested in G2/M in response to H2O2 treatment and increased the activities of several cellular antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Treatment with B. platyphylla var. japonica extract induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells, as shown by nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, increases in the subdiploid cell population, and fluorescence microscopy.

In order to activate naive T cells, two key signals are required. Signal one is provided through the T-cell receptor (TCR) while signal two is that of costimulation. The CD28:B7 molecules are one of the best-studied costimulatory pathways, thought to be the main mechanism through which primary T-cell stimulation occurs. However, a number of molecules have been identified which serve to amplify and diversify the T-cell response, following initial T-cell activation. These include the more recently described 4-1BB:4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) molecules. 4-1BB:4-1BBL are a member of the TNFR:TNF ligand family, which are expressed on T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), respectively. Therapies utilizing the 4-1BB:4-1BBL signaling pathway have been shown to have antitumor effects in a number of model systems. In this paper, we focus on the 4-1BB:4-1BBL costimulatory molecules.

The PCR products of Ig/TCR genes can be analyzed for clonality assessment by heteroduplex analysis or GeneScanning. The detection rate of clonal rearrangements using the BIOMED-2 primer sets is unprecedentedly high. This is mainly based on the complementarity of the various BIOMED-2 tubes. In particular, combined application of IGH (VH-JH and DH-JH) and IGK tubes can detect virtually all clonal B-cell proliferations, even in B-cell malignancies with high levels of somatic mutations. The contribution of IGL gene rearrangements seems limited. Combined usage of the TCRB and TCRG tubes detects virtually all clonal T-cell populations, whereas the TCRD tube has added value in case of TCRgammadelta(+) T-cell proliferations.

PCR-based procedures using STR analysis, especially commercially available multiplex assays, are frequently used. However, these assays have been optimized for forensic purposes and do not necessarily fulfil all needs for chimerism analysis. To improve these analyses, data on the level of informativity of STR systems in the context of chimerism analysis would be helpful. We evaluated 27 STR markers for their informativity in 203 patients and their HLA-matched related donors. These STRs included 18 from different multiplex kits, whereas nine were selected from the literature or STR databases. The STR profiles were ranked from Type 1 (not informative) to Type 5 (best suited for chimerism analysis). According to this ranking, the informativity of the STR systems was found highly variable, ranging from 4.4 to 49.0% Type 5 constellations. Among the most informative STRs were Penta E, SE33, D2S1338 and D18S51. Informativity of an STR was correlated with the degree of heterozygosity (r=0.86; P=0.0001), but not with the total number of alleles present.

We used a two-phased minisequencing strategy for monitoring chimerism after SCT. First, informative SNPs with alleles differing between donor and recipient were identified using a multiplex microarray-based minisequencing system screening 51 SNPs to ensure that multiple informative SNPs were detected in each donor-recipient pair. Secondly, the development of chimerism was followed up after SCT by sensitive, quantitative analysis of individual informative SNPs by applying the minisequencing method in a microtiter plate format. Using this panel of SNPs, we identified multiple informative SNPs in nine unrelated and in 16 related donor-recipient pairs. Samples from nine of the donor-recipient pairs taken at time points ranging from 1 month to 8 years after transplantation were available for analysis. In these samples, we monitored the allelic ratios of two or three informative SNPs in individual minisequencing reactions. The results agreed well with the data obtained by microsatellite analysis.

SET is highly conserved between species and is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting a widespread biological role. Even though SET is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation, its precise role in hematopoietic cells and the contribution of SET-CAN to leukemogenesis remains unknown. We determined the effect of tetracycline-regulatable expression of SET, a deletion mutant of SET, and SET-CAN on the human promonocytic cell line U937T. The expression of SET and SET-CAN inhibited proliferation of these cells. SET accomplishes this through the induction of the differentiation program, an effect that depends on the presence of its acidic domain.

A dose-limiting side effect of anticancer therapy in the gastrointestinal tract is mucosal barrier injury. It is hypothesised that mucosal barrier injury is initiated and amplified by proinflammatory-and NF-kappaB-regulated mediators. Therefore, the effect of NF-kappaB inhibition was studied in the onset of mucosal barrier injury. In response to cytostatic drug treatment (arabinoside cytosine (Ara-C) and methotrexate (MTX)), NF-kappaB was activated in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) resulting in an NF-kappaB-related induction of tumour necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. NF-kappaB inhibition increased the susceptibility of IEC-6 cells to Ara-C as well as MTX-induced cell death when obtained by the addition of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), but not using curcumin. In an animal model for MTX-induced mucosal barrier injury, the induction of NF-kappaB-related cytokines and chemokines was detected upon treatment with MTX. Despite increased susceptibility shown in vitro, the inhibition of NF-kappaB resulted in a partial amelioration of villous atrophy normally seen in the small intestine upon MTX treatment.

We were interested whether abnormalities of the sister-chromatid separation regulator and proto-oncogene hSecurin occurred in myeloid leukaemias, and whether such abnormalities correlated with aneuploidy.

Median hSecurin expression in AML with normal karyotypes was not significantly different from AML showing aneuploidy, CML BP or cells from healthy donors. However, hSecurin expression in CML CP was significantly increased compared to AML with normal karyotypes (1.82-fold; P<0.001), CML BP (3.18-fold; P<0.001), MNCs (3.17-fold; P<0.001) and granulocytes (2.69 fold; P<0.001) from healthy donors.

Leukemia-lymphoma cell lines have been instrumental in the cytogenetic and molecular analysis of recurring chromosome rearrangements, notably translocations and inversions, thus illuminating the pathogenesis of hematological malignancy. Chromosomal translocations targeting the MLL gene at 11q23 have come to represent a paradigm in acute leukemias. These translocations result in the in-frame joining of the MLL gene with a partner gene to generate unique fusion proteins of putatively novel function. More than 30 partner genes that participate with MLL in the more than 60 known 11q23 translocations have been reported. Cell lines provide territory to both explore the detailed structures of 11q23 translocations and investigate the leukemogenic activities of MLL fusion proteins. We review here the leukemia cell lines that have been described to carry 11q23 translocations and MLL fusion genes. Except for the t(10;11)(p12;q23), each of the following relatively frequent 11q23/MLL translocations is represented by one or more cell lines: 16 cell lines with t(4;11)(q21;q23), two cell lines with t(6;11)(q27;q23), seven cell lines with t(9;11)(p22;q23), and eight cell lines with t(11;19)(q23;p13). For each of three rare translocations, one cell line has been reported: t(5;11)(q15;q23), t(11;16)(q23;p13), and t(X;11)(q13;q23). Of these 36 cell lines with 11q23 translocations, 17 have been made available to us; we confirmed the occurrence of the alterations reported in these cell lines at the chromosomal and/or gene level. A second type of MLL gene alteration is the partial tandem duplication (PTD), which occurs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found four AML cell lines with an MLL PTD; one acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived cell line was reported to show a partial nontandem duplication. Finally, a third rearrangement involves intrachromosomal amplification of the unrearranged MLL gene leading to multiple copies of the gene and (presumably) increased expression. Three cell lines carrying such MLL amplifications have been described. The availability of these cell lines as model systems provides the opportunity to explore the altered expression or functions of MLL genes and their partners in oncogenesis.",,"['Drexler, H G', 'Quentmeier, H', 'MacLeod, R A F']","['Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H', 'MacLeod RA']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/12/13 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/12/13 05:00'],"['2003/12/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403236 [doi]', '2403236 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Feb;18(2):227-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403236.,,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,

To reveal whether Richter's syndrome occurs in CLLs with mutated or unmutated VH genes, we have performed mutational analysis on serial specimens from eight patients. CLL and DLBL tumorclones were identical in five cases and they were different in three cases. Six CLLs expressed unmutated and two cases expressed mutated VH genes.

The distribution of CD87 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) varies according to the FAB subtype (highest expression in M5 and lowest in M0). Functionally, it is conceivable that the expression of CD87 could contribute to the invasive properties of the leukemic cells towards the skin and mucosal tissues as reflected by the clinical behavior of CD87 high cases. The lack of or weaker expression of CD87 on blast cells from ALL patients supports the concept that CD87 investigation might help in the distinction of AMLs from lymphoid malignancies. Among lymphoproliferative disorders, the expression of CD87 is exclusively found in pathological plasma cells. Since plasma cells also coexpress some adhesion molecules such as CD138 and CD56, this observation is consistent with the capacity of these cells to home in the bone compartment.

This investigation examined the effect of the potent MEK inhibitor U0126 alone and in combination with Ara-C on apoptosis in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cell lines, patient acute leukemic and nonleukemic samples. Apoptosis was assessed flow cytometrically using Apo2.7 and AnnexinV antibodies which detect apoptosis at the mitochondrial and cell membrane levels, respectively. The proapoptotic effect of the inhibitor varied across the five cell lines tested, from highly significant induction of apoptosis to no apparent response. A possible synergistic effect with the combined use of U0126 and Ara-C was observed in one cell line only. The proapoptotic effect of U0126 in the most sensitive cell line appeared to be related to CD34 positivity. Cells from leukemic patients showed considerable sensitivity in two of four cases with a similar association with CD34 expression being evident. Interestingly, control cells did not show a significant effect when exposed to the inhibitor.

The generally reported trend during the last two decades has been a gradual replacement of Gram-negative bacilli by Gram-positive cocci as the major causes of bacteraemia in neutropenic hosts. However, data that are unaffected by the use of antibacterial prophylaxis are scarce. Our objective therefore was to study the incidence of bacteraemia with different microorganisms in a haematology centre where antibacterial prophylaxis has not been used during the years 1988-2001. A total of 1402 episodes of clinically significant bacteraemia in 927 patients were identified. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and had an underlying haematological disorder, with lymphoma, leukaemia, and myeloma dominating. There were 536 (58%) male, and 391 (42%) female patients, with a median age of 58 years. The dominating pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) 17%, Escherichia coli 16%, alpha-haemolytic streptococci 12%, Staphylococcus aureus 9%, Klebsiella spp 9%, Enterococcus spp 7%, and Pseudomonas spp 5%. The only significant incidence change was an increase of E. faecium bacteraemia. The balance between Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms was essentially stable over the 14-year period. The rates of antibiotic resistance were generally low and stable. Gram-negative bacteria exhibited resistance to fluoroquinolones after 1998.

However, despite high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic remissions, molecular remissions are rare. Recent work has revealed the existence of a population of Bcr-Abl-positive, quiescent hematopoietic CML stem cells that are insensitive to induction of apoptosis by imatinib ex vivo. Thus, quiescence is postulated as a mechanism of molecular resistance to imatinib. To model a cell population with reduced cell cycle activity in vitro, we applied three different established approaches to block the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary using Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to imatinib and apoptosis after 48 h of treatment was determined by analysis of activated caspase-3 and apoptotic DNA strand breaks. In these models, reduced cell cycle activity did not have a significant impact on the ability of imatinib to induce apoptosis. These data suggest that the proapoptotic activity of imatinib in vitro is not dependent on cell cycle transit.

After these cytokines bind to their respective receptor, a regulatory Smad is phosphorylated and becomes associated with Smad4, the common Smad, and the resulting complex translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription. DLX1 is the product of a member of the distal-less homeobox gene family, which is known to have important roles in embryogenesis, particularly in craniofacial development, and in GABAergic neurogenesis. DLX1 has been reported to be temporally and spatially coexpressed with BMP-4 during embryogenesis in selected contexts. We report here that, in addition to the previously reported regions/cells, DLX1 is expressed in hematopoietic cells in a lineage-dependent manner and that DLX1 interacts with Smad4 through its homeodomain. We show that it blocks multiple signals from TGF-beta superfamily cytokines such as activin A, TGF-beta1, and BMP-4, including differentiation of a hematopoietic cell line by activin A.

We report here that an aromatic ring side chain is essential to the function of residue 8. The size of the aromatic ring appears to be important, as does its ability to form a hydrogen bond. In addition, infection by all of the nonaromatic amino acid substitutions could be partially rescued by the addition of two suppressor mutations (glutamine 227 to arginine [Q227R] and aspartate 243 to tyrosine [D243Y]) or by exposure to chlorpromazine, an agent that induces fusion pores in hemifusion intermediates to complete fusion, suggesting that, like the previously described H8R mutant, the mutants reported here also arrest membrane fusion at the hemifusion state.

However, changes in a conserved SPHQ motif near the N terminus of the receptor binding subunit of a murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope protein block infection and induction of cell-cell fusion but not receptor binding. Here we report evidence that a histidine-to-arginine change at position 8 (H8R) in the SPHQ motif of Moloney MLV blocks infection by arresting virus-cell fusion at the hemifusion state. In cell-cell fusion assays, H8R envelope protein induced mixing of membrane outer leaflet lipids but did not lead to content mixing, a finding indicative of fusion pore formation. Kinetic studies of virus-cell fusion showed that lipid mixing of H8R virus membranes begins much later than for wild-type virus. The length of the delay in lipid mixing decreased upon addition of two second-site changes that increase H8R virus infection to 100-fold less than the wild-type virus. Finally, chlorpromazine, dibucaine, and trifluoperazine, agents that induce pores in an arrested hemifusion state, rescued infection by H8R virus to within 2.5-fold of the level of wild-type virus infection and cell-cell fusion to half that mediated by wild-type envelope protein. We interpret these results to indicate that fusion progressed to the hemifusion intermediate but fusion pore formation was inhibited. These results establish that membrane fusion of Moloney MLV occurs via a hemifusion intermediate.

PML NB morphology is altered or disrupted by specific viral proteins as replication proceeds. We examined whether adeno-associated virus (AAV) replication compartments also associate with PML NBs, and whether modification or disruption of these by HSV-1 or Ad, both of which are helper viruses for AAV, is necessary at all. Furthermore, to add a fourth dimension to our present view of AAV replication, we established an assay that allows visualization of AAV replication in live cells. A recombinant AAV containing 40 lac repressor binding sites between the AAV inverted terminal repeats was constructed. AAV Rep protein and helper virus-mediated replication of this recombinant AAV genome was visualized by binding of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-lac repressor fusion protein to double-stranded AAV replication intermediates. We demonstrate in live cells that AAV DNA replication occurs in compartments which colocalize with AAV Rep. Early after infection, the replication compartments were small and varied in numbers from 2 to more than 40 per cell nucleus. Within 4 to 8 h, individual small replication compartments expanded and fused to larger structures which filled out much of the cell nucleus. We also show that AAV replication compartments can associate with modified PML NBs in Ad-infected cells. In wild-type HSV-1-infected cells, AAV replication compartments and PML NBs did not coexist, presumably because PML was completely disrupted by the HSV-1 ICP0 protein. However, alteration or disruption of PML appears not to be a prerequisite for AAV replication, as the formation of replication compartments was normal when the ICP0 mutants HSV-1 dl1403 and HSV-1 FXE, which do not affect PML NBs, were used as the helper viruses; under these conditions, AAV replication compartments did not associate with PML NBs.",,"['Fraefel, Cornel', 'Bittermann, Anne Greet', 'Bueler, Hansruedi', 'Heid, Irma', 'Bachi, Thomas', 'Ackermann, Mathias']","['Fraefel C', 'Bittermann AG', 'Bueler H', 'Heid I', 'Bachi T', 'Ackermann M']","['Institute of Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. cornelf@vetvir.unizh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*DNA Replication', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Helper Viruses', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Replication Origin', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication']",2003/12/13 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/12/13 05:00'],"['2003/12/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.1.389-398.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jan;78(1):389-98. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.1.389-398.2004.,,PMC303420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated previously that atypical PKCiota is required for Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance of human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells to Taxol-induced apoptosis. Here, we report that the pattern of PKC isozyme expression characteristic of CML cells is regulated by Bcr-Abl. When Bcr-Abl was expressed in Bcr-Abl-negative HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, expression of the PKCbetaI, PKCbetaII, and PKCiota genes was induced, whereas expression of the PKCdelta gene was reduced to levels similar to those found in CML cells. Given the importance of PKCiota in Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation, we characterized the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl regulates PKCiota expression. A 1200-bp PKCiota promoter construct isolated from genomic DNA was highly active in Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cells and was activated when Bcr-Abl-negative cells were transfected with Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl-mediated induction of the PKCiota promoter was dependent upon MEK1/2 activity, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p38 MAPK activity. Mutational analysis of the PKCiota promoter revealed a region between 97 and 114 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site that is responsible for Bcr-Abl-mediated regulation. Mutation of a consensus Elk1-binding site within this region abolished Bcr-Abl-mediated regulation. We conclude that Bcr-Abl regulates PKCiota expression through the MEK-dependent activation of an Elk1 element within the proximal PKCiota promoter. Our results indicate that Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation involves transcriptional activation of the PKCiota gene, which in turn is required for Bcr-Abl-mediated chemoresistance.",,"['Gustafson, W Clay', 'Ray, Sutapa', 'Jamieson, Lee', 'Thompson, E Aubrey', 'Brasier, Allan R', 'Fields, Alan P']","['Gustafson WC', 'Ray S', 'Jamieson L', 'Thompson EA', 'Brasier AR', 'Fields AP']","['Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Jacksonville, Florida 32224, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELK1 protein, human)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C lambda)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1']",2003/12/13 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2003/12/13 05:00'],"['2003/12/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M312840200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47851-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 5;279(10):9400-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M312840200.

Leukaemias are the most frequent pediatric neoplastic diseases and 80 % are lymphoblastic (ALL). The objectives of this study are to describe the epidemiology of children with ALL in our hospital and to analyse the evolution of immunoglobulins' concentration at leukaemia's onset, during its treatment and after finishing it. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective study of patients with ALL treated with the SHOP-LAL-94 protocol. 50 patients were studied. Patients were classified in three groups: ALL- cell line B, ALL-cell line B with relapse, and ALL-cell line T. We analysed clinical data and laboratory results (IgG, IgA and IgM concentration) at leukaemia's onset, during its treatment and until 12 months after it.1. ALL-B: 44 patients. At the onset all patients, but a newborn with congenital leukaemia, had normal immunoglobulins. During treatment there was a significant decrease in immunoglobulins'concentration, being IgM the most affected (65 % of patients), followed by IgG (53 % of patients). The mean normalization time of immunoglobulins was 12 months.2. ALL-B with relapse: 7 patients. At relapse 2 patients had an IgM deficit and 1 overall immunoglobulin deficiency. During treatment there was a decrease in all immunoglobulins, which was significant for IgG. IgG and IgM decreased in all patients during relapse's treatment. There were 5 deaths, all with IgM < 186 mg/L.3. ALL-T: 6 patients, one died 3 days after diagnosis. At the onset all patients had normal immunoglobulins. Two patients had a favourable evolution, having a decrease in immunoglobulins'concentration during treatment, significant for IgM, with normalization 6 months after treatment. The rest 3 patients relapsed and died, having a global immunoglobulins'deficit during treatment and previous to death. CONCLUSIONS: At ALL's onset immunoglobulins' concentration is normal. During treatment the majority of patients have immunoglobulins' deficiency, being IgG and IgM the most affected immunoglobulins. A persistent IgM deficit is associated in our series with a higher risk of relapse and death. In patients with a good outcome immunoglobulins normalize before one year after treatment.",,"['Martin Ibanez, I', 'Arce Casas, A', 'Cruz Martinez, O', 'Estella Aguado, J', 'Martin Mateos, M A']","['Martin Ibanez I', 'Arce Casas A', 'Cruz Martinez O', 'Estella Aguado J', 'Martin Mateos MA']","['Service of Pediatrics, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu-Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr),Allergologia et immunopathologia,0370073,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agammaglobulinemia/*etiology', '*Antibody Formation', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/12/13 05:00,2004/04/23 05:00,['2003/12/13 05:00'],"['2003/12/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['13055208 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-0546(03)79203-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr). 2003 Nov-Dec;31(6):303-10. doi: 10.1016/s0301-0546(03)79203-9.,,,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,

We took advantage of the observation that antigen-specific T cells are able to penetrate tumors to design an approach delivering combined cellular and humoral therapy directly to the tumor site. To improve tumor specificity, we selected interleukin (IL)-3 as a ligand because its receptor is selectively overexpressed on myeloid leukemia progenitors. Because Bcl-2 family proteins show structural similarity to diphtheria toxin (DT), we constructed a unique retroviral IT using Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, in place of DT. Bax was chosen because several studies showed that its transduction induces lethal apoptosis in different cancers. The retroviral construct for gene therapy included IL-3 positioned downstream of its 80 amino acid leader, and permitted cotranslational protein synthesis of hybrid IL-3/human Bax fusion protein. Other vectors were constructed with IL-3 fused to DT or Pseudomonas exotoxin. Retroviral vectors were used to transiently transduce C8, a CD4(+) T cell clone that specifically recognized FBL-3, a lethal myeloid leukemia. Supernatants collected from transduced cells showed proapoptotic activity and selectively inhibited FBL-3 cells in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection of transduced but not nontransduced C8 into mice with subcutaneous tumors or systemic cancer significantly inhibited tumor growth. These results indicate that retroviral IT made with IL-3 and various toxic proteins may be useful in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Furthermore, the Bax construct may be particularly useful as a nonimmunogenic substitute for bacterial toxins in retIT.",,"['Vallera, Daniel A', 'Jin, Ni', 'Shu, Yanqun', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Kelekar, Ameeta', 'Chen, Wei']","['Vallera DA', 'Jin N', 'Shu Y', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Kelekar A', 'Chen W']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Section on Experimental Cancer Immunology, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. valle001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Immunotoxins', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/12/13 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2003/12/13 05:00'],"['2003/12/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403322611791 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Dec 10;14(18):1787-98. doi: 10.1089/104303403322611791.,,,['R01-CA82154/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome this problem, an improved retroviral vector was constructed utilizing the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) long terminal repeat (LTR), which provided a significantly higher level of transgene expression in human lymphoid cells than did MLV vectors. Nevertheless, transgene expression remained low in a large percentage of transduced cells. To address whether lymphocyte enhancer elements might improve transgene expression mediated by retroviral vectors in lymphocytes, we cloned the mouse immunoglobulin 3' kappa light chain enhancer gene (mE3') into the MPSV vector. We found that the mE3' conferred a higher, more uniform and sustained level of expression in transduced T- and B-cell lines, and in primary T cells, than did the control vector lacking this element. Integration sites were diverse and a single copy of the proviral genome was present in all examined transduced cells. The mE3' failed to enhance transgene expression in most nonlymphoid cells, indicating it is relatively lineage-specific. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the mE3' functions as a locus control region (LCR) in conferring enhanced integration-site-independent expression of a retroviral transgene.",,"['Xu, Lai', 'Tsuji, Kazuhide', 'Mostowski, Howard', 'Candotti, Fabio', 'Rosenberg, Amy']","['Xu L', 'Tsuji K', 'Mostowski H', 'Candotti F', 'Rosenberg A']","['Division of Therapeutic Proteins, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transgenes']",2003/12/13 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2003/12/13 05:00'],"['2003/12/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403322611764 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Dec 10;14(18):1753-64. doi: 10.1089/104303403322611764.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As primary myeloma cells are notoriously difficult to transduce, we conducted a comparison of various viral vectors, known to integrate the transgene of interest into the target genome, for their ability to stably promote the expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene. We compared three murine leukemia virus-based vectors, differing only in their viral envelope, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), and an adeno-associated virus type 2 vector. Transduction characteristics of these vectors were evaluated in human myeloma cell lines and in primary myeloma cells. Unequivocally, we observed that the VSV-G/HIV vector was the most efficient vector for transducing the cell lines and the only one able to transduce primary myeloma cells reproducibly. The mean percentage of transduced primary myeloma cells was 43.6% (range, 16.3-77.6%), with one round of infection at a low multiplicity of infection, including MM cell samples with less than 1% of cells in the S phase.

LPA is known to activate at least three different subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors can then stimulate different kinds of G proteins. In the present study, LPA and LPA analogs were synthesized from (R)- and (S)-glycidol and used to characterize the ability to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in fura-2-acetoxymethylester-loaded human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. Furthermore, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to characterize LPA receptor subtypes expressed in HEL cells. The results show that HEL cells mainly express LPA1 and LPA2, although LPA3 might possibly be expressed as well. Moreover, LPA and its analogs concentration-dependently increased [Ca2+]i in HEL cells. The response involved both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This is the first time the unnatural (S)-enantiomer of LPA, (S)-3-O-oleoyl-1-O-phosphoryl-glycerol, has been synthesized and studied according to its ability to activate cells. The results indicate that this group of receptors does not discriminate between (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of LPA and its analogs. When comparing ether analogs having different hydrocarbon chain lengths, the tetradecyl analog (14 carbons) was found to be the most effective in increasing [Ca2+]i. Pertussis toxin treatment of the HEL cells resulted in an even more efficient Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by LPA and its analogs. Furthermore, at repeated incubation with the same ligand no further increase in [Ca2+]i was obtained. When combining LPA with the ether analogs no suppression of the new Ca2+ signal occurred.

In addition, the authors determined whether subdivision of the hypodiploid category served a prognostic purpose for these patients. METHODS: The authors evaluated the cytogenetic records of 979 patients with ALL admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN) between 1984 and 1999. RESULTS: Of 67 patients (6.8%) whose leukemic cells contained a modal number (MN) of chromosomes less than or equal to 45 (i.e., hypodiploid leukemic cells), 57 had an MN of 45 and 10 had an MN of less than 45. In 19 patients, cells with an MN of 45 had a whole chromosome missing (42%), which was a sex chromosome in 12 patients (63%). Leukemic cells with an MN of 45 contained dicentric chromosomes (n = 33) formed from chromosome 9p (55%), 12p (18%), or both (21%). The ETV6-CBFA2 fusion was present in 39% of 28 evaluable B-lineage cases with an MN of 45. The event-free survival rate (EFS) for patients with hypodiploid leukemic cells of MN less than 45 (5-year EFS = 20.0% +/- 10.3%) was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than that for patients with leukemic cells of MN greater than or equal to 45 (5-year EFS = 74.9% +/- 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Low hypodiploidy (MN < 45) should be recognized as a high-risk feature in pediatric ALL. Only two hypodiploid groups (MN < 45 and MN = 45) may be necessary in prognostic assessments.",['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],"['Raimondi, Susana C', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Mathew, Susan', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Raimondi SC', 'Zhou Y', 'Mathew S', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Behm FG', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. susana.raimondi@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11841 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Dec 15;98(12):2715-22. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11841.,,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-one patients received alemtuzumab 3 times weekly for 4 weeks. The first 24 patients received 10 mg per dose, and the next 17 patients received 30 mg. All patients received infection prophylaxis during therapy and for 2 months after treatment. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 46%, including 39% of patients who received the 10 mg dose and responded versus 56% of the patients who received the 30 mg dose. The major reason for failure to respond was the presence of adenopathy. Residual bone marrow disease cleared in most patients, and 11 of 29 patients (38%) achieved a molecular disease remission. The median time to disease progression had not been reached in responders with a median follow-up of 18 months. Six patients remained in disease remission between 24-38 months after therapy. Infusion-related events were common with the initial doses, but all such events were NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1-2. Infections were reported to occur in 15 patients (37%), and 9 of these infections were reactivation of cytomegalovirus. Three patients developed Epstein-Barr virus positive, large cell lymphoma. Two patients had spontaneous resolution of the lymphoma and, in one patient, the lymphoma resolved after treatment with cidofovir and immunoglobulin. CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab produced significant responses in patients with residual disease after chemotherapy.

However, to our knowledge, there are few data regarding imatinib safety, efficacy, and response monitoring in patients age < 18 years. METHODS: In the current series, the authors report 5 consecutive patients ages 20 months to 12 years with Ph+ leukemia who were treated with imatinib and evaluated for a response using cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on serial bone marrow aspirations. Doses of imatinib were escalated as tolerated from a starting dose of 400 mg/m2 (patients with a body surface area [BSA] < 1 m2) or 400 mg/day (patients with a BSA > 1 m2). RESULTS: After the initiation of imatinib therapy, all 4 patients with CML were found to have no detectable Ph chromosome by cytogenetics (median of 198 days of imatinib therapy; range, 138-346 days), FISH (median of 285 days of imatinib therapy; range, 138-366 days), and real-time RT-PCR (median of 287 days of imatinib therapy; range, 224-366 days). One patient with Ph+ acute mixed lineage leukemia achieved a morphologic disease remission with standard chemotherapy, but within 10 months had increasing Ph positivity in consecutive bone marrow aspirations. Imatinib was added to the intensive leukemia therapy, and within 26 days there were no detectable Ph+ cells in the bone marrow. Mild thrombocytopenia was noted in two patients and transient mild hepatic toxicity was noted in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib mesylate was found to be effective in inducing undetectable residual disease in a small cohort of pediatric patients with Ph+ leukemia.

This was most likely because approximately 90% of patients receiving IFN-alpha plus ara-C changed to imatinib therapy after a median of 8 months into therapy. METHODS: The authors analyzed the results with imatinib therapy in patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive CML in chronic phase and compared their outcome with patients who received IFN-alpha regimens. A total of 187 patients with Ph-positive CML in early chronic phase treated with imatinib were compared with a historic group of 650 similar patients treated with IFN-alpha regimens from 1982 until 1997. RESULTS: Patients who received imatinib were significantly older and had significantly more bone marrow basophilia and less leukocytosis. The complete cytogenetic response (Ph 0%) rates were better with imatinib (81% vs. 32%; P < 0.001), as were the survival rates (30-month estimated survival rates 98% vs. 88%; P = 0.01). A multivariate analysis of the total study group of 837 patients identified imatinib therapy to be a significant independent favorable prognostic factor for survival (P = 0.01).

METHODS: HRX-EEN fusion gene was constructed by use of three different DNA fragments, and it was inserted into hCG transgenic vector. G(0) transgenic mice were obtained by microinjection of the recombined DNA into the pronucleus of zygotes, followed by implantation of the injected zygotes into pseudopregnant mice. The integration of the transgene was tested by PCR and its expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The sequence of recombined HRX-EEN gene was confirmed by sequencing. PCR testing revealed a total of 7 G(0) transgenic mice, these mice were then mated with C57 wild type mice.

METHODS: A FISH assay was performed to analyze 70 AML/MDS patients who had received conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA). The dual color probes CEP 7 labeled by SpectrumGreen and D7S486 (locus at 7q31) labeled by SpectrumOrange were used. RESULTS: The incidence of -7/7q- in AML and MDS patients was 4.51% (31 out of 687 cases) and 5.71% (28 out of 490 cases), respectively, and was 5.68% and 10.29% in these patients with abnormal karyotype, respectively. The common deletion region of 7q- was 7q21a222 (ten cases) and 7q31-35(ten cases). FISH assay confirmed the -7/7q- aberration in those with clonal -7/7q- abnormalities, but failed in those with random -7/7q- and normal karyotype. In 7q- group, FISH revealed seven of eleven cases with monosomy 7 clone detected in the same specimen, but the numbers of 7q- interphases cells were much greater than those of monosomy 7 cells (average 42.5% vs 8.4%, P=0.025). FISH also provided precise refinement for three chromosomal structural abnormalities associated with 7q seen in CAA, one case with del(7)(q22) being refined as chromosomal translocation, one case with 7q+ being confirmed as dup(7q), and one case with complex translocation involving 7q being also proved to be true. CONCLUSION: FISH is a powerful tool to identify or refine chromosomal structural aberrations involving 7q, and it provides accurate evaluation of -7/7q- in all the patients. -7 and 7q- clone frequently coexist in the same specimen, and the significantly increasing percentage of 7q- cells implies that -7 clone secondary to 7q- clone is a result from loss of 7q-.",,"['Xiao, Yun', 'Liu, Shi-he', 'Liu, Xu-ping', 'Qin, Shuang', 'Bo, Li-jin', 'Li, Cheng-wen', 'Dai, Yun', 'Wang, Ji-shi']","['Xiao Y', 'Liu SH', 'Liu XP', 'Qin S', 'Bo LJ', 'Li CW', 'Dai Y', 'Wang JS']","['Department of Clinical Hematological Examinations, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550001 PR China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['940620126 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Dec;20(6):471-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several randomized trials have failed to identify major differences in survival between any of these doublets. This lack of evidence for improvement in survival with any chemotherapy regimen has created a tabula rasa in which no more large randomized trials should be conducted with out including a genetic analysis. Patients see survival as their major concern, and other considerations, such as cost of treatment and qualify of life, are relegated to lower positions. Genetic alterations related to the transcription-coupled repair pathway of the nucleotide excision repair system (TC-NER) have revealed the subset of patients who are resistant to cisplatin. TC-NER involves genes that are deficient in rare inborn disorders such as Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum. For a long time, ERCC1 mRNA levels have been known to correlate with DNA repair capacity in various tissues. Levels of DNA cisplatin adducts in peripheral blood and buccal mucosa cells predict chemotherapy response, and high ERCC1 mRNA levels have been related to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and in malignant lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover , in some instances, mRNA expression has been correlated with polymorphisms. Overexpression of ERCC1 correlates with poor survival gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated non-small cell lung cancer patients. An ongoing customized ERCC1-based chemotherapy trial has been established on this knowledge. Patients are randomized to the control arm of cisplatin/docetaxel is combined with cisplatin or gemcitabine according to ERCC1 levels. To date, 80 patients have been included. At the preclinical level, ERCC1 and XPD mRNA expression correlate with each other, and overexpression of XPD causes selective cisplatin resistance in human tumor cell lines. Some XPD polymorphisms have been associated with lower DNA repair capacity. In our experience, time to disease progression is significantly higher in gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated patients with the Lys751Gln genotype (9.6 months) than in those with the Lys751Lys genotype (4.2 months; p = 0.03). Other polymorphisms involved in parallel DNA repair systems may well provide the same information, indicating a high degree of biological redundancy. The overexpression of the subunit M1 of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1) has been linked to gemcitabine resistance in our retrospective assessment. Preliminary findings indicate that a subset of gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated patients with low ERCC1 and RRM1 mRNA levels show a significantly longer survival. This highlights the possibilities of individually tailored chemotherapy. However, in patients treated with cisplatin/vinorelbine, the opposite effect has been observed. Patients with Lys751Lys had a longer time to progression. When docetaxel was added to gemcitabine/cisplatin, patients with Lys751Lys also had better survival. Our findings indicate that TC-NER status can help to decide between cisplatin/gemcitabine and docetaxel/ cisplatin. TC-NER-dependent activity is similar to other anticancer agents that cause DNA-binding enzymes to kill cells (topoisomerase inhibitors). At least 50% of non-small cell lung cancer patients harbor Lys751Lys and can benefit from docetaxel/ cisplatin treatment. Genes involved in spindle formation, centrosome functions and mRNA transport along the microtubule tracks should provide further information on potential markers of docetaxel resistance.",,"['Rosell, Rafael', 'Taron, Miquel', 'Camps, Carlos', 'Lopez-Vivanco, Guillermo']","['Rosell R', 'Taron M', 'Camps C', 'Lopez-Vivanco G']","['Medical Oncology Service, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain. rrosell@ns.hugtip.scs.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Drugs Today (Barc),"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",101160518,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein)', 'EC 5.99.- (ERCC2 protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/*mortality', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Adducts/metabolism', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/genetics', 'Survival Rate', '*Transcription Factors', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/06/15 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['799471 [pii]', '10.1358/dot.2003.39.10.799471 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Today (Barc). 2003 Oct;39(10):775-86. doi: 10.1358/dot.2003.39.10.799471.,,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukins, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-15, heavily influence lymphocyte survival during the vulnerable stages of VDJ rearrangement and later in ensuring cellular homeostasis, but the genes specifically responsible for the development and maintenance of lymphocytes have not been identified. The antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 is an attractive candidate, as it is highly regulated, appears to enhance short-term survival and functions at an apical step in genotoxic deaths. However, Mcl-1 deficiency results in peri-implantation lethality. Here we show that mice conditional for Mcl-1 display a profound reduction in B and T lymphocytes when MCL-1 is removed. Deletion of Mcl-1 during early lymphocyte differentiation increased apoptosis and arrested the development at pro-B-cell and double-negative T-cell stages. Induced deletion of Mcl-1 in peripheral B- and T-cell populations resulted in their rapid loss. Moreover, IL-7 both induced and required MCL-1 to mediate lymphocyte survival.

Their use in differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) represents a model concept for reprogramming cancer cells. However, they also regulate antiproliferative genes whose functions do not mechanistically concur to this program. Recently, we have shown that, independently of maturation, a long-term all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of the maturation-resistant APL cell line (NB4-LR1) represses telomerase (hTERT), leading to telomere shortening and death. Using retinoid-receptor-specific agonists, we demonstrate herein that cross-talk between RARalpha and RXR dual-liganded to their respective agonists resulted in strong synergistic downregulation of hTERT and subsequent cell death. Importantly, unlike ATRA, this synergy was obtained at very low agonist concentrations and occurred in other ATRA maturation-resistant APL cells. These findings provide the first demonstration that dual-liganded RXR and RARalpha signaling should allow efficient targeting of telomerase in differentiation-resistant tumor cells. Such a combination therapy might hold promise in clinic to avoid side effects of ATRA whose administration can indiscriminately activate all RARs.

In vitro studies with the APL-derived NB4 cell line showed that As2O3 exerts a dose-dependent dual effect, which induces apoptosis at 1 microM, whereas at a lower concentration of 0.1 microM, a partial differentiation of APL is observed. In non-APL cells, interferon (IFN) alpha and 1 microM As2O3 act synergistically to induce apoptosis. In this report, we show that in NB4 cells and in two RA-resistant NB4-derived cell lines, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2, IFNalpha or IFNgamma combined with 0.1 microM As2O3 lead to an increased maturation effect. Moreover, IFNgamma alone is able to differentiate RA-sensitive and -resistant cells with a higher maturation effect on NB4-R2 cells. In contrast, all these cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of the cytokine and a higher concentration of As2O3. IFNgamma boosted As2O3-induced apoptosis in APL cells as tested by TUNEL, Annexin V staining and activation of caspase 3. As2O3 differently altered IFN-induced gene products; it downregulated PML/RARalpha and PML, did not alter PKR and Stat1, and upregulated interferon regulatory family (IRF)-1. Synergism by IFNgamma and arsenic on IRF-1 expression is mediated by a composite element in the IRF-1 promoter that includes an IFNgamma-activation site (GAS) overlapped by a nonconsensus site for nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). Arsenic has no effect on NFkappaB, whereas it enhances the activation of Stat1 by IFNgamma in NB4 cells leading to an increase in IRF-1 expression.",,"['Chelbi-alix, Mounira K', 'Bobe, Pierre', 'Benoit, Gerard', 'Canova, Antony', 'Pine, Richard']","['Chelbi-alix MK', 'Bobe P', 'Benoit G', 'Canova A', 'Pine R']","['UPR9045, Institut Lwoff, 7 rue Guy Moquet, 94801 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207090 [doi]', '1207090 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Dec 11;22(57):9121-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the example of a newly diagnosed ITP patient, the author attempts to answer the question of whether a bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is required prior to starting steroids. Using decision analysis methodology, the author determines that BMA is not essential prior to starting steroids. More importantly, three variables critical to the decision-making process are determined: the risk of death from the BMA procedure, the altered chance of survival for a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) inappropriately given steroids, and how sensitive the complete blood count is at determining the risk of ALL.

Of the many suggested approaches, the method of emerging patterns (EPs) has the particular advantage of explicitly modeling interactions among genes, which improves classification accuracy. However, finding useful (i.e. short and statistically significant) EP is typically very hard. METHODS: Here we introduce a CART-based approach to discover EPs in microarray data. The method is based on growing decision trees from which the EPs are extracted. This approach combines pattern search with a statistical procedure based on Fisher's exact test to assess the significance of each EP. Subsequently, sample classification based on the inferred EPs is performed using maximum-likelihood linear discriminant analysis. RESULTS: Using simulated data as well as gene expression data from colon and leukemia cancer experiments we assessed the performance of our pattern search algorithm and classification procedure. In the simulations, our method recovers a large proportion of known EPs while for real data it is comparable in classification accuracy with three top-performing alternative classification algorithms. In addition, it assigns statistical significance to the inferred EPs and allows to rank the patterns while simultaneously avoiding overfit of the data. The new approach therefore provides a versatile and computationally fast tool for elucidating local gene interactions as well as for classification.

Diabetic neuropathy shows slower impulse conduction, axonal degeneration, and impaired regeneration. Diabetic neuropathy affects peripheral, central, and visceral sensorimotor and motor nerves, causing improper locomotor and visceral organ dysfunctions. The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy is complex and involves multiple pathways. Lack of success in preventing neuropathy, even with successful treatment of hyperglycemia, suggests the presence of early mediators between hyperglycemia-induced metabolic and enzymatic changes and functional and structural properties of Schwann cells (SCs) and axons. It is feasible that once activated, such mediators can act independently of the initial metabolic stimulus to modulate SC-axonal communication. Neuropoietic cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), exhibit pleiotrophic effects on homeostasis of glia and neurons in central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system. These cytokines are produced locally by resident and infiltrating macrophages, lymphocytes, mast cells, SCs, fibroblasts, and sensory neurons. Metabolic changes induced by hyperglycemia lead to dysregulation of cytokine control.

Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue which can directly suppress Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. We reviewed our combined experience to evaluate the role of lamivudine as prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients who were HBsAg carriers treated with chemotherapy between July 2000 and October 2002 at the Numune Education and Research Hospitals (Ankara, Turkey) retrospectively. METHODS: We investigated 75 acute leukemia patients who received chemotherapy. Thirteen (17.3%) of 75 acute leukemia patients were HbsAg positive and of 7 (53.3%) were HBV DNA positive. Two patients (patients 5 and 6) had a chemotherapy regimen that included corticosteroids and were HBsAg and HBV DNA negative but anti HBc total positive. HBsAg positive patients with or without HBV DNA positivity were treated with a dose of 100 mg/day lamivudine commencing when chemotherapy was initiated. Lamivudine started at the beginning of chemotherapy and was maintained for 6 months following the cessation of chemotherapy. During lamivudine treatment, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Gama glutamile transpeptidase (GGT), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were followed. RESULTS: Of the 8 patients who presented with hepatic dysfunction during the first chemotherapy cycle, 4 improved during the second course. After completing chemotherapy, the levels of hepatic enzymes were in the normal range in all but one patient. With lamivudune prophylaxis, HBV DNA positivity did not develop in any of the HBV DNA negative patients. The two patients who received corticosteroids with their first chemotherapy cycle became positive for HBsAg and HBV DNA and were given Lamivudine when the seroconversion was established. Median follow up from the diagnosis of leukemia was 14.5 months. Survival rate at the end of follow up was 5 (38%) for the 13 patients. CONCLUSIONS: As this infection is endemic in our country and the exposure to blood products is high in these patients, HBV infection is more common. Prophylaxis with daily administration of lamivudine to HBsAg carriers who are candidates for chemotherapy seems to be effective and may prevent chemotherapy induced HBV reactivation and hepatic failure.",,"['Yilmaz, Mehmet', 'Dagdas, Simten', 'Guler, Nil', 'Aki, Sahika Zeynep', 'Akoz, Ayla Gokmen', 'Ozet, Gulsum', 'Ayli, Meltem', 'Saritas, Ulku']","['Yilmaz M', 'Dagdas S', 'Guler N', 'Aki SZ', 'Akoz AG', 'Ozet G', 'Ayli M', 'Saritas U']","['Department of Hematology, Ankara Numune Education and Research Hospital, Samanpazari 06100, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/blood/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/*blood', 'Hepatitis B virus/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2003/12/12 05:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330310001594234 [doi]', '2MU0VC0BTDLPDC2V [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2003 Dec;8(6):393-6. doi: 10.1080/10245330310001594234.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concentration of 10 microM mahanine caused a complete inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in a time dependent manner. Mahanine-induced cell death was characterized with the changes in nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase like activities, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, release of cytochrome c into cytosol and stimulation of reactive oxygen species generation. The cell death was completely prevented by a pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-L-aspart-1-yl-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy]methane (Z-Asp-CH(2)-DCB). Mahanine activated various caspases such as caspase-3, -6, -8 and -9 (like) activities but not caspase-1 like activity. More than 70% cell survival was observed in the presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor. In addition, co-treatment of cyclosporin A markedly increased the survival of mahanine-treated HL-60 cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that mahanine decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential of intact cells, and disrupted cell cycle progression by increasing the number of cells in sub-diploid region, concomitantly with the decrease of cells in diploid phases, particularly at late hours of apoptosis. The overall results suggest that mahanine down regulates cell survival factors by activation of caspase-3 through mitochondrial dependent pathway, and disrupts cell cycle progression.",,"['Roy, Molay Kumar', 'Thalang, Vipaporn Na', 'Trakoontivakorn, Gassinee', 'Nakahara, Kazuhiko']","['Roy MK', 'Thalang VN', 'Trakoontivakorn G', 'Nakahara K']","['Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), 1-1 Owashi, Tsukuba, 305-8686, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (acetyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartal)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene)', '0 (mahanine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/01/30 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203006233 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2003.07.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Jan 1;67(1):41-51. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.07.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated 87 (61 male) patients with FUO using the criteria of Petersdorf and Beeson [Medicine 40 (1961) 1] hospitalized between January 1994 and August 2002 at Cukurova University Hospital. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 38.5 years (range: 14-80 years). Eleven patients (12.6%) were over 65. The mean duration of hospitalization was 22.5+/-13 days. Infectious diseases were the most common causes of FUO. Tuberculosis (n=15, 17.2%), infective endocarditis (n=6), abdominal abscess (n=6), brucellosis (n=5), urinary tract infection (n=5), visceral leishmaniasis (n=4), salmonellosis (n=3), rhinocerebral mucormycosis (n=4), atypical pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, Cytomegalovirus infection or encephalitis were diagnosed in 51 (58.6%) patients. The second most common causes of FUO were collagen vascular diseases (n=16, 18.3%) determined as vasculitis syndrome, adult Still's disease (n=4), systemic lupus erythematosus, Behcet's disease, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. Neoplasm was found in 12 (13.7%) patients; (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal tract carcinoma, glioma). Miscellaneous diseases thyroiditis, granulomatous hepatitis were diagnosed in two (2.2%) patients. On admission, six patients (6.8%) were neutropenic. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis, were the leading diagnostic category of FUO in this study. Adult Still's disease was more common than expected.

METHODS: Literature search of PubMed documented publications and abstracts from meetings. RESULTS: Preclinical data in prostate cancer shows upregulation of a wide variety of growth factors and their receptors such as PDGF, EGF, IGF, FGF, and VEGF suggesting efficacy of agents targeting these pathways. Here the preclinical evidence and first clinical data on the use of growth signal targeting in prostate cancer is reviewed. Although some anticancer efficacy of signal transduction inhibition monotherapy was reported, combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy seemed most promising in prostate cancer.

The expression of those molecules may alter the adhesive qualities (mobility and homing) as well as immune response behavior of leukemic blasts. L-Selectin (CD62L) is suggested to play a role in the redistribution and homing of hemopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow (BM). Down-regulation of L-selectin is responsible for mobilization of blasts from the BM into the circulation and ligation of L-selectin stimulates proliferation of progenitor cells. This could have an influence on the process of leukemia. METHOD: We have studied the expression of L-selectin on mononuclear BM cells of 36 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients at first diagnosis by FACS analysis using a directly fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated antibody (clone DRE G56). RESULTS: On average the patients presented with 88% blasts in the BM. The expression tended to be higher in primary (p) AML compared with secondary (s) AML. L-Selectin was very heterogenously expressed in all FAB groups. Highest expression was found in cases with AML-M4 with four of nine cases presenting with an inv(16) karyotype. Separating our patient cohort in cytogenetic risk groups we could detect a significantly higher expression of L-selectin in cases with a 'good risk' karyotype and a very low expression in cases with a 'bad risk' karyotype (P = 0.037). Comparing patients who achieved remission after double induction therapy (responders) with patients who showed persisting disease (non-responders) we found a higher percentage of L-selectin+ cases or cells in the responder group than in the non-responder group, although the differences were not significant because of only five cases in the 'non-responder' group. Evaluating cut-off points greatest differences in relapse-free survival probabilities were found in patients who presented with > or = 30% L-selectin+ BM cells compared with cases with < 30%: 86% of cases with > or = 30% L-selectin+ cells were still in remission after a mean follow up time of only 8 months compared with only 46% in the group with < 30% L-selectin+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that (i) expression of L-selectin on AML blasts is variable. This reveals the great diversitiy of immunophenotypes in AML and might contribute to identify individual blast phenotypes in order to detect minimal residual disease in remission. (ii) Low L-selectin expression correlates with a bad cytogenetic risk, with a lower probability to achieve remission and with a shorter relapse-free survival time. This might reflect a decreased homing of the blasts to the BM as well as an impaired cytotoxic T-cell reaction against leukemic cells. The expression of L-selectin on leukemic blasts might be influenced by different cytokine therapies (e.g. with interferon alpha) and this might result in an altered hematologic reconstitution after cytotoxic therapies as well as in an altered immunologic recognition of blasts.",,"['Graf, M', 'Reif, S', 'Hecht, K', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Pfister, K', 'Nuessler, V', 'Schmetzer, H']","['Graf M', 'Reif S', 'Hecht K', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Pfister K', 'Nuessler V', 'Schmetzer H']","['Medical Department III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*deficiency', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00140.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Nov;71(5):366-76. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00140.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antineoplastic activity of TT-232 has been found to be associated with induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in tumor cell, resulting in highly selective elimination of neoplastic tissue. The aim of this study was the therapeutic efficacy of TT-232 on different human models: PC-3 prostate carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 (ER-) and MCF-7 (ER+) breast carcinoma, HT-29 colon carcinoma, HT-18 melanoma, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia. We studied the therapeutic efficacy of the novel somatostatin analog, it for 30 days with intermittent injection once daily and for 14 days with s.c. infusion using the Alzet osmotic minipump (model 2002). The antitumor activity of TT-232 was evaluated on the basis of survival time and tumor growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of TT-232 on human tumor xenografts proved to be significant, resulting in 30%-80% decrease in tumor volume and in 20-60% tumor free animals. This antitumor efficacy of the novel somatostatin analog was observable in almost all tumors investigated.

Some blood CLL cells of these patients have been infected and carry Epstein Barr virus (EBV) in vivo. In spite of their early-activated G0/G1 stage of post germinal center (GC) memory cells, ex vivo EBV-carrying blood CLL cells of PG clone expressed LMPs and used specific QUK splice for their EBNA1 expression, similar to the EBV-carrying cells of non-B origin. Interestingly, EBV-carrying CLL cells of NN clone expressed LMP2a and used UK-splice for their EBNA1 expression, similar to the in vivo EBV-carrying high density normal B cells in the blood of healthy individuals. The CLL-derived lines but not normal lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) used QUK- and YUK-splice for their EBNA1 expression. As expected, LCL and their permanent CLL-derived lines used Cp promoter and up-regulated their EBNA2 expression. Blood CLL cells and the CLL-derived cell lines of these patients spontaneously produced cytokines as shown by microarray assay. The types and quantities of cytokines might relate to their CLL origin and viral strain in the given CLL cells. Neither blood CLL nor their CLL-derived cell lines express any detectable apoptosis-inducer ligands, CD95L or Apo 3L. As a consequence of cell cycle progression, CLL-derived cell lines up-regulated their co-stimulator molecules CD80 and apoptosis-related receptor CD95.

The results obtained with a fluorescence in situ hybridisation method were quantified using the Scion image software program and compared with cytochemical and cytophotometric data relating to DHFR activity. In AL a heterogeneous hybridisation pattern was generally observed at the single cell level. However, leukemic lymphoblasts showed higher fluorescence signal intensity of the DHFR gene as compared with normal lymphocytes, and leukemic myeloblasts a much higher signal than lymphoblasts. HeLa cells showed the highest fluorescence signal intensity. In all samples enzyme activity behaved in parallel.

This finding paved the way to investigating the interaction between NaF and the oral environment. As an initial step, we investigated redox compounds, metals and saliva, which may modify the cytotoxic activity of NaF against a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HSC-2). The minimum exposure time to NaF required for cytotoxicity induction was 8 hours. Noncytotoxic concentrations of antioxidants (sodium ascorbate, gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, chlorogenic acid, curcumin, superoxide dismutase, catalase), oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite), metals (CuCl, CuCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3, CoCl2) or saliva neither protected against, nor enhanced the cytotoxic activity of NaF. Cytotoxic concentrations of these compounds produced somewhat additive, but not synergistic, effects on the cytotoxicity of NaF. ESR analysis demonstrated that NaF did not apparently change the radical intensity of sodium ascorbate and gallic acid, measured under alkaline conditions. During the cell death induction in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by NaF, the consumption of glucose rapidly declined, followed by a decline in the consumption of major amino acids.

One of these genes, which is overexpressed, is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3). IP3R3 is responsible for the intracellular Ca2+ release channel and for mobilizing stored Ca2+. Three different receptor types have been molecularly cloned and their genes have been classified into a family. However, the role of the IP3 signaling pathway in the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer is still unclear. In the study presented here, the IP3R3 is showed to be overexpressed in gastric cancer cell lines established from malignant ascites, but weakly expressed in a gastric cancer cell line established from primary tumor as well as normal gastric epithelial cells. IP3R1 and 2 are only weakly or not expressed in these cells. The antagonist of IP3R, 2APB, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells from malignant ascites at concentrations of 100 nM to 100 microM in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, 2APB showed a weak effect on other gastric cancer cells established from primary tumors (SNU1), lymph node metastases or liver metastases (MKN1 or 74), methothelial cell lines Met5A and myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. This suggests that this inhibitory effect depends on the level of IP3R3 expression. As cells which express IP3R3 mRNA (i.e. pancreas ascinar cells) are known to have a secretory function in which IP3/Ca2+ signaling has been shown to be involved, IP3R3 may be a prerequisite for secretion of an enzyme, such as protease, in gastric cancer cells. These results indicate that IP3R3 may be specifically involved in gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination and that IP3R3 may be a molecular target of the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer. Its antagonist, 2APB, may thus be useful for the specific treatment of peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer.",,"['Sakakura, Chouhei', 'Hagiwara, Akeo', 'Fukuda, Kenichiro', 'Shimomura, Katsumi', 'Takagi, Tsuyoshi', 'Kin, Shuichi', 'Nakase, Yuenn', 'Fujiyama, Junshin', 'Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko', 'Okazaki, Yasushi', 'Yamagishi, Hisakazu']","['Sakakura C', 'Hagiwara A', 'Fukuda K', 'Shimomura K', 'Takagi T', 'Kin S', 'Nakase Y', 'Fujiyama J', 'Mikoshiba K', 'Okazaki Y', 'Yamagishi H']","['Department of Digestive Surgery, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kawaramachi-dori, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', 'E4ES684O93 (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*secondary', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",2003/12/12 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/12/12 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 Sep-Oct;23(5A):3691-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of chemotherapeutic agents is still the mainstay of anti-leukemia therapy. Despite this, significant morbidity and mortality still occurs. We describe herein novel apoptotic effects of PBT-3, one of a family of stable analogs of the Hepoxilins, natural products derived from arachidonic acid. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibition of [3H]-thymidine incorporation, nuclear fragmentation, DNA laddering, FACS analysis as well as Annexin V binding were assessed. RESULTS: PBT-3 dose-dependently causes apoptosis of the CML cell line, K562, in vitro. PBT-3 acts by increasing cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm and by activation of caspase-3 degradation. The effects of PBT-3 compare favorably with those of STI571 (Gleevec), while thromboxane agonists and antagonists are without effect.

SETTING: Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-three children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied, with the examination of 83 bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis, four obtained also during relapse, and two cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from two cases of isolated relapse in the central nervous system. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Homologous deletion of the p15 gene by multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and screening for point mutations by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformational polymorphism. RESULTS: Deletion of exon 2 of the p15 gene was observed in 15 children, including one case in which deletion was only verified during isolated central nervous system relapse. No case of exon 1 deletion, or that was suggestive of point mutations, was observed and no association between p15 gene inactivation and classic risk factors was established. CONCLUSION: According to the literature, inactivation of the p15 gene by deletion of exon 2 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia found in the population studied would be considered to be a molecular marker for diagnosis or relapse.

Evidence derived from experiments in vitro and from animal systems suggest a direct impact of the embryo on endometrial differentiation and the implantation process itself. Being one of the earliest embryonic products, hCG may be a key mediator of this embryo-maternal communication. Using a multiplex nested rT-PCR approach we have been able to demonstrate the presence of full-length and truncated hCG/LH-receptor mRNA in human endometrium and in decidua. The expression of functional receptors appears to be cycle-dependent and regulated by changes in the alternative splicing pattern. To investigate possible direct effects of hCG on endometrial paracrinology in the human female in vivo, we have developed an intrauterine microdialysis system that allows the continuous sampling from the uterine cavity over several hours as well as the application of exogenous hCG and the monitoring of the tissue response to this stimulus. HCG administration during the secretory phase significantly modulated several endometrial paracrine parameters that correlate to endometrial differentiation (IGFBP-1), angiogenesis (VEGF), implantation (LIF, M-CSF) and tissue remodelling (MMP-9). In summary, intrauterine microdialysis is a novel tool for the clinical assessment of endometrial paracrinology in vivo.

For several decades, the most common transfusion trigger was 20,000/microL, but the trend is now to use 10,000/microL in the absence of other risk factors for bleeding. This trigger seems to reduce the number of transfusions without increasing the risk of severe bleeding. Most studies involved in establishing platelet transfusion policies have involved patients with acute leukemia, with fewer studies involving patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or aggressive chemotherapy for other cancers and patients with aplastic anemia. In the presence of other risk factors for spontaneous bleeding, 20,000/microL is still considered an appropriate trigger. The trigger for prophylactic transfusion before surgery has not undergone the same recent scrutiny as has the trigger for spontaneous bleeding. The recommendation remains to raise the platelet count to 50,000 to 100,000/microL if possible, although it is recognized that surgery and other invasive procedures have been performed at lower platelet counts without major bleeding. Prophylactic transfusion is not used in disorders of platelet consumption and destruction to prevent spontaneous bleeding but is used before surgery. Because of the comparative lack of experience with platelet transfusion in veterinary medicine, it is difficult to make generalizations for dogs and cats. Using the guidelines established for therapeutic and prophylactic transfusion of human patients is a reasonable starting point, however. A therapeutic transfusion policy is suggested in the veterinary setting provided that the patient can be closely observed for critical bleeding and a prompt transfusion can be given. This policy should ultimately reduce the overall number of platelet transfusions given to hospital patients. If an animal cannot be closely observed or the ability to transfuse on demand is limited, prophylactic transfusion is recommended. The triggers for initiating a platelet transfusion in dogs are extrapolated from human data; these values are lower by 50% for cats. Because of the imprecision of platelet counting at low values, platelet counts must always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical signs of hemorrhage. If platelet-rich plasma or platelet concentrate is available, a dose of 1 platelet unit per 10 kg is recommended, although resources may dictate a smaller dose. This will raise the recipient platelet count by a maximum of about 40,000/microL. Assuming a trigger of 10,000/microL, a transfusion will probably be required approximately every 3 days. It must be remembered that the frequency of platelet transfusions may be greater in the presence of factors accelerating platelet loss or destruction. If fresh whole blood is used, a rule of thumb is to transfuse 10 mL/kg, which will raise the recipient platelet count by a maximum of approximately 10,000/microL. Daily transfusions or transfusions every other day will probably be required.",,"['Abrams-Ogg, Anthony C']",['Abrams-Ogg AC'],"['Department of Clinical Studies, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada. aogg@ovc.uoguelph.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,The Veterinary clinics of North America.

The protocol system will be pro-active: the physician will be automatically prompted from the EPR of a particular patient if the protocol that applies for that patient defines it necessary. The PropeR project studies the impact of a PDSS that is linked to an EPR on daily care processes. There are two areas of research: hospital and home care. This paper describes the application in the hospital. The protocol that is being computerized is a treatment protocol for Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia (AML) that also studies treatment alternatives (conventional versus experimental treatment). This paper based AML protocol has been translated into a formal representation. The KA-tool Gaston is used to make this representation. Twenty-eight subprotocols have been organized in a hierarchical structure with three levels. One of the aims of the project is to make a representation of the AML protocol that can be used in other organizations as well. The main problem we encountered is that the representation not only contains the content of the protocol, but also aspects of application of that protocol in daily care of the hospital and aspects of support. The solution to this problem is the creation of two layers of representation: the first layer is an exact copy of the protocol and thus sharable and the second layer focuses on the support of the protocol in the daily working processes and is mainly domain specific: for the University Hospital Maastricht.

Although very small, it is nonetheless important for clinicians and women to be aware of and to recognize the risk. Postmastectomy irradiation is associated with a slight increase in the risk of developing a sarcoma or lung cancer after a latency period of more than 10 years. However, the majority of information on radiation-associated cancers is derived from large tumor registries, which reflect outdated radiation treatment practices. Modern treatment approaches, which use lower fraction size (or dose) and limit the exposure of surrounding normal tissue to radiation, are less likely to cause radiation-associated cancers. Adjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with any detectable increased risk of solid tumors beyond that which occurs as the population ages. However, alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, and the topoisomerase II inhibitors, doxorubicin and epirubicin, are associated with two types of cytogenetically distinct leukemias after adjuvant chemotherapy. The absolute risk of developing leukemia is lower by orders of magnitude than the improvement in breast cancer mortality that results from adjuvant chemotherapy. Tamoxifen is associated with a two- to threefold increase in the risk of developing endometrial cancer, or about 80 excess cases per 10,000 treated women at 10 years. The benefits of adjuvant therapy outweigh the risks of developing second cancers.

Phenothiazines and leukemia.,267-75,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of phenothiazines (at clinically relevant doses) on the viability and proliferation of leukemic cell lines and normal lymphocytes, and to investigate the possibility of specific induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells. METHODS: Phenothiazines with different chemical structure and hydrophobicity were used: chlorpromazine (CPZ); levomepromazine (LVPZ); prometazine (PMZ); trifluoperazine (TFPZ); thioridazine (TRDZ). The leukemic cell lines used were: Daudi and Raji (derived from Burkitt's lymphoma), K-562 (derived from myelogenous leukemia), and BALL-1, MOLT-4, HPB-ALL and CCRF-HSB-2 (derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The cytotoxicity of the phenothiazines was determined by a CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, using ATP bioluminescence as a marker of cell viability as well as a marker of mitochondrial activity. The proliferation of leukemic cells was determined using a CellTiter-AQ cell proliferation assay which is based on the reduction of a methyl-tetrazolium compound to the formazan product. Apoptosis induction was estimated using phosphatidylserine (PSer) translocation to the cell surface and DNA fragmentation as characteristics of the process. RESULTS: Phenothiazines (at concentrations in the range 0.1-10 micro M) did not affect the viability of normal lymphocytes during a 24-h incubation. Moreover, about 15-20% increase in ATP bioluminescence was observed in normal cells during treatment with 40 micro M phenothiazines. In contrast, the phenothiazines manifested strong cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity against leukemic cells. The most powerful drugs were TFPZ and TRDZ, followed by CPZ. They showed a significant cytotoxic effect against leukemic cells even at 5-10 micro M. The most sensitive cell lines were MOLT-4 and Raji, and the most resistant were HPB-ALL and CCRF-HSB-2. All phenothiazines induced PSer exposure on the surface of leukemic cells, but not of normal lymphocytes. TFPZ, TRDZ and CPZ also induced DNA fragmentation in almost all leukemic cell lines during a 48-h incubation. The strongest apoptotic agent was TRDZ. The apoptosis induction was not accompanied by a significant release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of native cells. Moreover, the drugs markedly suppressed Ca(2+)-induced cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria of leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in clinically relevant doses (up to 20 micro M) some phenothiazines (TFPZ, TRDZ, CPZ) expressed a selective cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity, and induced apoptosis in leukemic cells without any influence on the viability of normal lymphocytes. It is considered that the mechanism of apoptosis induction in phenothiazine-treated leukemic cells is associated with inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase and decreased ATP production, which are crucial events for the viability of cancer cells.",,"['Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Ohba, Hideki', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Hadjimitova, Vera', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Shinohara, Yasuo', 'Baba, Yoshinobu']","['Zhelev Z', 'Ohba H', 'Bakalova R', 'Hadjimitova V', 'Ishikawa M', 'Shinohara Y', 'Baba Y']","['National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST-Shikoku, 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, 761-0395 Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenothiazines)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Phenothiazines/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",2003/12/10 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/12/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0738-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Mar;53(3):267-75. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0738-1.

PML epitomizes a multiprotein nuclear structure, the PML-nuclear body (PML-NB), whose proper formation and function depends on PML. Studies in knockout (KO) mice and cells unraveled an essential pleiotropic role for PML in multiple p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. As a result, Pml(-/-) mice and cells are protected from apoptosis triggered by a number of stimuli such as ionizing radiation, interferon, ceramide, Fas and TNF. It is becoming apparent that PML and the PML-NB act as molecular hubs for the induction and/or reinforcement of programmed cell death through a selective and dynamic regulation of proapoptotic transcriptional events. In addition, recent observations propose a role for PML in checkpoint responses upon DNA damage. Moreover, PML and the PML-NB have also been implicated in the control of genomic stability and DNA repair.

We have previously shown that unprocessed leukapheresis material is useful to restore hematopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy. METHODS: Over a 10-year period in a private practice setting, we prospectively performed autotransplants using noncryopreserved and unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells mobilized from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood by means of filgrastim and using a single-day conditioning regimen with high dose (200 mg/m2) melphalan. RESULTS: Forty-six individuals were given 50 autografts. The median age of the patients was 33 years (range 8-69). Twenty-two patients with acute leukemia (13 with myeloblastic and 9 with lymphoblastic leukemia), 4 with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 6 with multiple myeloma, 7 with Hodgkin's disease, 3 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 4 with metastatic breast carcinoma were included. The median time to achieve >0.5 x 10(9)/l granulocytes was 14 days (range 0-86), whereas the median time to achieve >20 x 10(9)/l platelets was 25 days (range 0-102). The 3,300-day posttransplant survival was 63%, the median posttransplant overall survival was over 3,300 days, the 3,300-day disease-free survival was 50% and the transplant-related mortality was 2%. The procedure was performed entirely on an outpatient basis in the case of 48 autografts (96%). The approximate cost of each graft was 7,500 USD. CONCLUSION: This simplified method to autograft patients, avoiding in-hospital stays, purging procedures and cryopreservation of the cells, is feasible and results in a substantial decrease in the cost of the autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation methods.","['Copyright 2003 S.

The activation of FPRL1 induces a complicated pattern of cellular signaling, which results in the regulation of several immune responses, such as chemotactic migration and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because some of these cellular responses are not beneficial to the host, ligands that selectively modulate these cellular responses are useful. His-Phe-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Met (HFYLPM) is a synthetic peptide that binds to FPRL1. In this study, we generated various HFYLPM analogues and examined their effects on cellular responses via FPRL1 in FPRL1-expressing rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells or in primary human neutrophils. Among the HXYLPM analogues, His-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Met (HRYLPM) activated a broad spectrum of cellular signaling events, including an intracellular Ca(2+) concentration increase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt activation, however, His-Glu-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Met (HEYLPM) activated only intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and Akt but did not increase Ca(2+). In addition, HRYLPM was found to stimulate chemotaxis and ROS generation via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and an intracellular Ca(2+) concentration increase, respectively, whereas HEYLPM stimulated chemotaxis but not ROS generation. With respect to the molecular mechanisms involved in the differential action of HRYLPM and HEYLPM, we found that HRYLPM but not HEYLPM competitively inhibited the binding of (125)I-labeled Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met-NH(2) (WKYMVm, a FPRL1 ligand) to FPRL1. This study demonstrates that the important chemoattractant receptor, FPRL1, may be differentially modulated by distinct peptide ligands.

The receptor is most similar in sequence to the human CMRF-35 receptor, and thus we have named it CMRF-35-like molecule (CLM)-1. By screening the mouse genome, we determined that CLM-1 was part of a multigene family located on a small segment of mouse chromosome 11. Each contains a single Ig domain, and they are expressed mainly in cells of the myeloid lineage. CLM-1 contains multiple cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, including two that lie in consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, and we demonstrate that CLM-1 can associate with Src-homology 2 containing phosphatase-1. Expression of CLM-1 mRNA is down-regulated by treatment with receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), a cytokine that drives osteoclast formation. Furthermore, expression of CLM-1 in the osteoclastogenic cell line RAW (RAW.CLM-1) prevents osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and TGF-beta. RAW.CLM-1 cells fail to multinucleate and do not up-regulate calcitonin receptor, but they express tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K, and beta(3) integrin, suggesting that osteoclastogenesis is blocked at a late-intermediate stage. Thus, we define a new family of myeloid receptors, and demonstrate that the first member of this family, CLM-1, is an inhibitory receptor, able to block osteoclastogenesis.",,"['Chung, Dong-Hui', 'Humphrey, Mary Beth', 'Nakamura, Mary C', 'Ginzinger, David G', 'Seaman, William E', 'Daws, Michael R']","['Chung DH', 'Humphrey MB', 'Nakamura MC', 'Ginzinger DG', 'Seaman WE', 'Daws MR']","['Veterans Administration Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD300C protein, human)', '0 (CLM-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulins/chemistry', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia P388', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family/immunology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/*immunology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2003/12/10 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/12/10 05:00'],"['2003/12/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.171.12.6541 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Dec 15;171(12):6541-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.12.6541.,,,['R01 CA87922-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY457047', 'GENBANK/AY457048', 'GENBANK/AY457049', 'GENBANK/AY457050', 'GENBANK/AY457051', 'GENBANK/AY457052', 'GENBANK/AY457053', 'GENBANK/AY457054', 'GENBANK/AY457055']",,

As these Ags are preferentially expressed by neoplastic tissues, they might represent an ideal target for active immunization by genetic vaccination. However, i.m. inoculation of plasmid DNA encoding mouse gp70 or p15E, two products of the env gene of an endogenous murine leukemia virus, elicited a weak Ag-specific T lymphocyte response and resulted in partial protection from challenge with mouse tumors possessing these Ags. Depletion experiments showed that CD8(+), but not CD4(+), T lymphocytes were crucial for the antitumor activity of the vaccines. Systemic administration of agonistic anti-CD40 mAb increased the therapeutic potential of genetic vaccination, but only when given during the tumor rejection phase and not at the time of immunization. This effect correlated with a dramatic increase in the number of ERV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Adjuvant activity of CD40 agonists thus seems to be relevant to enhance the CD8(+) T cell-dependent response in tumor-bearing hosts, suggesting that sustaining tumor-specific T lymphocyte survival in subjects undergoing vaccination might be a key event in the successful vaccination with weak tumor Ags.",,"['Bronte, Vincenzo', 'Cingarlini, Sara', 'Apolloni, Elisa', 'Serafini, Paolo', 'Marigo, Ilaria', 'De Santo, Carmela', 'Macino, Beatrice', 'Marin, Oriano', 'Zanovello, Paola']","['Bronte V', 'Cingarlini S', 'Apolloni E', 'Serafini P', 'Marigo I', 'De Santo C', 'Macino B', 'Marin O', 'Zanovello P']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. enzo.bronte@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics/*immunology', 'Graft Rejection/*genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/genetics/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology']",2003/12/10 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/12/10 05:00'],"['2003/12/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.171.12.6396 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Dec 15;171(12):6396-405. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.12.6396.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here on the isolation of hemopoietic lineage switch 5 (Hls5), a gene expressed by the monocytoid variant cells, but not the parental J2E cells. Hls5 is a novel member of the RBCC (Ring finger, B box, coiled-coil) family of genes, which includes Pml, Herf1, Tif-1alpha, and Rfp. Hls5 was expressed in a wide range of adult tissues; however, at different stages during embryogenesis, Hls5 was detected in the branchial arches, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, limb buds, and brain. The protein was present in cytoplasmic granules and punctate nuclear bodies. Isolation of the human cDNA and genomic DNA revealed that the gene was located on chromosome 8p21, a region implicated in numerous leukemias and solid tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ACE expression was quantified by flow cytometry using a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against five different epitopes on the ACE molecule and by enzyme activity measurement. RESULTS: The binding pattern of a set of anti-ACE mAbs to the surface of blood cells and their progeny, as revealed by FACS, showed lineage and epitope specificity. Differentiation of monocytes to macrophages and DC was accompanied by a dramatic increase in ACE expression. ACE activity was 50-fold higher in macrophages and 150-fold higher in DC than in monocytes. ACE level normalized per cell revealed that DC expressed 1300-fold more ACE than did monocytes. In contrast, DC derived from acute myeloid leukemia blasts did not show an elevated level of ACE, although they acquired DC markers CD80, CD40, and CD86 upon cytokine or calcium ionophore treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ACE expression becomes the first marker to functionally distinguish DC generated from monocytes and leukemic blast cells. Given that ACE plays an important role in the hydrolysis of many peptides, as well as in the presentation of some antigens to immune cells, these data suggest that elevated ACE expression on the surface of DC is not just a reflection of the general activation of monocytes during differentiation; rather, it may be physiologically important for the functioning of these cells.",,"['Danilov, Sergei M', 'Sadovnikova, Elena', 'Scharenborg, Nicole', 'Balyasnikova, Irina V', 'Svinareva, Daria A', 'Semikina, Elena L', 'Parovichnikova, Elena N', 'Savchenko, Valery G', 'Adema, Gosse J']","['Danilov SM', 'Sadovnikova E', 'Scharenborg N', 'Balyasnikova IV', 'Svinareva DA', 'Semikina EL', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG', 'Adema GJ']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Anesthesiology Research Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1819 W.

CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) are able to activate cytokine production and proliferation of B-CLL cells. Therefore CpG-ODNs were tested for their potential to enhance transgene expression in CLL cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an optimized adenovirus-free packaging system, rAAV vectors coding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV/EGFP) were packaged and highly purified resulting in infectious titers up to 5 x 10(9)/mL. Cells obtained from patients with B-CLL were infected with AAV/EGFP at a multiplicity of infection of 100 while being stimulated with CpG-ODNs and/or CD40L-expressing HeLa/SF cells. Transgene expression was assessed after 48 hours by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Stimulation of B-CLL cells by CpG-ODNs resulted in up-regulation of costimulatory molecules and G(1)/S-phase transition at similar levels compared to activation by HeLa/SF cells, but use of CpG-ODNs alone did not result in any efficient AAV/EGFP transduction. Combined stimulation of B-CLL cells with HeLa/SF cells and CpG-ODNs during AAV/EGFP transduction significantly enhanced transgene expression compared to feeder stimulation alone (p=0.004). In addition, the copy number per single cell was significantly increased by addition of CpG-ODNs as detected by quantitative real-time PCR (p=0.04). Use of self-complementary AAV vectors that are not dependent on target cell DNA synthesis did not result in increased transgene expression compared to single-stranded AAV vectors (p=0.30). CONCLUSION: Stimulation by CD40L is crucial for efficient gene transfer into B-CLL cells by rAAV vectors, whereas transduction efficiency can be significantly enhanced by CpG-ODNs.",,"['Theiss, Hans D', 'Kofler, David M', 'Buning, Hildegard', 'Aldenhoff, Anna-Lena', 'Kaess, Bernhard', 'Decker, Thomas', 'Baumert, Jens', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Theiss HD', 'Kofler DM', 'Buning H', 'Aldenhoff AL', 'Kaess B', 'Decker T', 'Baumert J', 'Hallek M', 'Wendtner CM']","['KKG Gene Therapy, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods/standards', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2003/12/10 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/12/10 05:00'],"['2003/12/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03003059 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2003.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Dec;31(12):1223-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2003.09.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fluorescence-based immunodetection of the promyelocyte protein and the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein was performed on paraffin-embedded and histopathologically graded human uterine cervical tissues. Quantitative measurements of the size and number of the promyelocyte protein-containing nuclear bodies were made and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: We found that promyelocyte protein-containing nuclear bodies exhibit changes in both size and number throughout the continuum of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. An increase in number and size of the bodies occurs with progression from normal to CIN I/CIN II. In CIN III, two new subcategories of nuclear body are present with distinctly different promyelocyte protein patterns, with the type B CIN III losing the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein partnership. In squamous cell carcinoma, we see the loss of this colocalization in both well and poorly differentiated tumors, with a distinctly different promyelocyte protein pattern.

We tested three new regimens for E-SCLC that might merit further investigation in a subsequent phase III trial. Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9430 was a randomized phase II study evaluating 4 treatment arms in 57 evaluable, previously untreated E-SCLC patients. Each arm consisted of the following: Arm 1: cisplatin plus topotecan; Arm 2: cisplatin plus paclitaxel; Arm 3: paclitaxel 230 mg/m2 plus topotecan; and Arm 4: paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus topotecan. Because of an accrual time difference, Arm 2 will not be discussed in this manuscript. Arm 1 (12 patients) produced 1 complete response (CR, 8%) and an overall response rate (ORR) of 42%. Toxicity was excessive, with 3 deaths (25%). Arm 3 (13 patients) produced no CRs, 7 partial responses (PRs, 54%), median survival of 13.8 months, and failure-free survival (FFS) of 7.41 months, with 3 toxic deaths (25%). Among 32 evaluable patients on Arm 4, there were 2 CRs (6%) and 20 PRs (63%) for an ORR of 69%, median survival of 9.9 months, FFS of 5.21 months, and 1-year survival of 40%. There was 1 possible treatment-related death (3%). Topotecan plus cisplatin, in the doses and schedule employed, produced excessive toxicity and modest efficacy in E-SCLC patients. Paclitaxel (230 mg/m2 on day 1) plus topotecan (1 mg/m2 on days 1-5) produced excessive toxicity that was ameliorated with an attenuated paclitaxel dose (175 mg/m2). With the latter regimen (Arm 4) in patients with a performance status of 0/1, CR rates, FFS, overall survival, and 1-year survival were similar to standard etoposide plus cisplatin chemotherapy.

Differences in viability and ultrastructure between sensitive and multidrug-resistant L1210 mouse leukemic cells under hypoxia.,265-73,"The comparative study of sensitive and multidrug-resistant L1210 cells under 24 hours of hypoxia (2% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C) was done to see if differences in energetic metabolism between both cell lines are paralleled by differences in cellular morphology. During the dye exclusion assay the viability of sensitive cells was about 70 to 90%, whereas only 30 to 50% of resistant cells were viable. Electron microscopic study of sensitive and resistant L1210 cells under hypoxia has shown cells of different ultrastructural appearance in both cell lines. Cells with necrotic changes (swollen mitochondria, lysed cells) prevailed in resistant cells. The highest incidence of cells with normal or slightly dense mitochondria was found among the sensitive L1210 cells. Additionally, cells with pyknotic nuclei, shrunken cytoplasm and dense mitochondria, reminiscent of apoptosis, could be found sporadically, especially in the sensitive L1210 cell line. These results are in agreement with flow cytometry measurements: in resistant cells the number of necrotic cells was on the average 2.3 times higher than in sensitive cells. Ultrastructural differences and differences in the numbers of necrotic cells as measured by flow cytometry between sensitive and resistant L1210 cells under hypoxia are consistent with differences in energetic metabolism between these cell lines, as described in earlier studies, and document an increased cell death in the resistant L1210 cell line.",,"['El-Saggan, A H', 'Dovinova, I', 'Sulova, Z', 'Barancik, M', ""Hunakova, L'"", 'Breier, A', 'Uhrik, B']","['El-Saggan AH', 'Dovinova I', 'Sulova Z', 'Barancik M', 'Hunakova L', 'Breier A', 'Uhrik B']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Hypoxia/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2003/12/10 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/12/10 05:00'],"['2003/12/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2003 Jun;22(2):265-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have searched direct evidence of the action of IgD on KU812 cells, generally classified as an immature basophilic cell line. We analyzed by flow cytometry the capacity of IgD, purified from IgD myeloma sera, to bind KU812 cells. Biotinylated monomeric IgD (mIgD) and biotinylated oligomeric IgD (oIgD) could bind KU812 cells. Blocking experiments with others immunoglobulin isotypes showed that KU812 cells expressed an unspecific receptor for IgD. However, oIgD but not mIgD enhances the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from KU812 cells. On the other hand, mIgD and oIgD failed to induce histamine release from KU812 cells or from cord blood derived basophils.

In present study it is shown that human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells can undergo two different types of apoptosis, premitotic and postmitotic. METHODS: HL-60 cells were irradiated with doses 8 and 20 Gy. For apoptosis detection APO2.7 antigen (mitochondrial membrane specific protein) expression without and with permeabilization by digitonin was used. This method was compared with flow-cytometric analysis of cell light scattering properties and determination of subG1 DNA. RESULT: Cells irradiated with high dose (20 Gy) died rapidly by premitotic apoptosis (interphase death) from all phases of cell cycle. 2 hours after irradiation cells with subdiploid DNA content and cells stained by APO2.7 after digitonin permeabilization appeared. After 6 hours 40% of cells were apoptotic, nonapoptotic cells were mainly in G1-phase. Lower dose (8 Gy) after 6 hours of irradiation caused accumulation of cells in S-phase. After 24 hours majority of cells was in G2-phase and apoptotic cells appeared (subG1 peak, APO2.7 with permeabilization).

Expression of AML fusion proteins in transgenic mice increases the risk of myeloid leukemias, suggesting that they induce a preleukemic state.

We expressed AML1/ETO, PML/RAR, and PLZF/RAR in U937 hemopoietic precursor cells and measured global gene expression using oligonucleotide chips. We identified 1,555 genes regulated concordantly by at least two fusion proteins that were further validated in patient samples and finally classified according to available functional information. Strikingly, we found that AML fusion proteins induce genes involved in the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype and repress DNA repair genes, mainly of the base excision repair pathway. Functional studies confirmed that ectopic expression of fusion proteins constitutively activates pathways leading to increased stem cell renewal (e.g., the Jagged1/Notch pathway) and provokes accumulation of DNA damage.

We and others recently demonstrated that high numbers of Treg's can also modulate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) if administered in conjunction with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in mice. In a clinical setting, it would be impossible to obtain enough freshly purified Treg's from a single donor to have a therapeutic effect. Thus, we performed regulatory T cell expansion ex vivo by stimulation with allogeneic APCs, which has the additional effect of producing alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells. Here we show that regulatory T cells specific for recipient-type alloantigens control GVHD while favoring immune reconstitution. Irrelevant regulatory T cells only mediate a partial protection from GVHD.

These chimeric proteins have constitutive FGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity and are believed to deregulate hemopoietic development in a manner analogous to BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia. Here we have studied the role of STAT proteins in transformation mediated by the most common of these fusions, ZNF198-FGFR1. We found that STATs 1, 3, and 5 were activated constitutively in ZNF198-FGFR1-transformed Ba/F3 cells and that STATs 2, 4, and 6 were also tyrosine-phosphorylated. Induction of dominant negative STAT mutants showed that activation of STAT5, but not STATs 1 or 3, was essential for the anti-apoptotic effect of ZNF198-FGFR1 and that STAT5 activation is essential for the elevated levels of BclXL in transformed cells. STAT5 activation was also shown to be required for continued cell cycle progression of BaF3/ZNF198-FGFR1 cells in conditions of cytokine deprivation and for up-regulation of the DNA repair protein Rad51.

Unexpectedly, they also display stable cross-resistance to tunicamycin, thapsigargin, dithiothreitol, and cycloheximide but not doxorubicin, etoposide, or Fas ligand. Phenotypic analysis indicates that the cells display increased store-operated calcium influx and resistance to ER Ca2+ store depletion by Ec. E2R2, the most resistant clone, was observed to maintain protein synthesis levels after treatment with Ec or thapsigargin. Expression of GRP78, an ER-based chaperone, was induced by these ER stress treatments but to equal degrees in HL-60 and E2R2 cells. By using microarray analysis, at least 15 ribosomal protein genes were found to be overexpressed in E2R2 compared with HL-60 cells. We also found that ribosomal protein content was increased by 30% in E2R2 as well as other clones. The resistance phenotype was partially reversed by the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin.

The repressor activity of Bach1 is inhibited by the direct binding of heme. To investigate the involvement of Bach1 in the heme-dependent regulation of the expression of the beta-globin gene, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were cultured with succinylacetone (SA), a specific inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, and the level of beta-globin mRNA was examined. A marked decrease of beta-globin mRNA in SA-treated cells was observed, and this decrease was reversed by the addition of hemin. An iron chelator, desferrioxamine, also lowered the level of beta-globin mRNA. The heme-dependent expression of beta-globin is a transcriptional event since the expression of the human beta-globin gene promoter-reporter gene containing the microlocus control region (microLCR) was inhibited when human erythroleukemia K562 cells and MEL cells were cultured with SA. Hemin treatment restored the decrease in promoter activity caused by SA. The control of the microLCR-beta-globin promoter reporter gene by heme was dependent on DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), which contains MARE. The MARE binding activity of Bach1 in K562 and MEL cells increased upon SA treatment, and the increase was diminished by the treatment with hemin. Transient expression of Bach1 suppressed the microLCR activity, and this repressor activity was cancelled by treatment with hemin. The expression of a mutated Bach1 lacking heme-binding sites led to a loss in the heme responsiveness of the microLCR. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Bach1 bound to the MARE of HS2 increased by the treatment of MEL cells with SA, and this was cancelled by hemin. We propose that heme positively regulates the beta-globin gene expression by blocking the interaction of Bach1 with the MARE in the LCR.",,"['Tahara, Tsuyoshi', 'Sun, Jiying', 'Nakanishi, Katsuyuki', 'Yamamoto, Masafumi', 'Mori, Hajime', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Fujita, Hiroyoshi', 'Igarashi, Kazuhiko', 'Taketani, Shigeru']","['Tahara T', 'Sun J', 'Nakanishi K', 'Yamamoto M', 'Mori H', 'Saito T', 'Fujita H', 'Igarashi K', 'Taketani S']","['Department of Biotechnology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto 606-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BACH1 protein, human)', '0 (Bach1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Heme/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Heptanoates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2003/12/09 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2003/12/09 05:00'],"['2003/12/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M302733200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)74879-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Feb 13;279(7):5480-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M302733200.

The important role of T cells and T-cell cytokines in the long-term control of CML is well established, for example in allogeneic stem-cell graft recipients. This study examined whether or not molecularly targeted therapy with imatinib, an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, improved endogenous T-cell function in patients resistant to or intolerant of previous IFN-alpha therapy. Intracellular cytokine staining and detection by flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of the T1 cytokine IFN-gamma in T cells. To secure independence from changes in white blood cell counts during treatment, a constant number of T cells was purified from the peripheral blood before analysis of the proportion of IFN-gamma synthesizing T cells. Twenty-nine patients with CML were tested before and after a median follow-up of 3 month on imatinib. In addition, late follow-up (past the median time to best cytogenetic response) of 15 patients were obtained Twenty-nine age- and gender-matched individuals were used as healthy controls. The frequency of IFN-gamma producing T cells in CML patients resistant to or intolerant to previous IFN-alpha therapy was lower than in healthy individuals (p=0.0181, Mann-Whitney test). Imatinib therapy led to a significant increase over pre-treatment values (p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Late follow-up indicated that the increase was sustained in patients not in major cytogenetic response.

In this report, we investigated the effect of artemisinin on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell culture system. Artemisinin markedly increased the degree of HL-60 leukemia cell differentiation when simultaneously combined with low doses of 1 alpha,25-dihydoxyvitamin D(3) [1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)] or all-trans retinoic acid (all-trans RA). Artemisinin by itself had very weak effects on the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cytofluorometric analysis and cell morphologic studies indicated that artemisinin potentiated 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced cell differentiation predominantly into monocytes and all-trans RA-induced cell differentiation into granulocytes, respectively. Extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors markedly inhibited HL-60 cell differentiation induced by artemisinin in combination with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or all-trans RA, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors did not. Particularly, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors inhibited HL-60 cell differentiation induced by artemisinin in combination with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) but not with all-trans RA. Artemisinin enhanced PKC activity and protein level of PKC beta I isoform in only 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-treated HL-60 cells.

Although many oncogenes are expressed in alternative forms in cancer, thus far, only one form of the human HOX11 transcript has been reported. We describe here the identification of three alternative transcripts of the HOX11 proto-oncogene, expressed in primary T-ALL specimens. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and targeted RT-PCR, we have sequenced 23 individual cDNA clones characterising these novel transcripts. Northern hybridisation identified particular novel exons expressed in T-ALL, which are not expressed in normal T-cells. To date, aberrant expression of HOX11 has only been associated with leukaemia. Our survey of a range of neuroblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) cell lines demonstrated the expression of these novel HOX11 transcripts in tumours of neural origin, while their expression was not detected in normal brain tissues. Strikingly, the dominant transcript in these neural tumour cell lines is more than 1 kb larger than the dominant transcript in T-ALL.

The (O,O')/(O,N)-isomeric mixture with the mole ratio of 80/20 exhibited excellent antitumor activity while the pure (O,N)-isomer was only marginally active.

It exhibits in vitro antiplasmodial activities but the molecular basis of this biological activity is not known. The strong structural similarity with the alkaloid berberine prompted us to postulate that burasaine could interact with DNA. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the mode of binding of burasaine to DNA and tested its cytotoxic potential toward human HL-60 leukemia cells. Its inhibitory activity toward topoisomerases I and II was also studied. Absorption and melting temperature measurements attested that burasaine forms stable complexes with DNA. The results of electric linear dichroism (ELD) spectroscopy may be interpreted either by an intercalation or by an external stacking parallel to the base pairs. The affinity of burasaine for DNA is slightly lower than that of berberine and this translates at the cellular level by a reduced cytotoxicity. Burasaine does not promote DNA cleavage by human topoisomerases I or II and this likely accounts for its very weak cytotoxic potential and its very modest effects on the cell cycle progression observed at high concentrations.

Recent evidence suggests that Gag may co-opt the host cell's endocytic machinery to facilitate retroviral assembly and release. RESULTS: A search for novel partners interacting with the Gag protein of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) via the yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay resulted in the identification of endophilin 2, a component of the machinery involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that endophilin interacts with the matrix or MA domain of the Gag protein of Mo-MuLV, but not of human immunodeficiency virus, HIV. Both exogenously expressed and endogenous endophilin are incorporated into Mo-MuLV viral particles. Titration experiments suggest that the binding sites for inclusion of endophilin into viral particles are limited and saturable. Knock-down of endophilin with small interfering RNA (siRNA) had no effect on virion production, but overexpression of endophilin and, to a lesser extent, of several fragments of the protein, result in inhibition of Mo-MuLV virion production, but not of HIV virion production. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that endophilins interact with Mo-MuLV Gag and affect virion production. The findings imply that endophilin is another component of the large complex that is hijacked by retroviruses to promote virion production.",,"['Wang, Margaret Q', 'Kim, Wankee', 'Gao, Guangxia', 'Torrey, Ted A', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'De Camilli, Pietro', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Wang MQ', 'Kim W', 'Gao G', 'Torrey TA', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'De Camilli P', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Microbiology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Biol,Journal of biology,101147570,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (SH3GLB1 protein, human)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Transport Vesicles/chemistry/genetics', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2003/12/09 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2003/12/09 05:00'],"['2003/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2003/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/12/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2003/12/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1475-4924-3-4 [doi]', '1475-4924-3-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol. 2003;3(1):4. doi: 10.1186/1475-4924-3-4.

Median follow-up was 58 months in BMT recipients and 18 months in PBSCT recipients. Neutrophil (median, Day 8 vs Day 13, p < 0.001) and platelet engraftment (median, Day 9 vs Day 17, p < 0.001) was faster in the PBSCT group than in the BMT group. Patients receiving PBSCT required less platelet transfusion than those receiving BMT (median, 54 units vs 144 units, p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in red cell transfusion. At 100 days, there was no difference in the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (42.9% vs 33.3%, p = 0.72) or grade II-IV acute GVHD (14.3% vs 5.6%, p = 0.57), and there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (20% vs 33.3%, p = 0.67). No chronic GVHD was noted in any relapsed patients (BMT, 5; PBSCT, 3), and no patients with chronic GVHD during follow-up had a relapse. Relapse was the most frequent cause of death inboth groups (BMT, 5/9, 55.6%; PBSCT, 3/4, 75%; p = 0.25); all relapses occurred within 1 year after transplantation.

Currently, several multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays for detecting bcr-abl are available to assess the levels of the three common fusion transcripts, b2a2, b3a2 and e1a2. Although these assays circumvent the requirement for individual fusion sequence quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based assays, they do not identify the specific fusion transcript. Knowledge of the latter is useful to rule out false-positive results and to compare clones before and after therapy. We designed a novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay to detect bcr-abl that allows accurate quantification and determination of the specific fusion transcript. In this assay, abl primer labeled at its 5' end with the fluorescent dye NED (Applied Biosystems) is incorporated into the bcr-abl fusion product during amplification.

Persistent infection did not cause Schwann cell apoptosis or cytopathic effect. Defects in myelination coincided with the down-regulation of dystroglycan expression and disruption of the laminin-2 organization and basal lamina assembly on Schwann cell-axon units. The data provide evidence for a selective perturbation of laminin-2-laminin-2 receptor communication pathway in the peripheral nervous system by a nonlytic virus and the resulting myelin defects, which may partly contribute to neurological abnormalities associated with arenaviral infection.",,"['Rambukkana, Anura', 'Kunz, Stefan', 'Min, Jenny', 'Campbell, Kevin P', 'Oldstone, Michael B A']","['Rambukkana A', 'Kunz S', 'Min J', 'Campbell KP', 'Oldstone MB']","['Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY10021, USA. rambuka@mail.rockefeller.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '146888-27-9 (Dystroglycans)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arenaviridae Infections/*physiopathology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Dystroglycans', 'Ganglia, Spinal/physiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Laminin/metabolism', '*Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Myelin Sheath/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/*physiology/*virology']",2003/12/06 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/12/06 05:00'],"['2003/12/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.2232366100 [doi]', '2232366100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Dec 23;100(26):16071-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2232366100.

Here, we identified a homologue of Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in Caenorhabditis elegans (CeRhoGEF), which functions downstream of gpa-12, the C. elegans homologue of G alpha 12/13. CeRhoGEF contains a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 domain and a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain upstream of the Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology region similar to mammalian RhoGEFs with RGS domains, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1-RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF. It has been shown in mammalian cells that these RhoGEFs interact with activated forms of G alpha 12 or G alpha 13 through their RGS domains. We demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation that the RGS domain of CeRhoGEF interacts with GPA-12 in an AIF4- activation-dependent manner and confirmed that the Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology domain of CeRhoGEF was capable of Rho-dependent signaling. These results proved conservation of the G alpha 12-RhoGEF pathway in C. elegans. Expression of DsRed or GFP under the control of the promoter of CeRhoGEF or gpa-12 revealed an overlap of their expression patterns in ventral cord motor neurons and several neurons in the head. RNA-mediated gene interference for CeRhoGEF and gpa-12 resulted in similar phenotypes such as embryonic lethality and sensory and locomotive defects in adults. Thus, the G alpha 12/13-RhoGEF pathway is likely to be involved in embryonic development and neuronal function in C. elegans.",,"['Yau, Douglas M', 'Yokoyama, Nobuhiko', 'Goshima, Yoshio', 'Siddiqui, Zeba K', 'Siddiqui, Shahid S', 'Kozasa, Tohru']","['Yau DM', 'Yokoyama N', 'Goshima Y', 'Siddiqui ZK', 'Siddiqui SS', 'Kozasa T']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (fluorescent protein 583)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",IM,"['Allergy and Immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'COS Cells', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/*chemistry/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RGS Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction']",2003/12/06 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/12/06 05:00'],"['2003/12/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.2533143100 [doi]', '2533143100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Dec 9;100(25):14748-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2533143100.

We hypothesized that rapamycin might demonstrate activity against B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We have found that rapamycin inhibited growth of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia lines in vitro, with evidence of apoptotic cell death. This growth inhibition was reversible by IL-7. One candidate as a signaling intermediate cross-regulated by rapamycin and IL-7 was p70 S6 kinase. Rapamycin also demonstrated in vivo activity in E mu-ret transgenic mice, which develop pre-B leukemia/lymphoma: E mu-ret transgenic mice with advanced disease treated daily with rapamycin as a single agent showed a >2-fold increase in length of survival as compared with symptomatic littermates who received vehicle alone.

It is essential for the signal transduction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and related cytokines. In response to IL-6 stimulation STAT3 becomes phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to enhancer sequences of target genes. We found that activated STAT3 is enriched in dot-like structures within the nucleus, which we termed STAT3 nuclear bodies. To examine the dynamics of STAT3 nuclear body formation, a fusion protein of STAT3 and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was constructed. Studies in living cells have shown that the appearance of STAT3 nuclear bodies is transient, correlating with the timecourse of tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT3. Furthermore, we show by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis that STAT3 within nuclear bodies consists of a highly mobile and an immobile fraction. Colocalization studies provided evidence that these bodies are accompanied with CREB binding protein (CBP) and acetylated histone H4, which are markers for transcriptionally active chromatin. Moreover, STAT3 nuclear bodies in HepG2 cells are not colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia oncoprotein (PML)-containing bodies; neither is a sumoylation of activated STAT3 detectable.

The PPAR-gamma isoform is expressed in human T lymphocytes, and oral administration of PPAR-gamma agonists ameliorates the clinical course and histopathological features in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model for multiple sclerosis, suggesting a potential role for PPAR-gamma agonists in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. To assess a potential therapeutic role of PPAR-gamma agonists in multiple sclerosis, we compared the immunomodulatory effects of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs pioglitazone (PIO) and ciglitazone and the non-TZD PPAR-gamma agonist GW347845 on human T leukemia cells (Jurkat cells) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 21 multiple sclerosis patients and 12 healthy donors. PIO, ciglitazone, and GW347845 suppressed PHA-induced T cell proliferation by 40-50% and secretion of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha, by 30-50%. Inhibition of proliferation was increased to approximately 80% and that of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, to 80-90% when PBMCs were first preincubated with PPAR-gamma agonists and re-exposed at the time of PHA stimulation, indicating a sensitizing effect of PPAR-gamma agonists. Inhibition of proliferation was also observed in the tetanus toxoid-specific T cell line KHS.TT2, albeit to a lesser extent. The antiproliferative effects of PIO and GW347845 were accompanied by a decrease of cell viability.

Yeast two-hybrid studies and affinity column binding assay show that the isolated AT(2) C-terminus binds to the transcription factor promyelocytic zinc finger protein (PLZF). Cellular studies employing confocal microscopy show that Ang II stimulation induces cytosolic PLZF to co-localize with AT(2) at the plasma membrane, then drives AT(2) and PLZF to internalize. PLZF slowly emerges in the nucleus whereas AT(2) accumulates in the perinuclear region. Nuclear PLZF binds to a consensus sequence of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase p85 alpha subunit (p85 alpha PI3K) gene.

In mice, a transient rise in the uterine expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) occurs on d 4 of pregnancy and is essential for embryo implantation.

We performed a subtractive hybridization assay between luminal epithelial (LE) mRNAs from d 3 and 4 of pregnancy to find genes up-regulated on d 4 and which would be potentially regulated by LIF. One candidate, Coch-5b2, was up-regulated on the day of implantation. Coch mRNA localized to the LE of wild-type mice and was not detected in uteri from Lif-deficient mice. Treatment of LE with LIF, both in vitro and in vivo, resulted in the up-regulation of Coch. Coch is also highly expressed in other tissues, including the spleen and inner ear, but only in the uterus is Coch expression regulated by LIF. Mice were derived in which Coch was either deleted or tagged with a LacZ reporter. In mice carrying the tagged Coch gene, expression of Coch was detected in the LE and also at the site of embryo implantation. However, mice in which the Coch gene was deleted were normal, showing no overt defects in their reproduction.

C/EBPalpha mutations are found in approximately 8% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Most of these mutations occur in the N-terminal coding region, resulting in a frame shift and the enhanced translation of a dominant-negative 30-kDa protein, which may be responsible for the differentiation block observed in AML. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a cDNA encoding an N-terminal mutated C/EBPalpha (mut10) into primary hematopoietic progenitors using a retroviral vector. Expression of mut10 in human CD34+ cord blood cells dramatically inhibited differentiation of both myeloid and erythroid lineages. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated coexpression of both myeloid and erythroid markers in the immature transformed cells. Surprisingly, mut10 did not block myelocytic differentiation in murine progenitors but did alter their differentiation kinetics and clonogenicity. Experiments were performed to confirm that the differential effect of mut10 on murine and human progenitors was not due to species-specific differences in C/EBPalpha protein sequences, expression levels, or inefficient targeting of relevant cells.

This study was designed to determine whether DNA hypomethylation-associated aberrant gene expression is involved in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) leukemogenesis. We isolated hypomethylated DNA regions of ATL cells compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a carrier by a methylated CpG-island amplification/representational difference analysis method. The DNA regions identified contained MEL1, CACNA1H, and Nogo receptor genes. Sequencing using sodium bisulfite-treated genomic DNAs revealed the decreased methylated CpG sites, confirming that this method detected hypomethylated DNA regions. Moreover, these hypomethylated genes were aberrantly transcribed. Among them, MEL1S, an alternatively spliced form of MEL1 lacking the PR (positive regulatory domain I binding factor 1 and retinoblastoma-interacting zinc finger protein) domain, was frequently transcribed in ATL cells, and the transcriptional initiation sites were identified upstream from exons 4 and 6. Transfection of MEL1S into CTLL-2 cells conferred resistance against transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), suggesting that aberrant expression of MEL1S was associated with dysregulation of TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Although Tax renders cells resistant to TGF-beta, Tax could not be produced in most fresh ATL cells, in which MEL1S might be responsible for TGF-beta resistance.

Mice lacking expression of the interferon (IFN) consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), an IFN gamma-inducible transcription factor of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, develop a disease similar to human CML. Mounting evidence suggests a role for ICSBP in the pathogenesis of CML. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. By stable and conditional expression of ICSBP in wild-type and BCR/ABL-transformed 32D cells (32D/wt and 32D/BA), we found that ICSBP inhibited BCR/ABL-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. Moreover, ICSBP also overrode BCR/ABL-mediated morphology changes, chemotherapy, and imatinib resistance, as well as BCR/ABL-induced repression of differentiation. Some of these ICSBP effects may be explained in part by an ICSBP-mediated repression of bcl-2, a major antiapoptotic target of BCR/ABL, on transcriptional and protein level. Using reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays we identified that the bcl-2 promoter activity was inhibited by ICSBP by way of a fragment containing 2 characteristic ICSBP-responsive elements. An inverse correlation between ICSBP and bcl-2 expression was confirmed in vivo.

We sought to determine mechanisms through which LTB4 modulates atherosclerosis in cell lines expressing LTB4 receptors, BLT-1, and in mice deficient in BLT-1 as well as macrophage cell lines derived from BLT-1+/+ and BLT-1-/- mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of global changes in gene expression induced by LTB4 in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) expressing the human BLT-1 showed highest-fold increase in expression of fatty acid translocase/CD36 and the chemokine MCP1/JE/CCL2, which are critical in atherogenesis. To determine the importance of BLT-1 in atherogenesis, we crossed BLT-1-null mice with apolipoprotein (apo)-E-deficient mice, which develop severe atherosclerosis. Deletion of BLT-1 significantly reduced the lesion formation in apo-E-/- mice only during initiating stages (4 and 8 weeks) but had no effect on the lesion size in mice fed atherogenic diet for 19 weeks. Macrophage cell lines from BLT-1-deficient mice expressed the low-affinity LTB4 receptor, BLT-2, and exhibited chemotaxis to LTB4. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of LTB4 in atherosclerosis are likely mediated through the high-affinity BLT-1 and the low-affinity BLT-2 receptors. LTB4 promotes atherosclerosis by chemo-attracting monocytes, by providing an amplification loop of monocyte chemotaxis via CCL2 production, and by converting monocytes to foam cells by enhanced expression of CD36 and fatty acid accumulation.",,"['Subbarao, Krishnaprasad', 'Jala, Venkatakrishna R', 'Mathis, Steven', 'Suttles, Jill', 'Zacharias, Wolfgang', 'Ahamed, Jasimuddin', 'Ali, Hydar', 'Tseng, Michael T', 'Haribabu, Bodduluri']","['Subbarao K', 'Jala VR', 'Mathis S', 'Suttles J', 'Zacharias W', 'Ahamed J', 'Ali H', 'Tseng MT', 'Haribabu B']","['James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville Health Sciences, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '6YM3LQP2WR (leukotriene B2 receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/deficiency/physiology', 'Arteriosclerosis/*etiology/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis/physiology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukotriene B4/physiology', 'Macrophages/chemistry/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Leukotriene/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4/biosynthesis/deficiency/*physiology']",2003/12/06 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/12/06 05:00'],"['2003/12/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1161/01.ATV.0000110503.16605.15 [doi]', '01.ATV.0000110503.16605.15 [pii]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2004 Feb;24(2):369-75. doi: 10.1161/01.ATV.0000110503.16605.15.

The biological activity of VEGF is mediated by two different receptor tyrosine kinases: VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1. The soluble form of VEGFR-1 is likely to be a negative regulator of VEGF availability, but the physiological role of sVEGFR-2 is still unclear. The plasma levels of sVEGFR-1 and sVEGFR-2 in patients with acute leukemia have not been investigated. We measured the plasma concentrations of VEGF and its two soluble receptors in 39 AML and 15 ALL patients as well as in the control group, using the ELISA assay. We also correlated the plasma levels of these proteins with disease status and known prognostic factors. The sVEGFR-1 level was significantly higher in patients with AML and ALL than in the healthy subjects (p < 0.002 and p < 0.03 respectively). The sVEGFR-2 level was significantly higher in AML patients compared with the control group (p < 0.03). The VEGF levels in AML and ALL patients and in healthy subjects did not differ significantly. The sVEGFR-1 level was higher in AML patients with > 50% of blasts in the bone marrow (BM), WBC > 20 G/L and elevated LDH level, than in the group with BM blasts < 50% (p < 0.01), WBC < 20 G/L (p < 0.02) and a normal LDH level (p < 0.05). Positive correlations between sVEGFR-1 level and WBC (p < 0.02),% of BM blasts (p < 0.05), the absolute blast count in peripheral blood (ABC) (p < 0.009) and LDH (p < 0.000001) were found. The sVEGFR-1/VEGF ratio (R1) was calculated, and a positive correlation between R1 and ABC in AML (p < 0.03) was determined. A higher (above median) sVEGFR-1/VEGF ratio correlated with a lower CR rate and a shorter survival (p < 0.03 and p = 0.0007 respectively). In conclusion, the plasma concentration of sVEGFR-1 is higher in leukemia patients than in healthy subjects and correlates with tumour burden and poor prognosis. The sVEGFR-1/VEGF ratio may be of greater prognostic value than VEGF alone.

AIMS: The present study surveyed haematologists in Australia and New Zealand. We aimed to record theoretical referral times, identify problems with referral to palliative care and clarify elements used to decide whether a patient was ""terminally ill"". METHODS: A questionnaire based on the case-histories of three patients (with acute leukaemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma) was distributed at the Haematology Society of Australia and New Zealand Congress 2000, Perth, Australia. Each case was divided into stages by transitional points in the illness to include issues or prognostic variables that may stimulate referral to palliative care. Questions were asked about: (i) referral-triggers, (ii) problems previously experienced, (iii) definition of when the patient was ""terminally ill"", (iv) prognostication difficulties and (v) communication about prognosis. RESULTS: The response rate was 11%, which may represent up to 32% of Australian specialists. Eighty per cent had access to all types of palliative care services and refer for symptom control, regardless of illness stage. Twenty-nine per cent had experienced difficulties in referring. There was a variation as to exactly when referral would occur and when each case was considered ""terminally ill"". Reasons for early or later referral were explored. Prognostication difficulties were common. CONCLUSIONS: In theory there is a willingness to refer to palliative care, however this has yet to be translated to day-to-day practice. This may be due to prognostication difficulties, logistical factors and medical concerns. Models of referral are suggested for further study.",,"['Auret, K', 'Bulsara, C', 'Joske, D']","['Auret K', 'Bulsara C', 'Joske D']","['School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. auretk@cyllene.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Australia', 'Communication', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Palliative Care', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2003/12/06 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2003/12/06 05:00'],"['2003/12/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['490 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1445-5994.2003.00490.x [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2003 Dec;33(12):566-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2003.00490.x.,,,,,['Intern Med J. 2003 Dec;33(12):549-51.

While the defect in this interaction results in an insufficient hematopoiesis, the aberrantly elevated activation leads to the transformation of hematopoietic cells. The constitutive active mutations of receptor tyrosine kinase, such as c-Kit platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) or fins-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), play a major role in the development of hematopoietic neoplasia. The constitutive activation is provoked by several mechanisms, such as making fusion genes by chromosomal translocations, or various mutations involving regulatory regions of the receptor. The chromosomal translocation brings the receptor intracytoplasmic domain juxtaposed to an unrelated molecule which has dimerization or multimerization motif, resulting in the constitutive dimerization of the receptor. The missense, insertion or deletion mutations in the regulatory regions, such as juxtamembrane domain, activation loop and extracellular domain, cause constitutive activation by releasing the respective auto-inhibitory functions of each regulatory region. Constitutive active receptors generate different signals quantitatively and qualitatively from wild type receptor, which mediate the oncogenic phenotype.

The primary effect of GP7 is the anticancer activity on transplanted mouse tumors and cultured tumor cells. However, its molecular mechanism of action is still obscure. In this study, we investigated the activity of GP7 to induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 and Jurkat cells. Apoptosis was determined by detection of DNA fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis. GP7 induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation of HL-60 and Jurkat cells in time- and dose-dependent manner. We further investigated the activity of caspase-3 in GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation of HL-60 and Jurkat cells. GP7 also induced time- and dose-dependent caspase-3 activation in both cell lines, and the kinetics of caspase-3 activation induced by GP7 was well correlated with that of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. To determine the role of caspase-3 in GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation, we examined the effect of specific caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, on GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Ac-DEVD-CHO prevented GP7-induced caspase-3 activation in both HL-60 and Jurkat cells, however, it only inhibited GP7-induced apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells. We then employed L-carnitine to investigate the role of caspase-3 in GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. L-carnitine treatment prevented GP7-induced caspase-3 activation in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to Ac-DEVD-CHO, L-carnitine only inhibited GP7-induced apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells.

As a potent immunosuppressive agent, TGF-beta1 induces apoptosis in primary lymphocytes. However, it has been recognized that TGF-beta1 plays certain roles in development or progression of hematopoietic tumours via inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death. Several studies have highlighted the mechanisms of TGF-beta1-induced Fas resistance and its contribution to aggressive tumour behavior. In this study, we have focused on the mechanisms by which TGF-beta1 protected leukaemia/lymphoma cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. The presented study provides that TGF-beta1 inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis of leukaemia/lymphoma cells in two distinct pathways. First, TGF-beta1 reduced expression of surface Fas receptors by blockade of trafficking cytoplasmic Fas to the surface, which allowed the leukaemia cells to resist Fas-mediated cell death. However, total Fas levels including both surface and cytoplasmic Fas were not altered, indicating that forced degradation of Fas or transcriptional regulation was not involved. Second, TGF-beta1 up-regulated Fas signaling pathway inhibitor cFLIPL to block the pro-caspase-8 cleavage and thus promoted survival of leukaemia/lymphoma cells.

Two contigs of BAC probes flanking the MLL gene, were constructed by standard primer walking and BAC end sequencing.

Metaphase chromosomes were prepared from the bone marrow sample of an 80-year old female patient with AML-M1 and the cytogenetic aberration der(11)hsr(11) (q23). FISH analysis on metaphase chromosomes showed amplification on the homogeneously staining region (hsr) and marker chromosomes for both the MLL gene and the BAC probes. Using dual color FISH, probes proximal to MLL showed greater amplification than those distal to MLL, as represented by additional red signals on both metaphase and interphase chromosomes. Ratios of the copy numbers of the BAC probes relative to the chromosome 11 centromere copy number confirmed a higher copy number for probes proximal to MLL.

HL-60R exhibits resistance to apoptosis induced from P-gp substrate drugs and also from other triggers (cisplatin, TNF-alpha, Fas ligation, TRAIL, IFN-gamma and serum starvation) not related to the multidrug transporter. Except for c-IAP-1 mRNA, HL-60R significantly over-expressed both the mRNAs and the proteins of all the IAPs studied, i.e. c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, XIAP, NAIP and survivin. Determination of the DNA-binding capacity of NF-kappaB (p50 or p65 subunits) indicated that, while HL-60 cells show constitutive activation of p50 only, HL-60R cells contain the activated forms of both p50 and p65. Since p65 is necessary to form the NF-kappaB heterodimers able to increase transcription, its presence in HL-60R cells might well correlate to their increased levels of IAPs and, possibly of P-gp, which, reportedly, are NF-kappaB target genes. These results underline the possible role that the coordinated over-expression of the different IAPs may play in tumor cell resistance to drug induced apoptosis.

Using cell lines and mice with homozygous disruption of the c-CBL locus, we investigated the role of this protein for Bcr-Abl-driven transformation. We find that although c-Cbl(-/-) fibroblast cell lines show a deficit in Bcr-Abl transformation compared to wild-type (Wt) cells, this deficit was less pronounced in c-Cbl(-/-) B cells derived from murine bone marrow.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study comprised the first 193 patients entered onto Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 9761. All had clinically staged T(1-2)N(0)M(0) non-small cell lung cancer, and all underwent curative resections of their primary tumors. Samples of the primary tumor and lymph nodes were taken from lymph node stations 2-12 and shipped to a central laboratory, where each lymph node was histologically processed and stained with H&E as well as with immunohistochemical stain using antibodies to cytokeratin (AE1/3). RESULTS: Altogether, we examined 825 lymph nodes. Whereas routine H&E staining allowed us to detect 18 positive lymph nodes, immunohistochemical staining allowed us to detect 45 positive lymph nodes (P < 0.0001). There were 28 OM [i.e., those detectable only by immunohistochemistry (IHC)], and there was 1 metastasis detected only by H&E staining. The OM included 9 OM in N1 stations and 19 OM in N2 stations. Twelve patients with OM had skip metastases. Routine H&E staining upstaged six patients to N1, and IHC added another five. Routine H&E upstaged 9 patients to N2, and IHC added another 11. We also uncovered new details about the way in which H&E detection depends on metastatic tumor burden. Specifically, for the probability of detecting metastases by H&E to exceed 0.50, the maximum diameter of the metastasis must be greater than 0.23 mm.

A substantial number of leukemia patients harbor nonrandom karyotypic abnormalities that define subgroups with unique biological and clinical features. For detection of these types of gene rearrangements, a combination of multiplex RT-PCR with hybridization on oligonucleotide gel array was presented previously, which identified five chromosomal translocations with fusion variants. In the present study, additional clinically relevant translocations were included in our analysis using a second generation of microarrays. We also expanded significantly on the clinical correlation of our findings. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An oligonucleotide microarray was designed for hybridization with products of a multiplex RT-PCR to identify the following translocations: t(9;22)p190, t(4;11), t(12;21), t(1;19), typical for acute lymphoblastic leukemia; t(9;22)p210 for chronic myeloid leukemia; and t(8;21), t(15;17), inv16, typical for acute myeloblastic leukemia. RESULTS: To demonstrate the potential clinical application of the method, 247 cases of childhood leukemia were screened, and the above-mentioned gene rearrangements were found in 30% of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay is comparable with the RT-PCR technique, so that it can be used to follow minimal residual disease. The feasibility of an additional refinement of the method, on-chip-multiplex PCR, has been successfully demonstrated by identifying a common translocation, t(9;22), in chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the microarray-based assay can be an effective and reliable tool in the clinical screening of leukemia patients for the presence of specific gene rearrangements with important diagnostic and prognostic implications.

SU11248 is an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor with selectivity for fms-related tyrosine kinase 3/Flk2 (FLT3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/beta, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/2, and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. FLT3 is a promising candidate for targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because activating mutations occur in up to 30% of patients. We conducted an innovative single-dose clinical study with a primary objective to demonstrate inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation by SU11248 in AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-nine AML patients each received a single dose of SU11248, escalated from 50 to 350 mg, in increments of 50 mg and cohorts of three to six patients. FLT3 phosphorylation and plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated at seven time points over 48 h after SU11248 administration, and FLT3 genotype was determined. Study drug-related adverse events occurred in 31% of patients, mainly grade 1 or 2 diarrhea and nausea, at higher dose levels. RESULTS: Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was apparent in 50% of FLT3-wild-type (WT) patients and in 100% of FLT3-mutant patients. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutants showed increased sensitivity relative to FLT3-WT, consistent with preclinical predictions. The primary end point, strong inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in >50% patients, was reached in 200 mg and higher dose cohorts.

As with other malignancies, the accumulation of genetic abnormalities are required for malignant transformation of human lymphocytes. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key biosynthetic enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous malignancies including colon, breast, and lung cancer. There is little data on the potential role of COX-2 in lymphoma pathogenesis. In this study, several B lymphoma cell lines and primary B cells obtained from normal volunteer controls were examined for COX-2 protein expression. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated between an approximately 2.2-4.3-fold increase in COX-2 protein expression relative to primary B cells in all lymphoma cell lines examined. Increased COX-2 phosphorylation was found in the BJAB, BL41, and Raji cells whereas the levels in Daudi, Namalwa, and Ramos did not differ from that of primary B cells. Treatment with 25-100 microM celecoxib (CEL) resulted in decreased proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine in all cell lines examined, and the effect was dose-dependent, and not significantly enhanced by chlorambucil (CHL). The effect of COX-2 inhibition on apoptosis in lymphoma cells was examined and revealed apoptotic induction of greater than 85% in all cell lines examined at 50 microM celecoxib. The pro-apoptotic effect was dose-dependent, and was not significantly enhanced by chlorambucil. Examination of apoptosis-related proteins by immunoblot analysis revealed levels of BCL-2, BCL-X(L), and Bax to be unaffected by celecoxib. In contrast, levels of Akt, MCL-1, and phosphorylated SAP-kinase were all decreased after incubation with 50 microM celecoxib.

FLT3 is also a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family and plays important role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, NK, and dendritic cells. Recently, internal tandem duplication (ITDs) mutations have been found in the juxtamembrane (JM) region of FLT3 receptor expressed by patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The mutations result in the constitutive dimerization and activation of the receptor, contributing to leukemic transformation. KIT and FMS are also frequently expressed in AML and are closely related to FLT3. Thus, similar ITD mutations could also occur in the KIT and/or FMS gene of patients with AML. To explore this possibility, 13 human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines and 44 AML patient samples were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of ITD mutations in the JM region of the KIT or FMS receptor. None of the 13 human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines or 44 AML primary bone marrow samples express ITDs in either KIT or FMS in the JM region that is involved in FLT3 mutations. The 13 cell lines and 44 AML samples were also examined for the possible co-expression of KIT and/or FMS receptors with their respective ligands, as we have seen for FLT3 and its ligand, FL. This co-expression could contribute to leukemic transformation through autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine activation mechanisms. And 6/13 cell lines and 27/44 primary AML samples exhibit co-expression of the KIT receptor and ligand (SCF) while 10/13 cell lines and 35/44 primary AML samples exhibit co-expression of the FMS receptor and ligand (CSF-1). Therefore, while ITD mutations were not found, the findings of co-expression of KIT and/or FMS with their respective ligands implies these receptors might contribute to leukemogenesis in some patients with AML through autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine interactive stimulation.",,"['Zheng, Rui', 'Klang, Kendra', 'Gorin, Norbert C', 'Small, Donald']","['Zheng R', 'Klang K', 'Gorin NC', 'Small D']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Room 253, Bunting-Blaustein Cancer Research Building, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences']",2003/12/05 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/12/05 05:00'],"['2003/12/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S014521260300184X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00184-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Feb;28(2):121-6. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00184-x.,,,"['CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA91177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Leuk Res. 2004 Mar;28(3):217-8.

MDS patients suffer from bone marrow failure because of the expansion of a malignant clone, resulting in abnormal differentiation of blood cells and severe pancytopenias. MDS patients have a high propensity for the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the last few years it has become increasingly clear that MDS is a stem cell disease. Two methods have generally been used to study the clonal origin of MDS bone marrow cells. First, the combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in combination with cell sorting has been used to study MDS specific numerical chromosomal aberrations in various cell types. Secondly, the determination of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIP) in different cell types of female MDS patients has been used to study clonality irrespective of the presence of a disease-specific marker. Both techniques have also been used to monitor treatment efficiency. Both methods showed that a molecular remission occurred in approximately half of the patients who achieved complete clinical remission after intensive antileukemic treatment, depending on the study and the type of treatment. In case of cytogenetic analysis this proved to be of prognostic significance. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques for the determination of clonality at diagnosis as well as for the assessment of treatment efficiency in past and in ongoing clinical trials.

Phase II trials utilizing preoperative chemotherapy in selected patients have achieved complete resection rates of 50%-70% with 3-5 year failure-free survival rates of 15%-33%. Between October 1992 and November 1994, 57 adults (50 of whom were evaluable) with surgically staged IIIA NSCLC and pathologically documented ipsilateral mediastinal nodal involvement (N2) were enrolled in a Cancer and Leukemia Group B randomized trial. Preoperative therapy was thought to be critical to facilitating surgical resectability. For patients randomized to the radiotherapy/surgery/radiotherapy (RSR) arm (n = 24), treatment consisted of preoperative radiation therapy (RT) at 40 Gy, surgery, and then additional RT at 14-20 Gy. For patients randomized to the chemotherapy/surgery/chemotherapy/radiotherapy (CSCR) arm (n = 26), treatment consisted of 2 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide with filgrastim support (PE) followed by surgery, 2 more cycles of PE, then RT 54-60 Gy. The total dose of RT on either arm was 54 Gy if completely resected or 60 Gy if incompletely resected or unresected. Clinical characteristics were well balanced between the two arms. Thoracotomy was performed in 42 patients (84%), 28 (67%) of whom had complete resection. The median failure-free and overall survival rates were 12 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-23 months) and 23 months (95% CI, 19 months-infinity) for the RSR arm and 11 months (95% CI, 5-20 months) and 18 months (95% CI, 12-32 months) for the CSCR arm. The rates of overall and complete surgical resection, downstaging of nodal involvement, and failure-free (P = 0.92) and overall survival (P = 0.41) did not differ between the two treatment arms.

We evaluated effectiveness of the drug on cytogenetic response for monitoring residual disease using fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH), reverse transcription-nested-polymerase chain reaction(RT-nested-PCR) and competitive PCR strategy. Of 9 patients in chronic phase, 7 achieved major cytogenetic response(CR) and 2 achieved minor CR by FISH. In 3 out of 6 patients with complete CR, no BCR/ABL gene was detected by RT-nested-PCR in peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens. Of 4 patients in accelerated phase, 1 achieved complete CR but 3 developed blast crisis. Despite high efficacy of Imatinib, 5 out of 13 patients showed resistance to the drug. To clarify the mechanism of resistance, we have newly developed a method for investigating a point mutation of T315I in tyrosine kinase domain of BCR/ABL gene using RT-PCR restriction digested analysis. None of them showed T315I mutation. The sensitivity of the method was as low as 10 copies of mutant gene.

We sought to determine whether a second HSCT would result in long-term disease-free survival with acceptable toxicity. We evaluated the outcome of a second HSCT with a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in pediatric patients with AML who relapsed after an initial HSCT with a busulfan and cyclophosphamide preparative regimen. Twenty-five patients aged 1.1 to 17.2 years (median, 4.1 years) with AML received a second HSCT for recurrent disease. All patients were conditioned with busulfan and cyclophosphamide for the first HSCT and with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation for the second HSCT. Donor sources for the first HSCT were autologous (n = 11) or allogeneic (n = 14), whereas all donors for the second HSCT were allogeneic (12 matched related, 9 mismatched related, and 4 unrelated). Engraftment after the second HSCT occurred in all patients at median of 19.0 days (range, 11-32 days). The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV graft-versus-host disease was 76% after the second HSCT. Three patients died from regimen-related toxicity before day 100, 9 relapsed at a median of 5.4 months (range, 1.8-34.0 months), and 12 survived a median of 9.1 years (range, 7.0-14.4 years) after the second HSCT. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 100 days, 1 year, and 10 years were 88%, 56%, and 48%, respectively. The disease-free survival rate at 10 years was 44%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that patients who received a second HSCT in relapse had a relative risk of relapse of 7.8 (P =.02) compared with patients who underwent transplantation in remission. In addition, patients who received their second HSCT </=6 months after the first transplantation were at increased risk of relapse (P =.03). These data suggest that second HSCT after a failed initial transplantation results in long-term disease-free survival in one half of children with relapsed AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: RBL-2H3 cells were induced to degranulate in response to compound 48/80 and substance P, as assessed by monitoring the release of the granular enzyme beta-hexosaminidase, by treatment for 7 days with 20 microM quercetin. Responses to concanavalin A and antigen were determined by measuring the beta-hexosaminidase release from cells cultured on fibronectin-coated plates. RESULTS: The beta-hexosaminidase release response to compound 48/80 induced by quercetin treatment was accompanied by a release of lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that degranulation is not the only process triggered by compound 48/80 under these conditions. Quercetin treatment reduced the beta-hexosaminidase release response to concanavalin A. Precoating of the culture wells with rat fibronectin enhanced the beta-hexosaminidase response to calcimycin, but not to concanavalin A. Under these conditions, concanavalin A did not induce a release of lactate dehydrogenase. The responses to c48/80, substance P, calcimycin, concanavalin A and antigen (after IgE pretreatment) were reduced by treatment with cigarette smoke solution obtained from standard and low-tar cigarettes (IR3 and IR5F). The effect of cigarette smoke solution from IR5F cigarettes upon the beta-hexosaminidase release elicited by compound 48/80 (in quercetin-treated cells) and by concanavalin A (in cells cultured on fibronectin-coated wells) could be prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine, but not with either hemoglobin, alpha-tocopherol, catalase or palmitoylethanolamide. N-acetyl-L-cysteine also reduced the effect of cigarette smoke solution upon the degranulation response to antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions used, oxidants present in cigarette smoke solution from IR5F cigarettes reduce the ability of RBL-2H3 cells to degranulate in response to both immunological and non-immunological stimuli.",,"['Fowler, C J', 'Sandberg, M', 'Tiger, G']","['Fowler CJ', 'Sandberg M', 'Tiger G']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, 901 87 Umea, Sweden. cf@pharm.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Despite scientific advances into the epidemiologic, genetic, and biological features of AML, this disease remains fatal to the majority of patients, particularly older individuals. METHODS: We review the biologic and clinical characteristics of AML in the elderly and the treatment options that have emerged for them during the past several years. RESULTS: Several biologic features of AML differ between older and younger individuals. Older patients often have disease that expresses multidrug resistance phenotype and cytogenetic abnormalities, which may be responsible in large part for the poor outcomes observed in older-aged subgroups. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy is associated with a low complete response rate and a high treatment-related mortality in older patients, which explains in part the poorer outcomes in cohorts over 60 years of age. Research into the pathophysiology of AML has revealed an abundance of intracellular signaling events that govern proliferation and survival of the malignant cell. Such discoveries have promoted recognition of new molecular and antigenic targets (eg, Flt-3 kinase, Ras, CD33 antigen) to which therapeutic development may be aimed. CONCLUSIONS: New therapies directed against these unique targets may add to the current arsenal of antileukemic regimens and improve response rates and survival in older patients.",,"['Rathnasabapathy, Ramalingam', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E']","['Rathnasabapathy R', 'Lancet JE']","['James P.

The recent progress in tumor molecular biology has revealed that leukemias are likely to arise from disruption of differentiation of early hematopoietic progenitors that fail to give birth to cell lineage restricted phenotypes. Evidence supporting such mechanisms has been derived from studying bone marrow leukemiogenesis and analyzing differentiation of leukemic cell lines in culture that serve as models of erythroleukemic (murine erythroleukemia [MEL] and human leukemia [K562] cells) and myeloid (human promyelocytic leukemia [HL-60] cells) cell maturation. This paper reviews the current concepts of differentiation, the chemical/pharmacological inducing agents developed thus far, and the mechanisms involved in initiation of leukemic cell differentiation. Emphasis was given on commitment and the cell lineage transcriptional factors as key regulators of terminal differentiation as well as on membrane-mediated events and signaling pathways involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation. The developmental program of MEL cells was presented in considerable depth. It is quite remarkable that the erythrocytic maturation of these cells is orchestrated into specific subprograms and gene expression patterns, suggesting that leukemic cell differentiation represents a highly coordinated set of events that lead to irreversible growth arrest and expression of cell lineage restricted phenotypes. In MEL and other leukemic cells, differentiation appears to be accompanied by differentiation-dependent apoptosis (DDA), an event that can be exploited chemotherapeutically. The mechanisms by which the chemical inducers promote differentiation of leukemic cells have been discussed.",,"['Tsiftsoglou, Asterios S', 'Pappas, Ioannis S', 'Vizirianakis, Ioannis S']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Pappas IS', 'Vizirianakis IS']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GR-54124, Greece. tsif@pharm.auth.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0163725803001372 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pharmthera.2003.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 2003 Dec;100(3):257-90. doi: 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2003.09.002.,,,,,,418,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell specific expression of TAL1 in mice induces aggressive T cell malignancies, demonstrating the oncogenic potential of TAL1. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of TAL1 induced tumorigenesis are poorly understood. By inhibiting E protein mediated transcription of the pTalpha gene, TAL1 can interfere with the T cell differentiation program. In addition, several studies suggest that TAL1 expression might also enhance proliferation rate. We report here that TAL1 can bind the E boxes in both the p16 and the pTalpha promoters, and functionally suppress the activity of both promoters. These results indicate that TAL1 can affect both T cell proliferation and differentiation.

These agents have been associated with treatment-related acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This article reviews the medical literature concerning the incidence, causes, and natural history of treatment-related AML/MDS, with emphasis on the association of these factors with alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, growth factors, and radiation treatment. Data from 6 completed adjuvant National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trials that tested regimens containing doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were reviewed to characterize the incidence of treatment-related AML/MDS. The regimens differed in cyclophosphamide intensity, cumulative cyclophosphamide dose, and the presence or absence of mandated prophylactic support with growth factor and ciprofloxacin. Rates were compared across regimens, by patient age, and by treatment with or without adjuvant in-breast radiation therapy (RT). The relative risk (RR) for the development of treatment-related AML/MDS was greater for patients undergoing the more-intense regimens than for those undergoing standard AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) regimens (RR, 6.16; P<0.0001). Risk correlated more closely with dose intensity than with cumulative dose, and the data suggested that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) dose may also be independently correlated with increased risk. Patients who received in-breast RT experienced more secondary AML/MDS than those who did not (RR, 2.38; P=0.006). Patients treated with AC with intensified doses of cyclophosphamide requiring G-CSF support had increased rates of treatment-related AML/MDS, even though the incidence was slight relative to breast cancer relapse.

First, gene expression profiles are summarized by optimally selected Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), followed by tumor sample classification by Fuzzy C-means clustering. Then, the prediction of marker genes is accomplished by either manual feature selection (visualizing the weighted/mean SOM component plane) or automatic feature selection (by pair-wise Fisher's linear discriminant). RESULTS: The proposed models were tested on four published datasets: (1) Leukemia (2) Colon cancer (3) Brain tumors and (4) NCI cancer cell lines. The models gave class prediction with markedly reduced error rates compared to other class prediction approaches, and the importance of feature selection on microarray data analysis was also emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: Our models identify marker genes with predictive potential, often better than other available methods in the literature. The models are potentially useful for medical diagnostics and may reveal some insights into cancer classification. Additionally, we illustrated two limitations in tumor classification from microarray data related to the biology underlying the data, in terms of (1) the class size of data, and (2) the internal structure of classes.

It is a tight-binding inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme essential in the cellular metabolism of purines. Children with congenital absence of ADA suffer from atrophy of lymphoid tissues and severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome. It was hypothesized that pentostatin would be lymphocytotoxic and this proved to be true; this finding prompted its investigation in lymphoid neoplasms. It was anticipated that pentostatin would be most active in neoplasms with high intracellular concentrations of ADA, e.g. acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), particularly of the T-cell variety. Although pentostatin proved to be active in ALL, large doses were required and major toxic effects outweighed therapeutic benefits. By contrast, pentostatin proved to be exceptionally active in hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a B-cell neoplasm with low intracellular concentrations of ADA. Pentostatin has since been shown to possess activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, adult T-cell lymphoma-leukemia, and low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. It potentiates the activity of vidarabine against viruses and against the cells of acute myeloid leukemia. Pentostatin is inactive in melanoma and renal carcinoma, but has not been adequately evaluated in other solid tumors. The toxic effects of pentostatin include renal failure, central nervous system (CNS) depression, immunosuppresion, keratoconjunctivitis, and opportunistic infections. In the absence of pre-existing bone marrow compromise, pentostatin produces only mild myelosuppression. Aside from its use as an antineoplastic agent, pentostatin has potential applications as an immunosuppressive drug, as an antiviral agent, as an antimalarial compound, and in the protection of cells of the CNS from damage induced by ischemia and anoxia. Clinical studies with pentostatin are ongoing, and its roles in the management of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases have yet to be fully defined.",,"['Spiers, A S']",['Spiers AS'],"['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reanalyzed the mortality of 1,658 males (follow up 1972-1995; 35,626 person years; 170 deaths) by Poisson regression, adjusting for age, age at hiring, calendar period, length of exposure and latency. We calculated the relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PVC baggers (n. = 197), PVC compound (n. = 403) and autoclave (n. = 209) workers. As an internal reference we used two groups of workers: technicians and employees (main reference: n. = 202 subjects), with the group of other blue collar workers (n. = 639) added for statistical purposes only (minor reference: n. = 841 subjects). RESULTS: Pooling the four subgroups of exposed workers, the comparison with the main reference group allowed us to detect increased mortality from all causes of death (RR = 2.09; CI = 1.09-4.00; 160 deaths), all tumours (RR = 1.53; ns; 81 deaths), lung cancer (RR = 2.05; ns; 29 deaths) and cardiovascular diseases (RR = 3.57; ns; 29 deaths). The analysis for each specific subgroup revealed increased mortality from all causes of death among both PVC baggers (RR = 2.66; CI = 1.27-5.59) and PVC compound workers (RR = 2.68; CI = 1.36-5.27). Comparison of the minor reference group with the overall population of exposed workers showed increased RRs for other diseases, namely, liver tumour (RR = 4.08; ns; 9 deaths), lymphomas and leukaemia (RR = 2.97; ns; 7 deaths) and liver cirrhosis (RR = 3.30; ns; 11 deaths). The analysis for each specific subgroup revealed significantly increased RR for all tumours among PVC compound workers (RR = 1.74; CI = 1.06-2.85), for lung cancer among PVC baggers workers (RR = 3.04; CI = 1.15-7.99) and for liver cancer (RR = 9.57; CI = 1.69-54.1) and liver cirrhosis (RR = 6.32; CI = 1.37-29.07) among autoclave workers. In addition, the two deaths from brain tumour were observed among PVC compound workers. CONCLUSIONS: To highlight the risk previously reported in the literature and to reduce the possible dilution effect (due to comparison bias, healthy worker effect), it proved methodologically pivotal to separate exposed and probably unexposed workers (considered as an internal reference group).",,"['Gennaro, Valerio', 'Ceppi, Marcello', 'Montanaro, Fabio']","['Gennaro V', 'Ceppi M', 'Montanaro F']","['Servizio di epidemiologia ambientale e biostatistica, Istituto nazionale per la ricerca sul cancro, Largo R.

However, the overall utility of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not well defined. For instance, it is not known how well this antibody will target extramedullary disease. This article reports gemtuzumab treatment of refractory AML in a 32-year-old man. At the time of recurrence, his bone marrow was hypoplastic and without leukemia, but the condition progressed resulting in marked leukemic infiltration of the oral mucosa. This case history raises the possibility that leukemic sanctuary sites may exist, and that monoclonal antibody therapy may have sub-optimal activity in non-medullary sites of disease.",,"['Sollecito, Thomas P', 'Draznin, Julia', 'Parisi, Ernesta', 'Duffy, Kathleen', 'Stadtmauer, Edward A', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Schuster, Stephen J', 'Tsai, Donald', 'Porter, David L']","['Sollecito TP', 'Draznin J', 'Parisi E', 'Duffy K', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Luger SM', 'Schuster SJ', 'Tsai D', 'Porter DL']","['Division of Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, 4001 Spruce Street, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. tps@pobox.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Spec Care Dentist,"Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",8103755,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",,"['Adult', 'Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Gingiva/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Treatment Failure']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1754-4505.2003.tb01670.x [doi]'],ppublish,Spec Care Dentist. 2003;23(3):108-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1754-4505.2003.tb01670.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of residual disease at defined timepoints by cytomorphology can provide specific prognostic information, which allows to define new risk groups. Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) by identifying clone-specific T-cell receptor- (TCR) or immunglobuline (Ig) gene rearrangements is currently being evaluated to extend this approach of testing the individual's sucsceptibility to therapy. The high sensitivity of the method when indicating fast clearance of leukemia might eventually spare some patients of inadequately toxic therapy.

It is considered to be a hematopoiesis-specific gene that is expressed during the ontogeny of hematopoiesis. Herein, we characterize two distinct splicing variants of HEMGN mRNA with restricted expression to hematopoietic cells and to round spermatids in the testis, respectively. Expression of the testis-specific HEMGN mRNA (HEMGN-t) is developmentally regulated and is concurrent with the first wave of meiosis in prepuberal mice. Sequence analysis reveals that HEMGN-t and the hematopoietic HEMGN mRNA (HEMGN-h) share a common coding sequence with distinct 5' and 3' untranslated regions and that these two isoforms are transcribed from the same gene locus, HEMGN, through the use of alternative promoters and polyadenylation sites. Thus, HEMGN expression exemplifies a developmental regulatory mechanism by which the diversification of gene expression is achieved through using distinct regulatory sequences in different cell types. Moreover, the existence of a testis-specific isoform of HEMGN suggests a role in spermatogenesis. Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrates that HEMGN is localized to chromosome 4 A5-B2 in mouse and to chromosome 9q22 in human, which is a region known to harbor a cluster of leukemia breakpoints.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Yang, Li V', 'Heng, Henry H', 'Wan, Junmei', 'Southwood, Cherie M', 'Gow, Alexander', 'Li, Li']","['Yang LV', 'Heng HH', 'Wan J', 'Southwood CM', 'Gow A', 'Li L']","['Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. lili@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (HEMGN protein, human)', '0 (Hemgn protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", ""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Polyadenylation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spermatids/metabolism', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Testis/metabolism']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvdy.10399 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2003 Dec;228(4):606-16. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.10399.,,,"['R01 HL058916/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL58916-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its ligand, CD137L, in addition to its ability to costimulate T cells, signals back into antigen presenting cells promoting their activation and differentiation. Recently, CD137 has been proposed as a therapeutic target to improve and sustain anticancer immune response. Several activated T leukemia and B lymphoma cell lines expressed CD137 or CD137L, respectively, and soluble CD137L has been found in sera of leukemia patients. However, the functionality and role of these costimulatory molecules in hematologic malignancies are until now unknown. Interestingly, we observed constitutive CD137 and CD137L coexpression on both human T and B leukemia cell lines. The constitutive CD137 expression on unstimulated T or B leukemia cells presents some differences compared to CD137 expressed on PMA/ionomycin-activated T leukemia cells. Surprisingly, in spite of the low expression level, both tumor CD137 and CD137L molecules signaled in T and B leukemia cells inducing proliferation and prolonging survival. In addition, CD137/CD137L system ligation opposed the anticancer drug cytotoxic effects, reducing the apoptotic DNA fragmentation and stimulating proliferation of doxorubicin-escaped leukemia cells. Although the role of leukemia CD137/CD137L system in vivo is unknown, these data suggest that these costimulatory molecules might confer an advantage to hematologic tumors promoting survival, sustaining cellular growth and contributing to drug resistance.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Palma, Carla', 'Binaschi, Monica', 'Bigioni, Mario', 'Maggi, Carlo Alberto', 'Goso, Cristina']","['Palma C', 'Binaschi M', 'Bigioni M', 'Maggi CA', 'Goso C']","['Department of Pharmacology, Menarini Ricerche SpA, Rome, Italy. pharmacology@menarini-ricerche.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11574 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Jan 20;108(3):390-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11574.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to transplantation the potential risk of HCMV disease is therefore determined by HCMV-antibody blood testing of transplant donor (D) and recipient (R). Virus carriers are positive for anti-CMV-IgG. Virus patterns are distinguished as follows: group 1 (D+/R+), group 2 (D-/R+), group 3 (D+/R-), and group 4 (D-/R-). AIM: The aim of this study was qualitative and quantitative determination of the HCMV DNA load in saliva of BM and SC transplantation patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Unstimulated saliva was collected from 20 patients prior to BM and SC transplantation, during the time of conditioning, and after transplantation. DNA was isolated and analyzed for evidence of HCMV DNA with TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: HCMV DNA was isolated in seven cases. In all group 1 patients (D+/R+) HCMV DNA could be demonstrated. Only three of seven group 2 patients (D-/R+) were positive for HCMV DNA. The only group 3 patient (D+/R-) and all eight group 4 patients (D-/R-) were negative. CONCLUSION: TaqMan PCR is a reliable method for HCMV DNA quantification. In three patients (anti-HCMV-IgG positive) who received an anti-CMV-IgG negative transplant HCMV DNA was isolated. In contrast, no HCMV-DNA was evident in HCMV-negative patients who received an HCMV-negative transplant. Accordingly, the risk of HCMV reactivation is more probable than the risk of reinfection.",,"['Rhinow, K', 'Schmidt-Westhausen, A M', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Pauli, G', 'Schetelig, J', 'Siegert, W']","['Rhinow K', 'Schmidt-Westhausen AM', 'Ellerbrok H', 'Pauli G', 'Schetelig J', 'Siegert W']","['Zentrum fur Zahnmedizin, Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Universitatsmedizin. katja.rhinow@charite.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Mund Kiefer Gesichtschir,"Mund-, Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie : MKG",9716576,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/virology', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva/*virology', 'Taq Polymerase']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/04/22 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10006-003-0506-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Mund Kiefer Gesichtschir. 2003 Nov;7(6):361-4. doi: 10.1007/s10006-003-0506-8.

The resistance might play an essential role in the escape from the host immune surveillance; however, it has not been directly demonstrated that HCCs are actually resistant to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated death. Therefore, this study investigated the molecular mechanism of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against the HCCs, HepG2, and Hep3B, using two distinct cytotoxic assays: a 4-h (51)Cr-release assay and a 2-h [(3)H] thymidine release assay which selectively measures the extent of necrotic and apoptotic target cell death, respectively. METHODS: Most of the target cells exhibited marked morphologic changes when they were co-incubated with the NK cells, and the NK cytotoxicity against these HCCs was comparable to that against K562, a NK-sensitive leukemia cell line, when the cytotoxicity was assessed by a 4-h (51)Cr release assay. RESULTS: The NK cells also induced significant apoptotic cell death in the Hep3B targets, but not in the HepG2 targets, when the cytotoxicity was assessed by a 2-h [(3)H]-thymidine release assay. In agreement with these results, procaspase-3 was activated in the Hep3B targets, but not in the HepG2 targets. Interestingly, mildly fixed NK cells had no detectable activity in the 4-h (51)Cr release assay against both HepG2 and Hep3B targets, while they were similarly effective as the untreated NK cells in the 2-h [(3)H]-thymidine release assay, suggesting that the level of apoptotic cell death of the Hep3B targets is granule independent and might be primarily mediated by the death ligands of the NK cells. CONCLUSION: This study found that a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL)/TRAIL receptor interaction is involved in the NK cell-mediated apoptotic death of the Hep3B targets, but a Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interaction is not.",,"['Kim, Hyoung-Ran', 'Park, Hyun-Joo', 'Park, Jeon Han', 'Kim, Se Jong', 'Kim, Kunhong', 'Kim, Jongsun']","['Kim HR', 'Park HJ', 'Park JH', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim K', 'Kim J']","['Department of Microbiology and Brain Korea 21 Project for Medical Sciences, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 134 Shinchon-dong, Seodaemoon-gu, 120-752 Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*immunology/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-003-0461-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2004 May;53(5):461-70. doi: 10.1007/s00262-003-0461-0.
