The sensitivity of this method is in the order of 0.1% Y-bearing nuclei in male recipients transplanted with female marrow. In female recipients of male marrow, the detection of low numbers of non-Y-bearing nuclei is less sensitive. The presence of host cells in blood and bone marrow of seven patients (four males, three females) was investigated with respect to successful engraftment or recurrence of the disease. The results obtained were compared with cytology (all seven cases) and with conventional cytogenetics (five cases). In five patients, the results of Y-FISH and cytology were identical. In two patients, low numbers of male host cells were detected in the marrow by Y-FISH, whereas cytology indicated complete remission of the disease. In three patients Y-FISH and cytogenetic data were similar, but in two patients Y-FISH revealed the presence of 0.2% and 7% male host cells, respectively, in bone marrow, whereas cytogenetics indicated a 100% female marrow in both cases. Because the hybridization was performed in situ, the morphology of the nuclei was preserved. To differentiate between normal and leukemic cells, the size of the blast cell nuclei appeared to be a very useful indicator.

Nucleotide sequence analysis predicts both rac1 and rac2 proteins to contain 192 amino acids with molecular masses of 21,450 and 21,429 daltons, respectively. rac1 and rac2 possess four of the five conserved functional domains in ras associated with binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides. They also contain the COOH-terminal consensus sequence Cys-X-X-X-COOH which localizes ras to the inner plasma membrane and the residues Gly12 and Ala59, at which sites mutations elicit transforming potential to ras. The rac transcripts, particularly rac2, display relative myeloid tissue selectivity. Both rac1 transcripts (2.4 and 1.1 kilobases (kb] increase when HL-60 cells differentiate to neutrophil-like morphology. In contrast, differentiation of U937 cells to monocyte-like morphology causes no change in the 2.4-kb mRNA and a decrease in the 1.1-kb mRNA species. rac2 mRNA (1.45 kb) increases 7-9-fold and 3-fold upon differentiation of HL-60 and U937 cells, respectively. Neither rac mRNAs are present in a Jurkat T cell line, and unlike rac1, rac2 mRNA is absent in human brain and liver tissue. Transfection experiments permitted the demonstration that rac1 and rac2 are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by the C3 component of botulinum toxin.

Actual TBI doses delivered to these patients varied between 839 and 1250 cGy (mean 956 +/- 101)/3 fr/3d, with dose rates between 2.7 and 7.25 cGy/min (mean 4.2 +/- 1.8). Patients receiving high (greater than 990 cGy) and low (less than or equal to 990) dose and/or dose rate (greater than 4 cGy/min and less than or equal to 4, respectively) have been evaluated overall and stratified by type of leukemia and phase of disease. When the patients are considered altogether, high total dose is significantly correlated with decreased risk of relapse (p = 0.0005) as well as high dose rate (p = 0.03). When considering specific subgroups, the influence of total dose on relapse rate is evident both for ""early"" and ""advanced"" leukemias, while an impact of dose rate appears only for chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1st chronic phase. Pertinent radiobiological and clinical literature is reviewed, and a possible role of dose fractionation and dose rate in leukemic control rate is evidenced; in this TBI setting, total dose not less than 990 cGy/3fr/3d and dose rate not less than 4 cGy/min have to be guaranteed.","['Scarpati, D', 'Frassoni, F', 'Vitale, V', 'Corvo, R', 'Franzone, P', 'Barra, S', 'Guenzi, M', 'Orsatti, M']","['Scarpati D', 'Frassoni F', 'Vitale V', 'Corvo R', 'Franzone P', 'Barra S', 'Guenzi M', 'Orsatti M']","[""Istituto di Radiologia dell'Universita' di Genova, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(89)90105-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(89)90105-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Sep;17(3):547-52. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(89)90105-3.,,,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunogold labelling of myristoylated Pr55gage with antibodies directed against HIV Gag products was apparent in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. On the contrary, non-myristoylated derivatives of Pr55gag were only detected in relatively well-defined regions of the cytoplasm.

When after radio-iodination of the associated proteins, such DNA is electrophoresed on agarose and the gel is subsequently subjected to autoradiography, the protein components of three or four complexes are visualized. Their two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis revealed that each possesses a simple but specific polypeptide composition, including a set of five non-histone proteins, characteristic for the matrix, and the core histones H3 and H4. Since the polypeptides dissociate from DNA by treatment with SDS, it is suggested that the linkage is not covalent. Reassociation and hybridization analysis of the DNA of the complexes indicated that it is enriched in highly repetitive, satellite sequences. The latter were found to be, to a great extent, similar to sequences localized at the base of large, dehistonized DNA loops obtained by high-salt extraction of isolated nuclei. Further experiments emphasized the complete conservation of this type of attachment throughout erythroid differentiation of Friend cells. It is proposed that the complexes represent attachment sites of basic, 30-100-kbp loop units of DNA.","['Patriotis, C', 'Djondjurov, L']","['Patriotis C', 'Djondjurov L']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histones/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15002.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Sep 1;184(1):157-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15002.x.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional and structural similarities and the 7F7-reactivity of pICAM-1 transfected COS-cells prove that 7F7-antigen is identical with ICAM-1. The expression of both adhesion structures occurred variably and clearly depended on the maturation stage and on the B and T cell origin of lymphomas but was not associated with the proliferative status of tumour cells. The concomitant expression of both adhesion molecules was a characteristic feature of germinal centre derived NHL, particularly of those with neoplastic follicular structures (corr. contingency coeff. = 0.506; P less than 0.02), whereas both adhesion structures were less often expressed on lymphomas with a more diffuse pattern of tumour infiltration. Most B-NHL of low-grade malignancy expressed LFA-1 while their counterparts of high-grade malignancy often tended to be LFA-1 negative. In B cell neoplasias of low-grade malignancy the lack of ICAM-1 and a leukaemic course of the disease were significantly correlated (P less than 0.0005).

Other purified recombinant lymphokines were also tested for their ability to induce BCL1 proliferation. The lymphokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-6 had no effect on the growth of BCL1. In contrast, IL-4 and more surprisingly granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also induced proliferation of this cell.

In experiments designed to explore the potential mechanism of RB tumor suppression, we report here that the phosphorylation state of RB protein is modulated during normal cellular events. In resting cells, RB protein is present in its least phosphorylated form; in rapidly proliferating cells, RB protein is highly phosphorylated. Maximal phosphorylation is associated with S phase of the cell cycle. Induction of differentiation in several human leukemia cell lines by treatment with phorbol ester or retinoic acid leads to dephosphorylation of RB. Time course studies indicate that RB dephosphorylation precedes the total arrest of cell growth during differentiation.

It is well established that mismatching for either HLA or minor antigens increases the risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure. In HLA-identical sibling transplants minor antigen differences may be responsible for these problems, which might be reduced by matching for minor antigens and improving methods for immunosuppression in vivo. If a suitable family member is not available, then a 'matched' unrelated donor (MUD) may be an alternative. At present MUD transplants have greater risks of GVHD and graft failure and consequently poor survival than HLA-identical sibling transplants; this may be due to unrecognized MHC polymorphisms or to multiple minor H differences. Possible strategies to improve the results of MUD transplants include better HLA matching, new in vitro functional tests for optimizing donor selection and better immunosuppression. Approaches for improving HLA typing include isoelectric focusing for class I and RFLP/allogenotyping or oligonucleotide typing for class II antigens. One obvious disadvantage of exploiting more precise methods for donor matching is the possibility of excluding donors with biologically unimportant histocompatibility differences, which would increase rather than reduce the proportion of patients without donors in a given panel. Functional assays could help in selecting donors on the basis of 'intelligent mismatching' within the HLA system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kaminski, E R']",['Kaminski ER'],"['Department of Immunology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Mice']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Jul;4(4):439-44.,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At concentrations between 1.1 and 28.5 microM, the [3H]dThd incorporation rates in L5178y cells were suppressed to 28%-0% but only to 78%-18% in murine spleen lymphocytes. The same differential effect in vitro was found with the following epithelial cells: 14.70 microM of the compound were required to inhibit normal human fibroblasts to 50%, but only 2.9 microM in the assays with human malign keratinocytes or malignant melanoma cells to observe the same inhibitory effect.

The in vitro studies indicate a high resistance of the enzyme to different kinds of heat treatment.","['Hafenrichter, R', 'Weiland, F', 'Schneider, J', 'Thiel, H J']","['Hafenrichter R', 'Weiland F', 'Schneider J', 'Thiel HJ']","['Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals, Tubingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Temperature', 'Viral Proteins/ultrastructure']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90139-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1989 Sep;172(1):355-8. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90139-6.,,,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2 receptor expression is strongly associated with several forms of human lymphoproliferative disease including adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma in which it may play a pathogenetic role. IL-2 receptor expression may also play a role in some B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and histiocytic proliferations. Recent discoveries in immunology and advances in biotechnology have opened therapeutic possibilities for IL-2 including the use of anti-Tac monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugates for the therapy of Tac-positive lymphoproliferative disease, the use of anti-Tac monoclonal antibodies as novel immunosuppressants, and the use of genetically engineered recombinant IL-2 and activated autologous lymphocytes in the adoptive immunotherapy of cancer.

In Hodgkin's disease-associated glomerulopathy, a defect in the function of T lymphocytes is probably important, but the precise pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated.

The rate declined to 0.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.7) after one year. The age-adjusted incidence of secondary cancer was 6.69 times higher than that of primary cancer in the general population. In a multivariate model, the predictors (and relative risks) of any type of secondary cancer were acute graft-versus-host disease treated with either antithymocyte globulin (relative risk, 4.2) or an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (13.6) and total-body irradiation (3.9). Two additional factors were associated with secondary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: T-lymphocyte depletion of donor marrow (12.4) and HLA mismatch (3.8).

Three children were treated immediately after grafting with low dose cyclosporine for four to six months. Five to 10 months after BMT, four patients developed a hemolytic uremic syndrome with severe hypertension. The remaining three were found to have isolated renal insufficiency several months post-BMT. In the seven patients, renal biopsy showed a uniform pattern of severe glomerular involvement characterized by extensive lesions of mesangiolysis associated with severe arteriolonecrosis. A repeat biopsy performed one year later, in two patients showed severe scarring of the renal parenchyma with minor lesions of mesangiolysis. The similarity of the pathologic features observed suggests that the same mechanism might have been operative in the seven patients.

Although bone marrow samples were markedly hypocellular on day 7 posttransplant, myeloid and erythroid elements were seen in 5 of 6 patients. Peripheral blood recovery of these 5 patients was achieved by third weeks posttransplant. The values of (CFU-GM) per 1 X 10(5) marrow mononuclear cells reached normal values on day 7 in two patients and significantly increased by day 28 in a patient. After day 84 the values of (CFU-GM) were remained almost normal and they had no relation to the occurrence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Impairment of one of these marrow compartments will result in marrow failure. Total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is becoming an established modality in the treatment of malignant hematopoietic disorders. The objectives of irradiation are to ablate host marrow and immunocompetent cells as well as to eradicate neoplastic cells. Although leukemic cells are thought to have the same radiobiological characteristics as their normal counterparts, it has been proposed recently that some leukemic cells may possess a substantial capacity to repair sublethal radiation damage. Thus, radiation administered at different dose rates or fractions might differ in its ability to ablate malignant cells and consequently affect the relapse rate in the post-transplant period. Different modes of irradiation can also affect the proliferative capacity and the hematopoietic supportive function of the marrow microenvironment. Bone marrow ablation must be accomplished with the least possible damage to other tissues. Impairment of the proliferative capacity of the marrow microenvironment or its hematopoietic supportive function can result in graft failure in the post-transplant period.

It is induced to differentiate by exposure to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We have developed a mutant phorbol ester-tolerant (PET) line of HL-60 which undergoes a transient growth arrest but does not differentiate when exposed to TPA (Macfarlane et al., Br. J. Haematol., 68: 291-302, 1988). The defect is not due to a general failure of TPA-induced phosphorylation. In this paper, we show that exposing phorbol ester-sensitive (S) HL-60 cells to TPA caused the disappearance of the c-myc protein antigen (detected on Western blots) in 4 h, whereas TPA had no effect on the c-myc protein content of PET cells. Dimethyl sulfoxide caused the rapid disappearance of the myc antigen in both cells. PET cells had slightly more copies of the c-myc gene detected on Southern blots than S cells. c-myc mRNA was equally unstable in both cells, as determined by Northern blots following actinomycin D. TPA induced the down-regulation of c-myc mRNA in S cells to a greater extent than in PET cells. Dimethyl sulfoxide caused a rapid down-regulation of c-myc mRNA in both cell lines. This shows that PET cells have a defect in the mechanism by which protein kinase C regulates c-myc transcription. Our results provide further evidence that reduction in c-myc expression is necessary for differentiation to occur in HL-60 cells.","['Gailani, D', 'Cadwell, F J', ""O'Donnell, P S"", 'Hromas, R A', 'Macfarlane, D E']","['Gailani D', 'Cadwell FJ', ""O'Donnell PS"", 'Hromas RA', 'Macfarlane DE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Iowa City Veterans Administration Medical Center, Iowa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Amplification/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 1;49(19):5329-33.,,['HL 07344/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients greater than or equal to 1 year and less than or equal to 21 years of age who attained complete remission were stratified by conventional risk criteria and immunophenotype and then randomized to receive continuation therapy with either of two regimens of intensive chemotherapy, designated S (standard) and SAM (standard plus intermediate-dose methotrexate, 1 g/m2 every 8 weeks). The proportions of subjects achieving complete remission in the two phenotypically defined subgroups were identical, 96%. At a median follow-up time of 42 months, the overall probability of 4-year event-free survival (+/- SE) was 63% +/- 2% (pre-B = 51% +/- 5% and early pre-B = 66% +/- 3%). Children with pre-B ALL had significantly shorter durations of continuous complete remission (P = .0004); this association included both bone marrow and CNS remissions (P = .0004 and P = .02, respectively). In a univariate Cox regression analysis of potentially important prognostic factors, the pre-B immunophenotype was significantly related to a poorer outcome, as were other recognized biologic and clinical features (eg, pseudodiploidy, older age, male sex, black race, and a higher WBC). It retained its prognostic strength in a multivariate model based on age, WBC, ploidy, and sex. The risk of failure at any point in the clinical course of a child with the pre-B immunophenotype was 1.8 times as great as that in a patient lacking this feature but otherwise having an equivalent risk status. It should be stressed that the predictive value of any of the significant characteristics identified in this study could diminish in the context of another, more effective treatment program. Nevertheless, our major conclusion, that children with pre-B ALL fare worse than those with early pre-B disease in a contemporary clinical trial has implications for stratified randomization of patients and the design of risk-specific treatment protocols.","['Crist, W', 'Boyett, J', 'Jackson, J', 'Vietti, T', 'Borowitz, M', 'Chauvenet, A', 'Winick, N', 'Ragab, A', 'Mahoney, D', 'Head, D']","['Crist W', 'Boyett J', 'Jackson J', 'Vietti T', 'Borowitz M', 'Chauvenet A', 'Winick N', 'Ragab A', 'Mahoney D', 'Head D', 'et al.']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/classification/drug effects/immunology', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/drug therapy/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Remission Induction']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82572-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Sep;74(4):1252-9.,,"['CA-05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial fraction of the gp70 that was bound specifically by these criteria remained undegraded and accessible to extracellular labeling reagents for many hours. Accordingly, cells with ecotropic receptors could be labeled specifically. As seen by immunofluorescence microscopy, the gp70-receptor complexes were uniformly dispersed on mouse fibroblast plasma membranes. These complexes were mobile, and they aggregated into patches when crosslinked by antibodies at 37 degrees, but not when membrane lipid fluidity was frozen at 0 degrees. Ecotropic receptors still bound gp70 specifically after cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, but these receptors could not be patched, indicating that they were nondiffusible. Viable cells slowly endocytosed gp70-receptor complexes at 37 degrees (approximate half-life 5-7 hr) and the gp70 was then proteolytically degraded in lysosomes. In the presence of 20 microM chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, undegraded gp70 was seen to slowly accumulate in these intracellular organelles. These results suggest that ecotropic receptors mediate a slow internalization of attached ligand. Long-lived binding of gp70 onto surfaces of uninfected cells may explain important features of viral-induced leukemia, the host immune response, and immunosuppression.","['Kabat, D']",['Kabat D'],"['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endocytosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lysosomes/physiology', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rauscher Virus/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/metabolism', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90616-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1989 Aug;171(2):467-74. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90616-8.,,['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was divided in three periods: 1967 to 1975, 1976 to 1982, and 1983 to 1987. Three induction schedules were used during the first two periods, and different maintenance schemes alternating with monthly consolidations were explored; the value of immunotherapy with C. Parvum and androgen therapy with stanozolol was also tested. Protocol 3-AML-83, representing the third period, included a four-week induction phase with vincristine, adriamycin, cytosine-arabinoside, prednisone and 6-mercaptopurine, followed by a consolidation phase with cyclophosphamide, cytosine-arabinoside and 6-mercaptopurine for four weeks. Maintenance phase included daily, oral 6-mercaptopurine, and monthly cytosine-arabinoside, both during two years, and adriamycin every eighth week, for one year. Complete remission rates for the first two periods of therapy were 40% and 55%, whereas that of the last period was 74%. The overall results of the period 1967-1982, showed actuarial duration rates of complete remission, event-free survival and survival, at 60 months, between 2% and 6%, their median duration being of 9, 8 and 10 months respectively. No significant difference was observed between the first two periods or protocols. Protocol 3-AML-83, activated in March 1983, achieved actuarial rates of continuous complete remission, event-free survival, and survival of 51%, 37% and 39% respectively, at 48 months.

The present study is an attempt to assess whether, as side-effects, these aggressive treatments result in cognitive performance deficits, and if so, whether such changes recover posttreatment. Measurement of cognitive ability in this situation presents special problems not encountered with one-time tests intended for healthy adults. Such tests must be sensitive to changes within a single individual, which emphasizes the crucial importance of high reliability, stability across repeated-measures, and resistance to confounding factors such as motivation and fatigue. The present research makes use of a microbased portable test battery developed to have reliable and sensitive tests which were adapted to study the special requirements of transplant patients who may suffer cognitive deficits as a result of treatment. The results showed slight but significant changes in neuropsychological capacity when compared to baseline levels and controls, particularly near the beginning of treatment. The sensitivity of the battery in detecting such subtle temporary changes is discussed in terms of past research showing effects of other stressors, such as stimulated high altitude and ingestion of alcohol, on these measures.","['Parth, P', 'Dunlap, W P', 'Kennedy, R S', 'Ordy, J M', 'Lane, N E']","['Parth P', 'Dunlap WP', 'Kennedy RS', 'Ordy JM', 'Lane NE']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Percept Mot Skills,Perceptual and motor skills,0401131,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*etiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Postoperative Complications/*etiology', 'Psychomotor Disorders/*etiology', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology', 'Substance-Related Disorders/etiology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2466/pms.1989.68.3c.1227 [doi]'],ppublish,Percept Mot Skills. 1989 Jun;68(3 Pt 2):1227-41. doi: 10.2466/pms.1989.68.3c.1227.,,['CA38552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Neuroscience', 'Non-NASA Center']",['Kennedy RS'],"['Kennedy, R S']","['Essex Corp, Orlando, FL']",,,

Through analysis of recombinant vectors expressing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene we found that two promoters map to the 5'-portion of the human p53 oncogene. One promoter, p53p1, maps upstream of the non-coding first exon and the second, p53p2, maps within the first intron. By primer extension analysis of cellular RNA from a number of human cell lines, we found that p53p2 is a functional promoter in vivo. In order to test whether differential regulation of these promoters may be correlated with the control of expression of the p53 gene during differentiation, we have measured the activity of the two promoters by their ability to direct expression of the CAT gene during terminal differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. HL-60 cells stably harboring Epstein-Barr virus-derived recombinant plasmids that express the CAT gene from either p53p1 or p53p2 were induced to undergo terminal differentiation by a variety of chemical inducers to either granulocytes or monocytes and expression of the CAT gene was measured. The results indicate that while expression of p53p1 remained constant, expression from p53p2 was induced 5- to 10-fold during differentiation of these cells to either granulocytes or monocytes. Similarly, the endogenous p53p2 was found to be induced in HL-60 cells undergoing differentiation. Although the product of the p53p2 initiated transcript has not yet been characterized these results indicate that altered regulation of these two promoters may be important in modulating the expression of mRNA from this gene during terminal differentiation.","['Reisman, D', 'Rotter, V']","['Reisman D', 'Rotter V']","['Department of Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Aug;4(8):945-53.,,['IR01 CA4003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with previous studies, a comparable pattern and frequency of ras mutation was found amongst 45 cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia. By contrast, of 30 cases of mature B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, only one in terminal prolymphocytoid transformation harboured an activated ras gene. These patterns of mutation did not correlate with ras gene methylation state, a finding not obviously compatible with differential gene accessibility being an important determinant of ras gene mutation patterns in leukemogenesis. Our data suggest that activated ras is more important in tumourigenesis of immature than mature lymphocyte progenitors whilst similar mechanisms associated with aetiology and/or target cell susceptibility probably underlie the similar patterns of ras gene mutations seen in acute leukemias of both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages.","['Browett, P J', 'Norton, J D']","['Browett PJ', 'Norton JD']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Hampstead, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Restriction Mapping']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Aug;4(8):1029-36.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clones expressing constitutive high levels of L-myc failed to differentiate in response to the chemical inducer N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). The block to differentiation correlated with the level of L-myc expression. Furthermore, transfected clones grown in the presence of inducer for an extended period of time showed an increased level of L-myc expression.

Clones were isolated in vitro in the presence or absence of a source of a hemopoietic growth factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3), and were divisible into three distinct classes. All three classes were leukemogenic in vivo. In vitro, the class I clone grew slowly at low cell density but responded with an increased growth rate to IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and autoconditioned medium. Supernatants of these cultures contained a factor with the biological, biochemical, and antigenic properties of IL-3. Class II clones grew better in vitro at low cell densities than did the class I clone and also responded with an increased growth rate to IL-3, GM-CSF, and autoconditional medium but produced GM-CSF rather than IL-3. In contrast, class III clones died in vitro at all cell densities unless exogenous IL-3 or GM-CSF was added. Moreover, they produced no autostimulatory factors. In the class I and class II clones, one allele of the respective IL-3 or GM-CSF gene is rearranged, and in each case, grossly abnormal RNA transcripts of the rearranged gene are present. Neither rearrangements nor abnormal RNA transcripts of the IL-3 or GM-CSF gene were detected in the class III clones. All three classes exhibited a common rearrangement of the c-myb gene, which suggested that all were derived from the one ancestral cell. These experiments demonstrate that two distinct and independent autostimulatory events were involved in the progression of a single disease.","['Leslie, K B', 'Schrader, J W']","['Leslie KB', 'Schrader JW']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*genetics/physiology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.6.2414-2423.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Jun;9(6):2414-23. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.6.2414-2423.1989.,,['5R01 CA38684-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,PMC362314,,,,,,,,,,,

The NFS/N1.H7 cell line was strictly dependent upon IL-3 for growth, and the cell line could be activated by phorbol esters (PMA) to augment IL-3 dependent proliferation, but when pKC was downregulated, diminished IL-3 proliferative response resulted. Transfection (electroporation) of the T24 RAS-containing vector pAL8 to NFS/N1.H7 led to clones (H7 NeoRas.F3, H7 NeoRas.E2) that had incorporated the entire 6.6 Kb human mutant H-RAS genome. The mutant RAS-containing clones demonstrated greater proliferation than parent cells or cells containing a control (neo-resistance) vector over a range of suboptimal IL-3 does and in optimal IL-3 concentrations had a faster doubling rate than parent cells.

Patients receiving 200 cGy x 6 also received either cyclophosphamide, melphalan, or ara-C and cyclophosphamide. Three patients died of post transplantation complications (interstitial pneumonia, hepatitis B liver necrosis, or encephalitis). This gives a procedure related mortality of 5%. Nonfatal complications were 10 cases of septicemia, 4 interstitial pneumonia, 2 interstitial nephritis, 1 veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and 1 case of hemolytic uremic syndrome. The patient autografted in relapse died of relapse within 2 months. In CR 1 6 or 21 patients have had a relapse, and the actuarial leukemia free survival from CR is 65% (median follow-up 16 months). In CR 2-3 18 of 32 patients have relapsed, and the actuarial leukemia free survival is 31% (median follow-up 18.5 months) from CR. Twelve patients have achieved an inversion, (i.e., present CR longer than previous CR), with a further seven with the potential to achieve inversion.

NEP is identical with the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) of leukemic cells. The expression of NEP on the surface of neutrophils is down-regulated by endocytosis which can be induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 37 degrees C. The activity of the enzyme on the surface of intact cells decreases by 76% within 5 min. The activity can be recovered, however, if the cells are lysed within 5 min of the endocytosis. After 30 min, only 32% of the NEP activity is present in the neutrophil lysates. The loss of activity is presumably due to proteolytic inactivation. Diacylglycerol and monoclonal antibody to CALLA/NEP also induce internalization of NEP. PMA induces endocytosis even at 4 degrees C, but NEP is not inactivated at that temperature. The disappearance of NEP activity after adding PMA was inhibited by various agents. Among the most active were the phospholipase inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide and a combination of the serine protease and cathepsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate and N-ethylmaleimide. The employment of fluorescent monoclonal antibody confirmed the down-regulation and internalization of NEP antigen on the neutrophils. Since NEP inactivates chemotactic peptides and thereby affects chemotaxis of neutrophils (Painter, R. G., Dukes, R., Sullivan, J., Carter, R., Erdos, E. G., and Johnson, A. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9456-9461), the down-regulation of NEP activity on the cell membrane may modulate the function of these cells in inflammation.","['Erdos, E G', 'Wagner, B', 'Harbury, C B', 'Painter, R G', 'Skidgel, R A', 'Fa, X G']","['Erdos EG', 'Wagner B', 'Harbury CB', 'Painter RG', 'Skidgel RA', 'Fa XG']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago 60612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Neprilysin/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*enzymology/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1989/08/25 00:00,1989/08/25 00:01,['1989/08/25 00:00'],"['1989/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)71709-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Aug 25;264(24):14519-23.,,"['AI1263/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36082/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36473/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-mIg antibodies exert either stimulating or inhibitory effects depending on the activation state and/or the differentiation stage of B cells. WEHI-231 is a murine B lymphoma that becomes inactivated upon anti-mIg treatment. This lymphoma has an immature B cell phenotype and is considered as a model for tolerance induction in B lymphocytes. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between mIg triggering, Ca2+ elevation, PKC translocation, and growth inhibition in WEHI-231 cells. Monoclonal antibodies to mu and kappa chains of the mIgM receptor promoted a rapid increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+ and were potent inhibitors of cell growth. Ca2+ elevation and PKC translocation have been previously shown to be associated in B lymphocytes. To study the subcellular distribution of PKC in WEHI-231 cells, we used enzymatic assays and immunodetection methods. Although phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced a rapid and almost complete redistribution of cytosolic PKC to the membrane fraction, anti-mIg treatment failed to modify the compartmentalization of PKC. These findings extend recent observations suggesting that B cell triggering through mIg receptors may involve additional pathways independent from PKC activation. PKC activation in normal B cells is also believed to provide a regulatory signal which limits the magnitude of the early signals produced by anti-mIg. Such a regulatory control is unlikely in WEHI-231 cells, due to the dissociation between Ca2+ mobilization and PKC translocation. Our findings therefore suggest that the sensitivity of immature B cells such as WEHI-231 to the inhibitory effects of anti-mIg antibodies may result in part from alterations of the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway.","['Sarthou, P', 'Henry-Toulme, N', 'Cazenave, P A']","['Sarthou P', 'Henry-Toulme N', 'Cazenave PA']","[""Unite d'Immunochimie Analytique, Departement d'Immunologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin M/*physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830190715 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Jul;19(7):1247-52. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830190715.,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first homogeneous DNA probe assay to be of practical use in the clinical laboratory, and it represents a major simplification of hybridization formats. We also demonstrate the use of this homogeneous assay format to discriminate single-base differences between two closely related target sequences and to detect DNA as well as RNA target molecules. By combining homogeneous hybrid discrimination with solid-phase separation, we have been able to decrease background readings from unhybridized probe to only a few parts per million.

We have done this by the use of highly informative locus-specific hypervariable DNA probes in two sex and blood group matched transplants. In four sex mismatched transplants the Y chromosome was identified by in situ hybridization using a biotinylated Y probe. Early engraftment by day 13 was detected in five of the six patients. Transient chimaerism occurred in half of the cases and was accompanied by the temporary appearance of the Philadelphia chromosome in one patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia without subsequent relapse. Persistence of the graft in the face of falling peripheral counts was documented in four of the six patients studied.

Data were evaluated in relationship to the morphologic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity of NHL at diagnosis and in progressive advanced diseases. Increased sIL-2R levels were found in most cases, when compared with levels observed in healthy controls. No obvious statistical correlation has been observed between sIL-2R values in different NHL subtypes as defined by current classifications. On the other hand, major significance was related to the extent of the disease. Very high values, comparable to those observed in hairy cell leukemia, were observed in a number of large cell NHLs complicating low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferations and in a single case of T-cell Kil+ NHL. The authors' findings suggest that the detection of sIL-2R in NHL may represent a good marker in improving risk assignment of single cases and/or for monitoring remissions and exacerbations during the treatment of cases with very high levels at diagnosis.

At the time of ABMT 12 patients were in CR, 6 in PR and 3 in relapse. 66% of the patients were at high risk at the time of diagnosis. Before ABMT patients received an ablative regimen such as cyclophosphamide or ARA-C, VP-16, DNR and 12 Gy TBI in 6 fractions. In 9 patients the bone marrow was treated in vitro with monoclonal antibodies and complement. The hospital stay was a median 33 (24-57) days and isolation 19 (9-49) days. Complications were septicemia (7), herpes stomatitis (7), infections (6), fungal sepsis (1) and hemorrhagic cystitis (2). Late complications (up to 6 months after ABMT) were pneumococcal sepsis (1), cerebral toxoplasmosis (1) and herpes zoster (3). 10 of 19 evaluable patients are alive and relapse-free 1-33 months (median 10) after ABTM, and 3 of 10 more than 2 years later: 4 of 5 were transplanted in 1.

CR or PR. 5 patients died 1-13 (median 3.5) months on relapse, 2 of 21 from septicemia. The morbidity of ABMT is comparable with conventional high dose chemotherapy. Relapse-free survival was significantly influenced by the remission status at ABMT. Long-term survivors can be expected even in patients with high risk hematological malignancies.

Mutations involving codon 59 were also observed in one case (CML1). In longitudinal studies of 3 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia samples obtained at the time of initial diagnosis and 5 to 7 years later, a multiplicity of mutations were detected at the time of initial diagnosis prior to any therapy. In one case (CML3), a mutation in codon 61 detected at diagnosis was still present 5 years later, in a second case (CML1) a mutation in codon 61 appeared during the course of the disease and persisted for at least one year, and in the third case (CML2) a mutation in codon 61 was present at diagnosis but absent 5 years later.

The present studies examined the cytotoxic effects of an IgA anti-human Tf receptor MAb, 42/6, combined with parabactin, a powerful Fe chelator, or Ga nitrate. Parabactin inhibited in vitro growth of human hematopoietic and solid tumor cells, and the rank order of their sensitivities to the Fe chelator was identical to their relative sensitivity to MAb 42/6 as demonstrated in previous studies. When the most parabactin and MAb 42/6-sensitive (HL60 leukemia) and -resistant (KB carcinoma) cells were incubated with various concentrations of parabactin, cell killing was time and dose dependent over the first 24 hours. Little additional cytotoxicity occurred, however, when cells were exposed to parabactin for 48 hours. HL60 cells were slightly more sensitive than KB cells to parabactin cytotoxicity. Addition of optimally effective concentrations of anti-Tf receptor MAb 42/6 to parabactin increased cytotoxicity to HL60 cells over a narrow parabactin dose range but had little effect on cytotoxicity to KB cells. Cell cycle analysis of cells treated with parabactin for 24 hours showed that doses causing variable cytotoxicity increased the percentage of cells in S phase, but higher parabactin concentrations consistently arrested cells in G1 phase or at the G1/S interface. MAb 42/6 also increased toxicity of parabactin to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors and normal marrow granulocyte/macrophage progenitors. When HL60 or KB cells were treated with MAb 42/6 combined with Ga nitrate, MAb 42/6 increased cytotoxicity of Ga for HL60 cells but had little or no effect on Ga cytotoxicity to KB cells. In contrast, MAb 42/6 had minimal effects on cytotoxicity of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, isoquinaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, to either HL60 or KB cells. Both hematopoietic and solid tumors were killed by Fe depletion, but the present studies suggested that hematopoietic cells are more sensitive than solid tumor cells to cytotoxic effects of Fe depletion. Combined Fe depletion therapy by the use of MAb 42/6 with an Fe chelator or Ga salt increased toxicity to MAb 42/6-sensitive cells, such as HL60, but was not more effective against MAb 42/6-resistant solid tumor cells. Combination Fe depletion therapy of hematopoietic cell tumors merits evaluation in experimental in vivo tumor systems.","['Taetle, R', 'Honeysett, J M', 'Bergeron, R']","['Taetle R', 'Honeysett JM', 'Bergeron R']","['Department of Pathology, University of California Cancer Center, San Diego.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gallium/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/administration & dosage', '*Iron Deficiencies', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxazoles/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/08/16 00:00,1989/08/16 00:01,['1989/08/16 00:00'],"['1989/08/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/16 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/81.16.1229 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1989 Aug 16;81(16):1229-35. doi: 10.1093/jnci/81.16.1229.,,"['CA-23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-34897/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '74149-70-5 (parabactin)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'VRA0C6810N (gallium nitrate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Labeled proteoglycans were purified by anion exchange chromatography and characterized by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with chemical and enzymatic degradation. M1 cells synthesize a single predominant species of proteoglycan which distributes almost equally between the cell and medium after 17 h labeling. The cell-associated proteoglycan has an overall size of about 135 kDa and contains three to five chondroitin sulfate chains (28-31 kDa each) attached to a chondroitinase-generated core protein of 28 kDa. The synthesis and subsequent secretion of this proteoglycan was enhanced 4-5-fold in cells induced to differentiate into macrophages. This was not a phenomenon of arrest in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, since density inhibited undifferentiated cells arrested at this stage did not increase proteoglycan synthesis. The chondroitin sulfate chains contained exclusively chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate; however, the ratio of these two disaccharides differed between the medium- and cell-associated proteoglycans, and changed during progression of the cells into a fully differentiated phenotype. Pulse-chase kinetics indicate the presence of two distinct pools of proteoglycan; one that is secreted very rapidly from the cell after a approximately 1-h lag, and a second pool that is turned over in the cell with a half-time of approximately 3.5 h. Subtle differences in the glycosylation patterns of the medium- and cell-associated species are consistent with synthesis of two pools. Papain digestion suggests that the chondroitin sulfate chains are clustered on a small protease resistant peptide. The data suggest that this proteoglycan is similar to the serglycin proteoglycan family.","['McQuillan, D J', 'Yanagishita, M', 'Hascall, V C', 'Bickel, M']","['McQuillan DJ', 'Yanagishita M', 'Hascall VC', 'Bickel M']","['Bone Research Branch, National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Proteoglycans/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism/pathology']",1989/08/05 00:00,1989/08/05 00:01,['1989/08/05 00:00'],"['1989/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)51621-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Aug 5;264(22):13245-51.,,,"['0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The type of transplants to be focused on were allogeneic T-lymphocyte deplete. Total body irradiation (TBI) was initially patterned after the Memorial method. Patients received total body irradiation in a sitting position at a dose rate of 20-25 cGy/minute with 50% attenuation lung blocks used both anterior/posterior and posterior/anterior. Electron boosting was utilized for the ribs beneath the lung blocks. Occasionally, lower extremity boosting was required because of the sitting position. A dose of 14 Gy was chosen since T-lymphocyte deplete bone marrow transplant data suggest the need for higher total doses to consistently obtain engraftment. This dose was given in 3 equal daily fractions over 3 days following conditioning chemotherapy. Six of 11 patients treated in this manner developed lethal pulmonary events. In response to the pulmonary toxicity, partial lung shielding was increased to 60% attenuation. In the next 107 patients receiving this program of total body irradiation there was a reduced incidence of fatal pulmonary events (10 cases of fatal idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis and 12 cases of fatal pulmonary infections) after a median follow-up of 9 months. This was an obvious improvement over the initial group. A significant level of hepato-renal toxicity was also observed with 14 Gy total body irradiation when no liver or kidney blocking was used. Of the first 20 patients treated, three cases of fatal veno-occlusive disease resulted. Subsequently, a 10% attenuation right sided liver block was added. Five of 98 patients treated with this block have developed fatal hepatic dysfunction, (median follow-up of 7.2 months). This incidence is not statistically different from the initial group but favors the use of the liver block. Some renal toxicity was also detected with the earlier regimen, especially in pediatric patients. Partial kidney blocking has been implemented to minimize this toxicity. Our current dose rate has been reduced to 8 cGy/minute in a further attempt to reduce organ toxicity. To date, this selective blocking has not adversely affected the excellent rate (96%) of first time engraftments.","['Lawton, C A', 'Barber-Derus, S', 'Murray, K J', 'Casper, J T', 'Ash, R C', 'Gillin, M T', 'Wilson, J F']","['Lawton CA', 'Barber-Derus S', 'Murray KJ', 'Casper JT', 'Ash RC', 'Gillin MT', 'Wilson JF']","['Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, Department of Radiation Oncology, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/etiology', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects/*methods']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(89)90446-X [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(89)90446-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Aug;17(2):319-22. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(89)90446-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical and laboratory features of ITP are quite uniform and facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis. Bone marrow examination is not required in most cases since patients with alternative diagnoses (such as ALL) have greatly different presenting features. Acute ITP cannot be differentiated from the chronic form of the disease at presentation, nor can chronic disease be prevented by specific therapy administered for apparent acute ITP. Much controversy has revolved around whether an active interventionist (pharmacologic) or non-interventionist approach is preferred for management of ITP. The platelet count in both acute and chronic ITP often rises following treatment with prednisone and/or intravenous gamma globulin (IV GG), but such responses are transient and do not clearly provide protection against the rare complication of life-threatening hemorrhage. There are numerous disadvantages to an interventionist approach to therapy. Children with chronic ITP may require splenectomy if the disease is symptomatic enough to interfere with life-style, but the majority of these patients, too, require no specific therapy.","['Buchanan, G R']",['Buchanan GR'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320257 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1989 Jul;59(1):96-104. doi: 10.1007/BF00320257.,31,,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In first-remission adults, non-T-cell phenotype, male to female donor-recipient sex-match and graft-v-host disease (GVHD) were associated with decreased leukemia-free survival; inclusion of corticosteroids in the regimen to prevent GVHD was associated with increased leukemia-free survival. Variables associated with decreased leukemia-free survival after second-remission transplants were age greater than or equal to 16 years and relapse occurring while on therapy. Variables associated with increased probability of relapse were similar for first- and second-remission transplants and included GVHD prophylaxis without methotrexate and absence of GVHD. In first-remission transplants, leukocyte count greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis was also associated with increased relapse; in second remission, relapse while receiving chemotherapy was also associated with increased posttransplant relapse. These data emphasize the importance of both disease- and transplant-related variables in predicting outcome after BMT. They may be used to explain differences between studies, design future trials, and identify persons most likely to benefit from BMT.","['Barrett, A J', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Gale, R P', 'Biggs, J C', 'Camitta, B M', 'Dicke, K A', 'Gluckman, E', 'Good, R A', 'Herzig, R H', 'Lee, M B']","['Barrett AJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gale RP', 'Biggs JC', 'Camitta BM', 'Dicke KA', 'Gluckman E', 'Good RA', 'Herzig RH', 'Lee MB', 'et al.']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85385-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):862-71.,,"['CA 40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-62530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1 stimulated tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake of AML cells in 13 of 28 cases. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the leukemic clonality of the IL-1-stimulated cells. Most likely, IL-1 exerted these stimulative effects directly on AML blast cells because IL-1 effectively induced 3H-TdR uptake of CD34-positive AML blasts (separated following cell sorting). Furthermore, adherent cell-depleted AML samples of three patients were more effectively stimulated than nondepleted AML fractions. Cluster and colony formation from adherent cell depleted AML samples could also be stimulated with IL-1, ie, in seven of ten cases analyzed. Subsequent experiments indicated that IL-1 stimulation depended on the release of GM-CSF because (1) induction of DNA synthesis of AML cells by IL-1 could be abrogated with antigranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody, (2) conditioned media (CM) prepared from IL-1 stimulated AML blasts (adherent cell depleted) could stimulate the proliferation of purified normal bone marrow progenitors whereas supernatants from nonstimulated AML blasts did not, and (3) GM-CSF was demonstrated in IL-1/AML-CM with a specific radioimmunoassay, while GM-CSF was not detectable in nonstimulated supernatants. In one case of AML showing significant 3H-TdR uptake in the absence of CSFs, this spontaneous DNA synthesis was found to depend on autocrine IL-1 beta release as it could be suppressed with anti-IL-1 beta antibody or anti-GM-CSF. The blockade by anti-IL-1 beta could be overcome by the addition of high concentrations of IL-1 beta as well as GM-CSF. Thus, in this particular case, endogenously produced IL-1 beta had stimulated the release of GM-CSF which resulted in GM-CSF-dependent proliferation. The results indicate that GM-CSF production by AML blasts is often regulated by IL-1 rather than being constitutive.","['Delwel, R', 'van Buitenen, C', 'Salem, M', 'Bot, F', 'Gillis, S', 'Kaushansky, K', 'Altrock, B', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Delwel R', 'van Buitenen C', 'Salem M', 'Bot F', 'Gillis S', 'Kaushansky K', 'Altrock B', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85346-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):586-93.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, can induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of leukemia cells, but concentrations required to achieve these effects cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. Seven new analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 were discovered to be either equivalent or more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 as assessed by: (a) inhibition of clonal proliferation of HL-60, EM-2, U937, and patients' myeloid leukemic cells: and (b) induction of differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytes. Furthermore, these analogs stimulated clonal growth of normal human myeloid stem cells. The most potent analog, 1,25-dihydroxy-16ene-23yne-vitamin D3, was about fourfold more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3. This analog decreased clonal growth and expression of c-myc oncogene in HL-60 cells by 50% within ten hours of exposure. Effects on calcium metabolism of these novel analogs in vivo was assessed by intestinal calcium absorption (ICA) and bone calcium mobilization (BCM). Each of the analogs mediated markedly less (10 to 200-fold) ICA and BCM as compared with 1,25(OH)2D3. To gain insight into the possible mechanism of action of these new analogs, receptor binding studies were done with 1,25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-D3 and showed that it competed only about 60% as effectively as 1,25(OH)2D3 for 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors present in HL-60 cells and 98% as effective as 1,25(OH)2D3 for receptors present in chick intestinal cells. In summary, we have discovered seven novel vitamin D analogs that are more potent than the physiologic 1,25(OH)2D3 as measured by a variety of hematopoietic assays. In contrast, these compounds appear to have the potential to be markedly less toxic (induction of hypercalcemia). These novel vitamin D compounds may be superior to 1,25(OH)2D3 in a number of clinical situations including leukemia/preleukemia; they will provide a tool to dissect the mechanism of action of vitamin D seco-steroids in promoting cellular differentiation.","['Zhou, J Y', 'Norman, A W', 'Lubbert, M', 'Collins, E D', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Zhou JY', 'Norman AW', 'Lubbert M', 'Collins ED', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chickens', 'Clone Cells', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77324-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):82-93.,,"['CA 26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously found that the myeloid progenitor cell (CFU-GM) content of the marrow grafts after ex vivo purging with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) correlates with time to hematologic recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. We observed that variable red blood cell concentration of the bone marrow incubation mixture results in differential cytotoxic activity of 4-HC. The CFU-GM content of the graft after the ex vivo treatment is a measure of this 4-HC activity. We analyzed the disease-free survival of 45 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation with 4-HC purged grafts. Patients who relapsed after transplantation had 4.2 +/- 1.1% of graft CFU-GM surviving the ex vivo purge, compared with 1.1 +/- 0.4% for patients who achieved a sustained remission (P = .06). Twenty-three patients with a CFU-GM content after 4-HC purging of greater than 1% of the pretreatment value had an actuarial disease-free survival of 12%, compared to 36% for 22 patients with a less than or equal to 1% CFU-GM content after purging (P = .006). Therefore, percent CFU-GM survival as a measure of 4-HC cytotoxicity identified a group of patients with insufficient purging. Although no randomized clinical trials have documented the need for ex vivo purging, our results suggest that effective bone marrow purging is important for the optimal application of autologous transplantation in the treatment of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.","['Rowley, S D', 'Jones, R J', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Braine, H G', 'Colvin, O M', 'Davis, J', 'Saral, R', 'Sharkis, S', 'Wingard, J', 'Yeager, A M']","['Rowley SD', 'Jones RJ', 'Piantadosi S', 'Braine HG', 'Colvin OM', 'Davis J', 'Saral R', 'Sharkis S', 'Wingard J', 'Yeager AM', 'et al.']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77383-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):501-6.,,"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this cell line, we studied the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic cells in the presence of highly purified human hematopoietic factors and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). In a methylcellulose culture system, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) facilitated colony formation by CMK cells in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum stimulating doses of these factors were 10 and 200 U/mL, respectively. These concentrations were comparable to those that stimulate activity in normal hematopoietic cells. In contrast, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), and erythropoietin (EPO) had no effects on the colony formation of CMK cells. In a liquid culture system, 20% of the CMK cells expressed glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antigen without hematopoietic factors, whereas 40% of the cells expressed GPIIb/IIIa with the addition of IL-3 and GM-CSF. EPO also slightly enhanced expression of GPIIb/IIIa. On the other hand, PMA inhibited growth of CMK cells and induced most of them to express the GPIIb/IIIa antigen. Furthermore, PMA induced CMK cells to produce growth activity toward new inocula of CMK cells. This growth factor (GF) contained colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in normal bone marrow (BM) cells. The activity was believed to be attributable mainly to GM-CSF, since 64% of this activity was neutralized by anti-GM-CSF antibodies and a transcript of GM-CSF was detected in mRNA from PMA-treated CMK cells by Northern blot analysis. These observations suggest that GM-CSF, as well as IL-3, should play an important role in megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Komatsu, N', 'Suda, T', 'Moroi, M', 'Tokuyama, N', 'Sakata, Y', 'Okada, M', 'Nishida, T', 'Hirai, Y', 'Sato, T', 'Fuse, A']","['Komatsu N', 'Suda T', 'Moroi M', 'Tokuyama N', 'Sakata Y', 'Okada M', 'Nishida T', 'Hirai Y', 'Sato T', 'Fuse A', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine and Biochemistry II, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/genetics/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77319-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):42-8.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were prepared for BMT with high-dose cyclophosphamide followed by 7.5 Gy single-dose irradiation; AA patients received total lymphoid irradiation (TLI), and leukemia patients received total body irradiation (TBI). AA patients demonstrated reduced height posttransplant as reflected in a negative mean standard deviation score. The observed reduction was statistically significant only at 3 years following transplant. In contrast, leukemia patients showed a significant loss in relative height that was first visible at 1 year post-BMT and continued until at least 4 years post-BMT.

Furthermore, the influence of initial patient and disease characteristics on the outcome was analyzed. Between May 1979 and December 1982, 240 patients entered the study and were randomized into two groups: group A (n = 122) received induction treatment with vincristine (VCR), prednisone (Pred), and L-asparaginase (L-Asp); for group B (n = 118), induction therapy consisted of VCR, Pred, L-Asp, and rubidomycin (Rub). All patients subsequently underwent cranial irradiation (doses adjusted to age) in combination with intrathecal methotrexate; maintenance therapy of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate for 5 weeks followed by vincristine and prednisone for 2 weeks was given for 24 months.

The diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia is usually based on the morphology of blood/bone marrow aspirate smears and bone marrow sections. We report three cases of hairy cell leukemia that had an unusual multilobated nuclear appearance seen on both smears and tissue sections. Many of the hairy cells exhibited marked nuclear lobulations and convolutions, giving rise to clover leaf-like nuclear configurations. The nuclear chromatin was finely reticular and characteristic of hairy cell leukemia. Bone marrow sections were hypercellular and the leukemic infiltrate was loosely distributed. A leukemic infiltrate was also seen in splenic sections in two cases in which splenectomy was carried out. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase cytochemistry was positive in all three cases. Flow cytometric analysis and paraffin section immunoperoxidase studies confirmed the B-cell lineage of the leukemic cells in all cases. The multilobulated nuclei described in these three cases are quite unusual in hairy cell leukemia; they could potentially lead to an erroneous diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Features typical of hairy cell leukemia, such as the nuclear chromatin distribution and pattern of bone marrow infiltration, together with the clinical history, are helpful in establishing a correct diagnosis of these variant cases of hairy cell leukemia.","['Hanson, C A', 'Ward, P C', 'Schnitzer, B']","['Hanson CA', 'Ward PC', 'Schnitzer B']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0602.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Chromatin/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-198908000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1989 Aug;13(8):671-9. doi: 10.1097/00000478-198908000-00005.,,,['0 (Chromatin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively reviewed 186 consecutive patients undergoing BMT from 1976 to 1986 to determine incidence and type of liver disease after BMT and predisposing factors. Two of 186 patients experienced VOD (1.07%). Acute and chronic liver GVHD were found in 25.8% and 36% of the patients, respectively. Acute hepatitis (AH) was diagnosed in 29.4% and chronic hepatitis (CH) in 42.6% of the patients. Statistical analysis showed no influence of pretransplant variables on the occurrence of acute GVHD and AH; there was a weak correlation (P = 0.01) between pre-BMT abnormal transaminases and occurrence of chronic GVHD. Contingency table and Cox analysis showed a greater risk of CH for patients with abnormal pretransplant SGPT levels (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0022). No other variables could be associated with posttransplant CH. Actuarial survival was 71% versus 69% for patients with normal versus abnormal transaminases (P = 0.2). As VOD was a rare event, despite 53% of patients having abnormal transaminase values before transplant, we suggest that a lower and slower TBI is more important than pretransplant normal transaminases in preventing this complication.

We isolated from this library a 1.6-kilobase full-length clone designated b4 whose corresponding mRNA was greatly increased in abundance in cytoplasmic RNA under these conditions. Dideoxy sequencing revealed that this mRNA encoded MONAP (monocyte-derived neutrophil-activating peptide), a 10-kilodalton monokine with neutrophil-specific chemotactic and enzyme-releasing activities. The 3' untranslated region of this mRNA was found to be 1.2 kilobases long and possessed nine copies of the AUUUA sequence known to be associated with regulation of mRNA stability. Actinomycin D chase experiments yielded evidence that cytoplasmic stabilization was one of the means of regulation of MONAP expression. Analysis of cytoplasmic poly(A)- RNA revealed the presence of several discrete truncated species that shared a common 5' end and appeared to be intermediates of degradation. S1 mapping showed that the 3' ends of these molecules were distributed throughout the 3' untranslated region, preferentially in A + U-rich regions, broadly correlating with the distribution of AUUUA sites. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that transcriptional induction accounted for less than 15% of the accumulation of MONAP mRNA. This mRNA was induced in HL60 cells by treatment with several differentiation-inducing agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-myristate alone, sodium butyrate, vitamin D3, and dimethyl sulfoxide. It was also induced in quiescent diploid lung fibroblasts stimulated to divide by serum, and it was constitutively overexpressed by some human tumor lines.","['Kowalski, J', 'Denhardt, D T']","['Kowalski J', 'Denhardt DT']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemotactic Factors/*genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.5.1946-1957.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 May;9(5):1946-57. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.5.1946-1957.1989.,,,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,PMC362986,,['GENBANK/M26383'],,,,,,,,,

Despite this, little is known regarding patients' and physicians' perceptions of the process in which informed consent for this controversial and potentially lethal procedure is obtained. Thirty-nine adult BMT patients and the parents of 61 children undergoing BMT and each of their physicians completed a questionnaire concerning their perceptions of the discussion in which consent for BMT was obtained and their evaluation of the consent document. In addition, the factors influencing patients' and parents' decision to accept BMT and the nature and amount of BMT information retained by patients and parents were assessed.

The initial response rate to this type of therapy is high in patients with a variety of cancers but the survival rate is affected in only a few patients, mainly in women with choriocarcinoma. Despite intensive research, the percentage of survivors following chemotherapy, for example in patients with small-cell bronchogenic cancer, has remained almost constant during the last 2 decades. The objective of the present paper is to consider the likelihood of immune mechanisms being active both in the regression and again in the later progression of tumor growth observed during treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Such a dual role for immunity appears to be possible. In contrast to most malignant cells in solid tumors, the leucocytes and leukemia cells are highly sensitive to anti-cancer agents. Thereby the drugs become immunosuppressive at a level in serum lower than that required for a direct interference with the proliferative capacity of the cells in a solid tumor. Furthermore, the cytotoxic drugs selectively influence the immune system. In the first phase of treatment the drugs enhance the effect of T-killer cells relatively by reducing blocking activity in serum; the net result being a regression in the tumor volume. However, continued chemotherapy is inconvenient for cancer patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Laursen, M L']",['Laursen ML'],"['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-9877(89)90159-X [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(89)90159-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1989 May;29(1):9-15. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(89)90159-x.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the responses of AML blasts to TNF-alpha in the presence of defined growth factors (recombinant granulocyte/macrophage-CSF [rGM-CSF], recombinant granulocyte-CSF [rG-CSF], rIL-3, and rIL-1) and under conditions described for autocrine stimulation (32). While TNF-alpha antagonized the stimulatory effects of G-CSF and IL-3 on blast progenitors, TNF-alpha did not affect blast colony formation in the presence of IL-1. Unexpectedly, TNF-alpha significantly enhanced blast proliferation in the presence of GM-CSF. Further, TNF-alpha also acted synergistically with an endogenous source of growth stimulatory signal to promote proliferation of blast clonogenic cells. Thus, on human leukemic cells, TNF-alpha appears to be a molecule that is at least bifunctional, having the ability to either support or inhibit cell proliferation, depending on the other growth factors present. It is postulated that the proliferative response of blast progenitors to TNF-alpha under conditions that favor autocrine stimulation may represent one property that allows the cells to escape from negative regulation and proliferate in AML.","['Hoang, T', 'Levy, B', 'Onetto, N', 'Haman, A', 'Rodriguez-Cimadevilla, J C']","['Hoang T', 'Levy B', 'Onetto N', 'Haman A', 'Rodriguez-Cimadevilla JC']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.170.1.15 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Jul 1;170(1):15-26. doi: 10.1084/jem.170.1.15.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,PMC2189388,,,,,,,,,,,

There is much to learn however about the mechanisms of CSF action, and also much to learn about the role these factors play in hematopoietic regulation in vivo. The role, if any, of marrow stromal cells in the production of CSFs is particularly important and needs much clearer definition. Much of our understanding of CSF activity has been previously dependent on in vitro bioassays which were sensitive but frequently imprecise. The availability of purified recombinant protein has alleviated the reliance on conditioned media. Previously used conditioned media frequently contained multiple growth factors and inhibitory factors. The cloning of the CSFs has revealed both structural homology and diversity. The conserved genomic structural schema between the majority of the CSFs suggest a common ancestral gene. However, M-CSF diverges from this schema. Conserved also is the 3' untranslated motif of AUUUA in the majority of CSFs. M-CSF is again divergent in this respect. However, where regulation of the mRNA transcript level has been characterized carefully, normal cells appear to regulate CSF mRNAs primarily in a post transcriptional manner. The regulation of CSF transcription in leukemia is complex. In retrovirally mediated leukemia, CSF production is due to increased transcription mediated by the retrovirus. In the few cases of human leukemias making CSFs which have been studied, evidence for both post-transcriptional regulation and structural rearrangements in the CSF genes has been presented. Due to the extreme rarity of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells that correspond to the same state of differentiation as that of the leukemic blast forms, several questions remain. Do normal progenitor cells also make CSFs at some stages of differentiation? What role, if any, do CSFs play in leukemogenesis? The rapid development of our understanding of CSFs over the past several years has led to a much better understanding of hematopoiesis. As we understand more of normal hematopoiesis we also begin to understand the complexities involved in the abnormal regulation as in myelogenous leukemias. With the powerful tools currently available we can be much more precise in our understanding of the intricacies involved.","['Ernst, T J', 'Griffin, J D']","['Ernst TJ', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,IM,"['Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02918145 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 1989;8(3):202-14. doi: 10.1007/BF02918145.,57,"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transfected cells, structural proteins of HTLV-I, the gag and env products, were formed and processed in the same manner as observed in MT-2 cells. The nucleotide sequence was determined for a region between the gag and pol genes of the proviral DNA clone containing an open-reading frame. The deduced amino acid sequences show that this open-reading frame encodes a putative HTLV-I protease. The protease gene (pro) of HTLV-I was investigated using a vaccinia virus expression vector. Processing of 53k gag precursor polyprotein into mature p19, p24, and p15 gag structural proteins was detectable with a recombinant plasmid harboring the entire gag- and protease-coding sequence. We demonstrated that the protease processed the gag precursor polyprotein in a trans-action. A change in the sequence Asp(64)-Thr-Gly, the catalytic core sequence among aspartyl proteases, to Gly-Thr-Gly was shown to abolish correct processing, suggesting that HTLV-I protease may belong to the aspartyl protease group. The 76k gag-pro precursor polyprotein was identified, implying that a cis-acting function of HTLV-I protease may be necessary to trigger the initial cleavage event for its own release from a precursor protein, followed by the release of p53 gag precursor protein. The p53 gag precursor protein is then processed by the trans-action of the released protease to form p19, p24, and p15.","['Hatanaka, M', 'Nam, S H']","['Hatanaka M', 'Nam SH']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Endopeptidases/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HIV Protease', 'Hydrolysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240400103 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1989 May;40(1):15-30. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240400103.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythropoietin (EPO) also sustained the short-term growth of TF-1, but did not induce erythroid differentiation. These three hematopoietic growth factors acted on TF-1 synergistically. Transforming growth factor-beta and interferons inhibited the factor-dependent growth of TF-1 cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and monocyte-colony stimulating factor and interkeukin-1 enhanced the GM-CSF-dependent growth of TF-1. Ultrastructural studies revealed some very immature features in this cell line. Although TF-1 cells do not express glycophorin A or carbonyl anhydrase I, the morphological and cytochemical features, and the constitutive expression of globin genes, indicate the commitment of TF-1 to erythroid lineage. When induced to differentiate, TF-1 entered two different pathways. Specifically, hemin and delta-aminolevulinic acid induced hemoglobin synthesis, whereas TPA induced dramatic differentiation of TF-1 into macrophage-like cells. In summary, TF-1 is a cell line of immature erythroid origin that requires GM-CSF, IL-3, or EPO for its growth and that has the ability to undergo differentiation into either more mature erythroid cells or into macrophage-like cells. TF-1 is a useful tool for analyzing the human receptors for IL-3, GM-CSF, and EPO or the signal transduction of these hemopoietic growth factors.","['Kitamura, T', 'Tange, T', 'Terasawa, T', 'Chiba, S', 'Kuwaki, T', 'Miyagawa, K', 'Piao, Y F', 'Miyazono, K', 'Urabe, A', 'Takaku, F']","['Kitamura T', 'Tange T', 'Terasawa T', 'Chiba S', 'Kuwaki T', 'Miyagawa K', 'Piao YF', 'Miyazono K', 'Urabe A', 'Takaku F']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/analysis/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Mitosis', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis/pathology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041400219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1989 Aug;140(2):323-34. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041400219.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characteristic chromosomal translocations found in various histological types of leukemia and lymphoma can also be detected by Southern blot or by polymerase chain-reaction-based techniques. Detection of point mutations in the ras family of oncogenes may have prognostic importance and permit detection of a monoclonal population in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemias.

A comparison of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.,75-92,"Adjuvant chemotherapy. The frequent 6 month complete remission induction chemotherapy is not discussed here. What is under debate at present is the prolonged maintenance or adjuvant chemotherapy, which in comparative trials with 5 year follow-up does not appear to improve survival prognosis in leukemia, myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or post-menopausal breast cancer. However, it may prolong the duration of the first remission. It is suggested that the sensitivity to chemotherapy might depend on cells being induced into the G2 or M phases by growth growth promotor(s), such as estrogens in breast carcinoma. Their presence before the menopause could explain why this neoplasia in this condition is one of the few tumoral diseases transitorily sensitive to adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant immunotherapy is also under debate. Immunotherapy has been reported to give a significant improvement in remission duration and/or overall survival and/or survival after relapse in several tumors and in several trials. However, for almost every trial reporting a statistically significant effect there is one (or more) which shows no significant effect. Theoretically, immunotherapy has several advantages over chemotherapy. It may be effective in minimal residual disease if tumor cells are in the G0 phase. So-called kinetic refractoriness (see separate chapter in this volume) may not apply to immunotherapy. Finally, tumor cells appear to be more sensitive than normal cells to some cytotoxic mechanisms which form a part of the biological response to tumors.","['Mathe, G', 'Reizenstein, P', 'Eriguchi, M']","['Mathe G', 'Reizenstein P', 'Eriguchi M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Duplicate Publication', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Luxembourg,Bull Soc Sci Med Grand Duche Luxemb,Bulletin de la Societe des sciences medicales du Grand-Duche de Luxembourg,7503402,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Sci Med Grand Duche Luxemb. 1989 Mar-Apr;126(1):75-92.,193,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, preliminary results of our study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are reported. Although there have been very few specific reports on this topic, it was possible to find some data, suggesting a worse prognosis for patients with MPN. Several factors may be responsible for this, and further studies are in progress. Meanwhile, it is of great importance to decrease the incidence of cancer by prevention, such as reducing smoking and alcohol consumption. This may reduce the incidence of first primary neoplasms and MPN. Optimal treatment for the first primary neoplasm should be given, but the possible risk of MPN should be taken into consideration, and, if there are two alternatives for the treatment of the first tumor, the one that is less carcinogenic and that will allow appropriate therapy for a second primary neoplasm (MPN2) should be chosen. On follow-up of cancer patients, a low threshold of suspicion for a second primary neoplasm is recommended to detect them early for possible curative treatment.

HL-60 cells and phorbol diester-resistant HL-60-1E3 cells exposed to conditioned medium from Reh cells mature along the monocyte/macrophage pathway, as assessed by several assays (express nonspecific esterase, produce superoxide anion, morphologically resemble monocytes, mediate phorbol diester-triggered extracellular cytolytic activity). Reh cell conditioned medium is antiproliferative toward a panel of cell lines, is not nonspecifically cytotoxic, has no antiviral or colony-stimulating factor activities, and is not affected by exposure to insolubilized anti-gamma interferon. A 48-kDa glycoprotein (P48) which mediates this differentiation factor activity has been purified to homogeneity from Reh cell conditioned medium, and a polyclonal neutralizing antiserum has been produced. P48 activity is not blocked by either anti-TNF-alpha and anti-TNF-beta and on Western blot analysis is antigenically distinct from TNF-alpha and TNF-beta. In addition, polyclonal anti-P48 does not block either TNF-alpha or TNF-beta activities or recognize either on Western blots. Unlike gamma interferon, colony-stimulating factor, TNF-alpha, or TNF-beta, P48 reverses phorbol diester resistance of HL-60-1E3 cells. These studies present strong evidence for the existence of a previously unrecognized cytokine which, unlike other reported differentiation factors, is antigenically unrelated to TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

With the exception of leukemia, nine of the leading cancers in humans may be associated positively or negatively with diet. Extensive literature reviewed by an expert group convened by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the strongest evidence of an association between the incidence of certain cancers and dietary components is that for dietary fat, particularly for breast cancer (Committee on Diet, Nutrition and Cancer, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences; Diet, Nutrition and Cancer; Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1982). The conclusions reached by this group and the consensus of other advisory experts provided the rationale for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to sponsor a multi-institutional breast cancer prevention trial. This trial was designed to test whether a diet containing 20% of calories from fat compared with the usual diet containing twice that amount would reduce breast cancer incidence in 45- to 69-year-old women. Ensuing controversies about the nature of the research evidence and methodologic issues related to the conduct of this trial led NCI, on advice of its counselors, to discontinue the full-scale implementation. It is clear from these debates that experts have looked at the same data and differed both in their interpretation and in their conception of what constitutes convincing evidence.","['Greenwald, P']",['Greenwald P'],"['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-3100.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Prev Med,Preventive medicine,0322116,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dietary Fats/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Research Design']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0091-7435(89)90063-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0091-7435(89)90063-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Med. 1989 Mar;18(2):163-6. doi: 10.1016/0091-7435(89)90063-7.,16,,['0 (Dietary Fats)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The timing of occurrence and the frequency of GHD were related to the hypothalamic-pituitary radiation dose. Frequency varied from 50% in leukemia (2400 cGy) to 75% in face and neck tumors or medulloblastoma (2500-4500 cGy) and up to 100% in optic glioma (greater than 4500 cGy). The significantly more severe growth deficit in patients with GHD given higher radiation doses suggests different levels of residual GH secretion according to radiation dosage. The minimum harmful radiation dose is probably close to 1800-2000 cGy. Our data show that stimulation tests remain a useful means of defining GHD and predicting growth. A fair agreement between GH secretion and growth was found in most cases, regardless of the radiation dose. The only exception was a group of leukemic children (2400 cGy) who achieved normal prepubertal growth despite a low GH response. The 24-h spontaneous plasma GH profiles and IGF-I measurements may add information if growth is retarded despite a normal GH response. We showed that growth retardation occurring after some schedules of total body irradiation was not due to GH deficiency but rather to radiation-induced skeletal lesions. Early or true precocious puberty, generally associated with GHD, was another cause of height loss. As the role of GH deficiency in the final height reduction was demonstrated in all groups of patients after cranial radiation, we suggest that hGH therapy should be considered in any child with proven GH deficiency and significant growth retardation after such radiation.","['Rappaport, R', 'Brauner, R']","['Rappaport R', 'Brauner R']","['Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, Hopital des Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Puberty/radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Skull/radiation effects']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-198906000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1989 Jun;25(6):561-7. doi: 10.1203/00006450-198906000-00001.,77,,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of these antiretroviral agents were synthesized more than twenty years ago as analogues of physiologically important deoxynucleosides in the quest of a more effective cancer chemotherapy. None of the synthetic analogues manifested significant activity when screened against L1210 leukemia in BDF mice despite the fact that the phosphorylation reactions, crucial to the activation of the 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, are catalyzed by kinases of appropriate target cells. However, the 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates, relative to corresponding deoxynucleotides, have a reduced affinity for DNA polymerase alpha, an enzyme that has key DNA synthetic and repair functions in the life of a cell.

Distinctive pathologic findings were found most often in the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The bone marrow biopsies contained nonparatrabecular lymphoid infiltrates that were nodular or diffuse and interstitial. Plasmacytosis was found and in two cases there was myeloid maturation arrest. The liver biopsies contained sinusoidal and portal infiltrates and the spleen had red pulp cord and sinus infiltrates, plasmacytosis, and follicular hyperplasia. Lymph node involvement was nondiagnostic, consistent with the usual absence of lymphadenopathy. The morphologic findings were sometimes indistinguishable from other reactive or low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders, especially chronic lymphocytic leukemia/well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/WDLL) and hairy cell leukemia. These results suggest the need to correlate peripheral blood cell counts and morphology as well as immunophenotypic studies with tissue histology to distinguish LGL leukemia from other disorders. Establishing a correct diagnosis of LGL leukemia may help clarify the etiology of unexplained peripheral blood cytopenias, arthritis, and other autoimmune manifestations in individual patients.","['Agnarsson, B A', 'Loughran, T P Jr', 'Starkebaum, G', 'Kadin, M E']","['Agnarsson BA', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Starkebaum G', 'Kadin ME']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/pathology']",1989/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0046-8177(89)90151-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(89)90151-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1989 Jul;20(7):643-51. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(89)90151-2.,,['CA 18821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Hum Pathol. 1990 Apr;21(4):458-9.

Study of 80 cases].,343-52,"The diagnostic value of immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies was assessed in 100 liver biopsy specimens. The majority of these cases were hepatic localizations of lymphoid malignancies. Ten normal and reactive inflammatory liver biopsies were used as controls. Some monoclonal antibodies directed against leukocyte antigens revealed unexpected reactivities with normal liver structures: biliary tract (anti-CD10, anti-B MB2) and hepatocytes (anti-B LN1). In 12/17 cases of hepatic involvement by large cell malignancy, immunohistochemistry allowed the diagnosis of non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); the remaining 5 cases were metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma. It was difficult to differentiate small cell liver NHL from reactive inflammatory infiltration. New anti-B (MB1, MB2, 4KB5, LN1 and LN2) and anti-T (MT1 and UCHL1) monoclonal antibodies suitable for use on paraffin sections were of value to phenotype NHL when only fixed material was available. But, information was too limited to distinguish malignant from reactive infiltrates. Immunohistochemistry on frozen sections was often necessary to diagnose inflammatory infiltrates and to phenotype NHL. Most NHL were of B cell origin (11/13 cases) and showed monotypic surface immunoglobulins as well as B cell-associated antigens (CD22+). The expression of the T CD5 antigen by B-cell NHL may have some diagnostic value. When monotypic surface immunoglobulins could not be demonstrated (due to background staining) the expression of this antigen by B lymphocytes was considered to be highly indicative of their neoplastic nature. Hairy cell leukemia exhibited a pathognomonic phenotype on frozen sections (CD11c+, CD22+, CD25+). T NHL were rare (2 cases) and difficult to diagnose due to the lack of clonal markers. The diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease in liver (15/20 cases) was facilitated by using paraffin sections of both monoclonal antibodies anti-CD15 (Leu M1) and anti-CD30 (Ber-H2) which detect fixation-resistant antigens expressed by Sternberg cells.","['Voigt, J J', 'Vinel, J P', 'Caveriviere, P', 'Pradere, B', 'Chittal, S', 'al Saati, T', 'Cales, P', 'Delsol, G']","['Voigt JJ', 'Vinel JP', 'Caveriviere P', 'Pradere B', 'Chittal S', 'al Saati T', 'Cales P', 'Delsol G']","[""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, CHU Purpan, Toulouse.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Gastroenterol Clin Biol,Gastroenterologie clinique et biologique,7704825,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Freezing', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology/secondary', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gastroenterol Clin Biol. 1989 Apr;13(4):343-52.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",Diagnostic immunohistochimique des localisations hepatiques des hemopathies lymphoides malignes.

Although the mechanisms responsible for the cancer-promoting activity of such diets have not been identified, they have been observed to cause impaired immune response, alterations in methylation of liver RNA and DNA, and enhanced susceptibility to oxidative damage. Since alterations in gene expression may also play a critical role, the present studies examined the expression of the c-myc, c-H-ras, epidermal growth factor receptor, and ornithine decarboxylase genes, as well as endogenous retrovirus-like sequences, in C57BL/6J x C3H/HeJ F1 mouse liver during the first 2 weeks of feeding of a methyl-deficient diet. The kinetics of liver cell proliferation was investigated in parallel. Increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into liver DNA was found at day 4 and reached a maximum at days 7-11 after commencement of the methyl-deficient diet, when compared to age-matched mice fed a complete diet. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated liver RNA samples indicated an increase in the levels of RNA homologous to Moloney murine leukemia virus and intracisternal A particle sequences but no significant change in the level of VL30 retrovirus-related RNA in the samples from mice fed methyl-deficient diets. A marked increase in the levels of c-myc and a slight increase in the levels of ornithine decarboxylase and c-H-ras transcripts were seen in the liver RNA samples from the treated mice. Of particular interest was a decrease in the abundance of epidermal growth factor receptor transcripts in the liver RNA samples from the treated mice. These changes in cellular levels of specific RNA resemble, in several respects, those we have previously described in rodent liver during regeneration and tumor promotion and also those seen in rodent hepatomas.

In contrast, acute transforming viruses have substituted viral genes with genetic information specifically implicated in the oncogenic process.

A model system with myeloid cells has identified different myeloid cell colony-inducing proteins, which we called MGI-1 (= CSF, including IL-3). There is another protein that we first described in 1976 and called MGI-2 in 1980 that induces differentiation of myeloid cells to macrophages or granulocytes without inducing the clonal growth of myeloid cells. The four CSF proteins and IL-1 induce the production of MGI-2 in myeloid cells and MGI-2 induces the production of GM-CSF. This shows the participation of MGI-2 in the network of interactions with different myeloid regulatory proteins. Using a monoclonal antibody to MGI-2, amino acid sequencing, and recombinant protein, we have shown in collaboration with the Genetics Institute that the major form of MGI-2 (MGI-2A) is IL-6. This shows that IL-6 is a myeloid cell differentiation inducing protein.

Most often, the donor is a healthy sibling of the patient. Bone marrow harvesting in young children is a very painful procedure requiring anaesthesia; this presents yet more risk for the donor. In order to analyse the specific problems related to this procedure, a retrospective study was carried out on 30 anaesthetic records of marrow-harvesting procedures performed between January 1980 and December 1987. The 30 harvests were carried out in 28 patients (15 boys, 13 girls). Mean age of donors was 6 +/- 0.8 yr (range: 13 months to 17 yr). Twenty-seven patients were classed ASA I and one ASA II. The harvests were all carried out in prone and intubated patients. The volume of removed marrow was 350 +/- 80 ml (range 170 to 600 ml). This was equivalent to a mean 21% estimated blood volume (6-37%). Blood transfusion with phenotyped irradiated blood was carried out in 18 patients, and with autologous blood in one.

Results of a randomized trial.,384-9,"Sixty consecutive patients with untreated acute leukemia alternately received either ABO-matched or ABO-mismatched random-donor platelet transfusions prepared from pooled platelet concentrate stored for 1 to 3 days. Patients were assigned randomly to receive matched or mismatched platelets as their first transfusion, and the first four transfusions were analyzed. In 40 evaluable patients, there was no significant difference (paired t test) between the 10-minute posttransfusion corrected count increments (CCI) of the initial transfusions of matched and mismatched platelets. In contrast, the second matched transfusion was significantly better than the second mismatched transfusion. This effect of ABO compatibility was particularly pronounced in a subset of patients. Six patients in whom mismatched transfusions were consistently inferior to matched transfusions had either a significant increase in anti-A or -B isoagglutinin titers following the first transfusion or elevated titers before or at the conclusion of the study. Conversely, in five patients in whom there was no apparent effect of ABO mismatching, only one had an increase in isoagglutinin titer. Platelet survival was not altered as the ratio of 18-hour to 10-minute posttransfusion CCl was 0.6 for both matched and mismatched platelet transfusions. These data demonstrate that ABO compatibility can affect the results of random-donor platelet transfusions and that patients who experience poor increments from ABO-mismatched platelets may benefit from a trial of ABO-compatible platelets before the initiation of HLA-matched platelet transfusion.","['Lee, E J', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Lee EJ', 'Schiffer CA']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*blood', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Cell Survival', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/therapy', 'Transfusion Reaction']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1989.29589284135.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1989 Jun;29(5):384-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1989.29589284135.x.,,['R01-HL35322-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using transient cotransfection assays, we demonstrate that introduction of the tax gene of either HTLV-I or HTLV-II is sufficient to activate GM-CSF promoter constructs in an unstimulated T-cell line. The GM-CSF 5' flanking sequences previously shown to be sufficient for GM-CSF induction following T-cell activation are also sufficient for activation by the HTLV tax proteins. The sequences required for trans-activation of GM-CSF are distinct from those required for the activation of other T-cell-inducible genes (IL-2R alpha, IL-2) by tax, suggesting that tax can have pleiotropic effects on gene expression in T cells. Constitutive GM-CSF production by HTLV-infected T cells may therefore be due to trans-activation of its promoter by tax. Expression of GM-CSF by HTLV-I infected lymphocytes may be important in the granulocytosis and eosinophilia frequently seen in patients with HTLV-I-induced adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","['Nimer, S D', 'Gasson, J C', 'Hu, K', 'Smalberg, I', 'Williams, J L', 'Chen, I S', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Nimer SD', 'Gasson JC', 'Hu K', 'Smalberg I', 'Williams JL', 'Chen IS', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Jun;4(6):671-6.,,"['CA 018011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These stem cell populations can be selectively quantified with modified spleen colony assays (day 8 and day 12 CFU-S; LCFU-S). It appeared that the most primitive rat hemopoietic stem cell (day 12 CFU-S) was significantly less vulnerable to the freezing and thawing procedure as compared with the clonogenic leukemic cell (30% and 1.4% survival, respectively; p = 0.0026). Survival of the day 8 CFU-S population fell between those percentages (8.6%). In view of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), an attempt was made to extrapolate these and previously reported BNML rat data to man. Taking into account that a) only 1% of the clonogenic leukemic cells survive cryopreservation; b) the fraction of clonogenic leukemic cells in man is approximately 0.001; c) leukemic cells reinfused with the autologous marrow graft may lodge at sites unfavourable for growth; and d) supralethal high-dose chemoradiotherapy significantly hampers the regrowth of leukemia, it becomes rather unlikely that leukemic cells in the autologous marrow graft significantly contribute to a leukemia relapse after ABMT. Therefore, residual leukemia in the host surviving high-dose chemoradiotherapy is the most crucial factor as regards the final outcome of ABMT in acute leukemia.","['Hagenbeek, A', 'Martens, A C']","['Hagenbeek A', 'Martens AC']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', '*Freezing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):535-7.,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 1991 Jan;5(1):90-1.

A cell line, RED-3, is described which was derived from cells of a patient with aggressive acute leukemia which exhibits many markers of lineage infidelity. DNA from this cell line contains an activating point mutation of c-N-ras as well as 20-30-fold amplification of c-myc.

Cell lines known to express ras p21 were used as positive controls and normal peripheral blood was used as a negative control. Intensity of staining for ras p21 (Ip21) was expressed as the ratio of the peak channel numbers of the peak generated by staining with anti-ras p21 to the peak obtained by staining with an isotype control. Using this method, 21 out of 32 clinical specimens of acute leukemia were found to express ras p21 in elevated amounts compared to normal peripheral blood.

Specific c-myc mRNA suppression by dexamethasone.,10904-10,"Glucocorticoids induce growth inhibition and eventually cause cell lysis in certain sensitive leukemic cells. To investigate how glucocorticoids interact with cell growth pathways, we studied the expression of 14 growth-related genes in dexamethasone-treated CEM-C7A cells, a steroid-sensitive clone of the CCRF-CEM cell line, and in several closely related clones. The 14 genes studied were chosen to represent four different levels of mitogenic signal transduction. Detectable mRNA levels were found for 8 of the 14 genes, but among these only c-myc expression was obviously suppressed by dexamethasone. The c-myc mRNA levels declined abruptly during the first 12 h after addition of 1 microM dexamethasone, and maximal suppression occurred by 18 h. This change was not seen in the C7A controls, in the glucocorticoid-resistant, receptor-deficient clone ICR-27, or in the glucocorticoid-resistant, receptor-positive clone C1.

The myelogenous nature of the leukemia is readily apparent in well-differentiated leukemias on the basis of morphology; with poorly differentiated leukemias, positive staining with chloroacetate esterase, nonspecific esterase, and certain monoclonal antibodies such as Mac-1, is helpful to establish myelogenous differentiation. Subgrouping of myelogenous leukemias depends on the presence or absence of monocytic differentiation, as ascertained by staining with Mac-2, electron microscopy or phagocytosis. Leukemias showing no monocytic differentiation can be classified as myeloblastic, corresponding to the FAB M1 and M2 subtypes in humans. Leukemias exhibiting both monocytic and granulocytic features are myelomonocytic, corresponding to the FAB M4 subtype.

Results of these studies have been combined with markers such as surface membrane and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin on B lymphocytes, sheep erythrocyte receptors on T lymphocytes, and cytochemical stains. After using all of the aforementioned markers, it is now clear that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is heterogeneous. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies that identify B cells, such as the anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 antibodies in combination with studies of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, have demonstrated that virtually all cases of non-T-ALL are malignancies of B-cell origin. At least six distinct subgroups of non-T-ALL can now be identified. T-ALL is subdivided by the anti-CD7, anti-CD5, and antibodies that separate T lymphocytes subsets into three primary subgroups. Monoclonal antibodies are also useful in the subclassification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and certain distinct markers can be correlated with morphological classification. Although monoclonal antibodies are useful in distinguishing acute myeloid from acute lymphoid leukemias, they have less certain utility in the subclassification of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Attempts to subclassify AML by differentiation-associated antigens rather than by the French-American-British (FAB) classification are underway in order to document the potential prognostic utility of surface markers. Therapeutic trials using monoclonal antibodies in leukemia and lymphoma have been reported. Intravenous infusion of unlabeled antibodies is the most widely used method; transient responses have been demonstrated. Antibodies conjugated to radionuclides have been quite successful in localizing tumors of less than 1 cm in some studies. Therapy trials with antibodies conjugated to isotopes, toxins, and drugs have shown promise. Purging of autologous bone marrow with monoclonal antibodies and complement in vitro has been used in ALL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; preliminary data suggest that this approach may be an effective therapy and may circumvent many of the obstacles and toxicities associated with in vivo monoclonal antibody infusion.","['Foon, K A']",['Foon KA'],"['Division of Clinical Immunology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/therapy']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0147-0272(89)90018-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1989 Mar-Apr;13(2):57-128. doi: 10.1016/0147-0272(89)90018-4.,376,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 25 patients (39%) achieved complete remission. The median remission duration was 28 weeks with 20% of these patients remaining disease-free at 2 years. The median overall survival was 23 weeks. Prognostic factors associated with differences in remission rates included patient performance status, hemoglobin and platelet levels, and degree of peripheral and marrow blastosis. Factors related to differences in survival were patient age and performance status, hemoglobin and platelet levels, percentage of peripheral blasts, and albumin and bilirubin levels. The toxicity of the regimen was minimal, with 33% of patients requiring hospitalization because of febrile episodes of unknown origin (17%) or documented infections (16%).

Forty-nine patients were transplanted in first complete remission (CR), and 50 patients were transplanted in second and third CR and early relapse. Fifty-three received one of three regimens containing primarily low-dose cyclophosphamide (group I) for graft-v-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis; since March 1983, 46 patients received intravenous (IV) cyclosporine (group II). After December 1983, only cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative blood products were used in appropriate patients, and since April 1984 patients seropositive for herpes-simplex virus (HSV) and CMV received high-dose acyclovir prophylaxis. For patients transplanted in first CR, there was a significantly lower incidence of acute GVHD (P = .005) and deaths related to GVHD and interstitial pneumonitis (P = .001) in patients in group II. This was reflected in an improved Kaplan-Meier probability of disease-free survival (DFS) in the 22 patients transplanted in group II as compared with the 27 patients in group I (64% +/- 10% v 30% +/- 9%, P = .017). The probability of remaining in remission was slightly lower in group II (82% +/- 9% v 94% +/- 6%, P = .479). For patients transplanted in second and third CR and early relapse, the incidence of acute GVHD (P = .026) and deaths related to GVHD and interstitial pneumonitis was significantly lower in group II (P = .029); the probability of remaining in remission was also less (47% +/- 15% v 91% +/- 15%, P = .022). However, the probability of DFS was not significantly different between the two groups (26% +/- 10% v 35% +/- 18%, P = .957). We conclude that transplantation for patients in first CR who received IV cyclosporine therapy is effective treatment; patients with more refractory disease treated with the same cyclosporine regimen (group II) had a lower incidence of GVHD than those treated in group I, but survival did not improve because of an increase in the number of relapses and other nonleukemic complications.","['Geller, R B', 'Saral, R', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Zahurak, M', 'Vogelsang, G B', 'Wingard, J R', 'Ambinder, R F', 'Beschorner, W B', 'Braine, H G', 'Burns, W H']","['Geller RB', 'Saral R', 'Piantadosi S', 'Zahurak M', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Wingard JR', 'Ambinder RF', 'Beschorner WB', 'Braine HG', 'Burns WH', 'et al.']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Postoperative Complications/prevention & control', 'Premedication', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75474-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jun;73(8):2209-18.,,"['P01CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA40282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3-year survival at our hospital is 50%. Recent chemotherapy for acute leukemia is aimed at not only remission induction but also cure of the disease. Although some hematologists claim to stop chemotherapy as early as possible, there is considerable controversy regarding the total length of postremission treatment. Bone marrow transplantation is increasingly used to treat patients with acute leukemia in many facilities. Bone marrow transplantation assures a lower relapse rate than with chemotherapy alone. The limitations are the risk of transplant-related mortality, lack of a histo-compatible donor and advanced age. To achieve substantial improvement in results of AML treatment requires the development of new drugs, and the reduction of transplant-related death.

Such a tactic would decrease turnaround time for results, be less expensive, and reduce exposure of technologists to direct contact with patients' blood. However, presently available instruments fail to detect patients' blood samples with small numbers of abnormal cells, e.g., blasts in early relapse of acute leukemia, atypical lymphocytes in viral diseases such as infectious mononucleosis, eosinophils in allergic or parasitic disease, and band forms in early infectious diseases. Clinical judgment should be used in selectively ordering manual differential counts for these patients. While automated differential counts can be very useful in screening general medical and surgical patients in the ambulatory setting, in referral centers where hematologic abnormalities are more prevalent, the manual differential count and further examination of a smear is particularly necessary at least on initial presentation.

By pairing normal DNA with these ""molecular probes"", the presence of specific genetic sequences may be detected in patient samples. The majority of hematologic diseases arise from hereditary errors, neoplastic change or parasitic organisms. These types of disorders are particularly suited to diagnosis and management using detection of abnormal DNA sequences. Sensitive laboratory techniques employing these molecular probes are now available directly to detect target DNA sequences, assess abnormal short sequences of DNA, and evaluate the presence of abnormal DNA from its transcription products. Using DNA polymerase amplification, the sensitivity of these methods approaches its theoretical limitation of a single gene pair. In hematology, a prevalent application has been the detection of clonal molecular rearrangements which serves as a marker for lymphocytic neoplasia. Other applications of these techniques include the detection of abnormal chromosomal regions such as the Philadelphia chromosome and the detection of deletions of DNA which occur in such diseases as the myeloid dysplastic syndrome. As more human genetic sequences are known, it seems likely that these techniques will become prevalent among methods of laboratory testing.","['Barrows, G H']",['Barrows GH'],"['Department of Pathology, Saint Francis Medical Center, Hartford, CT 06105.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Probes', 'Forecasting', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Hematology/methods/trends', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1989 May-Jun;19(3):139-45.,9,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Probes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A morphologic and immunophenotypic study of 99 cases.,459-71,"Most of the earlier clinicopathologic studies of orbital and conjunctival lymphoid infiltrates were done before the development of immunohistologic methods. In this study, we have examined 99 lymphoid infiltrates of the orbit and conjunctiva immunohistologically and correlated clinical and histologic features with immunophenotype. Sixty-six infiltrates expressed monotypic immunoglobulin; one case was immunoglobulin-negative, B-lineage; and 32 infiltrates expressed polytypic immunoglobulin. Using histologic criteria, 36 cases were malignant (35 monotypic; one immunoglobulin-negative, B-lineage), 44 were indeterminate (31 monotypic, 13 polytypic), and 19 were benign (all polytypic). Combining histologic and immunophenotypic criteria, 67 cases were diagnosed as malignant lymphoma. Seventy-six percent of the lymphomas were classified as low-grade according to the Working Formulation; small lymphocytic lymphoma (45%) was the most common histologic subtype. Cytologic atypia (p less than .0001) and Dutcher bodies (p less than .05) were found only in lymphomas. Similarly, bilateral involvement (p less than .05) and dissemination at time of presentation (p less than .001) occurred only in lymphomas. No other histologic or clinical features reliably distinguished lymphomas from benign orbital and conjunctival lymphoid infiltrates. Nineteen patients had a prior history of extraorbital malignant lymphoma, and eight patients had a history of pseudolymphoma. Patients with a history of malignant lymphoma more often presented with dissemination (p less than .001) and less often had the small lymphocytic subtype (p = .07) than patients without a history of lymphoma. However, not all patients with a history of extraorbital lymphoma had monotypic orbital and conjunctival infiltrates, and the incidence of monotypic orbital and conjunctival lesions in these patients was similar to that of the patients without a history of lymphoma. Patients with a history of pseudolymphoma always presented with localized disease (p less than .01) and more often had benign lesions (p = .08) as compared with patients without a history of pseudolymphoma. We conclude that the presence of either cytologic atypia or Dutcher bodies is a reliable criterion of malignant lymphoma in the orbit and conjunctiva. However, for one-third of the cases in this study, immunohistologic studies were the only means of distinguishing malignant from benign lymphoid infiltrates.","['Medeiros, L J', 'Harris, N L']","['Medeiros LJ', 'Harris NL']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Conjunctiva/*pathology', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Orbital Diseases/*pathology', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-198906000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1989 Jun;13(6):459-71. doi: 10.1097/00000478-198906000-00002.,,,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two general mechanisms of ras mutation were found. In five patients the ras mutation was present in only a fraction of the cells; sometimes appearing in late stages of the disease, suggesting that it can occur in a differentiated cell clone. In six other patients, the ras mutation was present in the great majority of bone marrow or blood cells. The mutation was detected in mature normal lymphocytes and persisted following a complete clinical remission in two of these patients, implying that the ras mutation can occur in an early stage of cell differentiation or stem cell. Patients with a ras mutation had a median survival of nine months (all patients dead) compared to 16 patients without a ras mutation that had a median follow-up of 16 months (10 patients alive; P less than 0.005).

In patients with secondary leukemias and mutagen-related leukemias the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was higher than in those with the idiopathic form of the disease. Specific abnormalities were total or partial loss of chromosome 5 and/or 7, and an additional chromosome 8. In contradistinction to these the patients with primary leukemias had specific translocations associated with pseudodiploidy.

During the first 12 h of treatment with DMSO, MEL cells undergo a temporary decrease in the level of c-myc mRNA, followed by a temporary withdrawal from the cell cycle. We found the same shutoff of DNA synthesis during the first 12 to 30 h after DMSO induction in normal MEL cells (which differentiate) and in c-myc-transfected MEL cells (which do not differentiate). We also examined whether deregulated c-myc expression grossly interfered with the regulation of gene expression during MEL cell differentiation. We used run-on transcription assays to monitor the rate of transcription of four oncogenes (c-myc, c-myb, c-fos, and c-K-ras); all except c-K-ras showed a rapid but temporary decrease in transcription after induction in both c-myc-transfected and control cells. Finally, we found the same regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA expression in both types of cells for four oncogenes and three housekeeping genes associated with growth. We conclude that in the MEL cell system, the effects of deregulated c-myc expression do not occur through a disruption of cell cycle control early in induction, nor do they occur through gross deregulation of gene expression.","['Coppola, J A', 'Parker, J M', 'Schuler, G D', 'Cole, M D']","['Coppola JA', 'Parker JM', 'Schuler GD', 'Cole MD']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Lewis Thomas Laboratory, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.4.1714-1720.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Apr;9(4):1714-20. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.4.1714-1720.1989.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,PMC362590,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies we examined the reactivities of MoAbs H25, H366, and MY9 (singly or combined) with the total leukemic cell population and the leukemic clonogenic cells (L-CFC) from 28 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Using cytofluorography, we found the extent of expression of antigen H25 comparable to MY9 in the majority of patients, and both were more highly expressed than antigen H366. Incubation with H25 and H366 MoAbs simultaneously did not increase the number of positive cells over that seen when stained with H25 alone; however, the amount of antibody fluorescence intensity (FI) was increased. Leukemic cells simultaneously stained with MoAbs H25, H366, and MY9 displayed the highest number of positive cells and FI. Using magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG for depleting antibody-binding cells, greater than or equal to 90% of L-CFC were depleted by a combination of H25 and H366 MoAbs in 76% of AML cases tested as compared to 41% of the cases with MoAb MY9. Using a MoAb cocktail of H25, H366, and MY9, greater than or equal to 90% of L-CFC were depleted in 94% of cases tested, and greater than or equal to 99% of L-CFC were removed in 76% of the cases. Using the same depletion methods for normal bone marrow cells, a combination of anti-H25 and anti-H366 removed 90%, 98%, and 84% of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and multipotent colony-forming units (CFU-GEM), respectively, whereas the cocktail of H25, H366, and MY9 MoAbs removed 98%, 99.5%, and 97% of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEM, respectively. Incubation of H25 and H366-depleted bone marrow cells for 2 weeks in the presence of irradiated adherent cell layers from long-term marrow cultures generated CFU-GM and some BFU-E, as did H25, H366, and MY9-depleted marrow cells, although to a much lesser extent. Based on the overall data, combinations of H25, H366, and MY9 MoAbs and immunomagnetic beads conceivably might have therapeutic potential for ex vivo elimination of leukemic cells from AML remission marrows prior to autologous transplantation.","['Wisniewski, D', 'Strife, A', 'Arlin, Z', 'Knowles, R', 'Lambek, C', 'Gulati, S', 'McHendry, B', 'McKenzie, S', 'Clarkson, B']","['Wisniewski D', 'Strife A', 'Arlin Z', 'Knowles R', 'Lambek C', 'Gulati S', 'McHendry B', 'McKenzie S', 'Clarkson B']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Magnetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jun;3(6):446-52.,,"['CA 19117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell lineages were identified using monoclonal antibodies in an alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase staining method. In general, cultures stimulated with a colony stimulating factor containing conditioned medium (CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) had a higher (approximately 2-fold) mitotic index (MI) than cultures without these growth factors (maximum 7.0 vs. 3.8 after 4-day culture). The significantly higher MI in cultures with growth factors was shown to result from an increase in both erythrocytic and granulocytic-monocytic mitoses. Every culture with CSF and EPO had more erythrocytic metaphases than the identical culture without these growth factors (mean erythrocytic MI 3.1 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01 in healthy subjects; 6.9 vs. 0, p = 0.05 in leukemia). In each of the three patients showing an increased MI where lineage-specific MI was studied, the granulocytic-monocytic MI increased (mean 4.0 vs. 2.1, p = 0.05).

These results indicate that the expression of the c-fes protooncogene and its associated tyrosine kinase activity plays a major role in the initiation of myeloid differentiation.","['Yu, G', 'Smithgall, T E', 'Glazer, R I']","['Yu G', 'Smithgall TE', 'Glazer RI']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transfection']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)81796-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jun 15;264(17):10276-81.,,,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was introduced in 1981 because of its lesser toxicity and equivalent biochemical selectivity and antitumor spectrum relative to cisplatin in preclinical systems. Clinical studies have generally confirmed these expectations and given rise to interesting prospects in current cancer therapeutics. Carboplatin is as effective as cisplatin in ovarian cancer and considerably less toxic. Replacement of cisplatin by carboplatin seems likely in a number of other diseases where cisplatin has played a major role, especially if ongoing phase III studies confirm the regimens are equivalent. Carboplatin may also complement cisplatin's role by its innovative integration into treatment strategies, and by use of it as additional treatment when cisplatin's nonhematologic toxicities are prohibitive. Finally, although it is not likely to possess a different therapeutic spectrum than cisplatin, carboplatin appears to be extending the indications for platinum compounds to new areas such as acute leukemia, endometrial cancer, and breast cancer. In the latter, use of autologous bone marrow reconstitution permits the dose intensity needed for promising therapeutic results. Carboplatin has become the experimental platinum analogue of choice in a wide range of new clinical situations and in combinations with other modalities.","['Muggia, F M']",['Muggia FM'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Southern California Cancer Center, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Carboplatin', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(89)90050-X [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1989 Apr;16(2 Suppl 5):7-13.,41,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of similarity in the percentages of lifetime exposed in the rodent studies and in the occupational setting, the amount metabolized/day as a result of exposures 5 days a week for a lifetime was judged to be an appropriate dose paradigm for this assessment. Derived Michaelis-Menton constants were used to convert the doses of combined metabolites from the pharmacokinetic studies to the doses used in the bioassays. Scaling across species was based on allometric relationships. Experimental data were used to scale doses across species with body weight ratios raised to the exponents of 0.74 for the inhalation route and 1.0 for the oral route. The occupational lifetime cancer risk estimated from rodent data was 6 to 14 cases/1000 workers, which is consistent with the 9.5 to 174 leukemia cases/1000 estimated by others from epidemiological data.

Although the role of c-rel in normal cells is unknown, homology with the Drosophila gene dorsal, which is involved in determining embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity, raises the possibility that c-rel in vertebrates may play a role in differentiation. As a step towards understanding its role in mammalian cells, we have characterized the coding domain of the 7.5 kb murine c-rel mRNA by isolating cDNA clones that span its entire coding domain and part of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The nucleotide sequence reported here indicates that murine c-rel encodes a 588 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 66 kd. The murine protein shares homology with avian v-rel and dorsal over a 300 amino acid stretch within the amino terminus, while the carboxyl terminal regions of these proteins diverge completely. This suggests that the conserved domain of the rel related family of proteins performs a common function that is modulated by the carboxyl terminal domain.","['Grumont, R J', 'Gerondakis, S']","['Grumont RJ', 'Gerondakis S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncogene Res,Oncogene research,8801457,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Turkeys']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene Res. 1989;4(1):1-8.,,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment schedule consisted of three 14-day-cycles of 250 micrograms/m2 rhGM-CSF and 20 mg/m2 ara-C given daily s.c. with four-week treatment-free intervals. In all four evaluable patients the percentage of bone marrow blast cells decreased significantly with an increase in the mature myeloid cells but without bone marrow aplasia. Toxic side effects attributable to the drugs were minor with fever, mild bone pain, erythema and itching at the site of subcutaneous injection of rhGM-CSF. In conclusion, the combined therapy of rhGM-CSF and low-dose ara-C appears to be effective in the short-term control of the leukemic cell population.","['Ganser, A', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Schulz, G', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Ganser A', 'Ottmann OG', 'Schulz G', 'Hoelzer D']","['Dept. of Hematology, University of Frankfurt, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/therapy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000216589 [doi]'],ppublish,Onkologie. 1989 Feb;12(1):13-5. doi: 10.1159/000216589.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although monocytic cells may provide a reservoir for virus production in vivo, their regulation of HIV transcription has not been defined. We now report that HIV gene expression in the monocyte lineage is regulated by NF-kappa B, the same transcription factor known to stimulate the HIV enhancer in activated T cells; however, control of NF-kappa B and HIV in monocytes differs from that observed in T cells. NF-kappa B-binding activity appears during the transition from promonocyte to monocyte in U937 cells induced to differentiate in vitro and is present constitutively in mature monocytes and macrophages. In a chronically infected promonocytic cell, U1, differentiation is associated with HIV-1 replication as well as NF-kappa B binding activity. These findings suggest that NF-kappa B binding activity is developmentally regulated in the monocyte lineage, and that it provides one signal for HIV activation in these cells.","['Griffin, G E', 'Leung, K', 'Folks, T M', 'Kunkel, S', 'Nabel, G J']","['Griffin GE', 'Leung K', 'Folks TM', 'Kunkel S', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/cytology/*microbiology', 'NF-kappa B', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1989/05/04 00:00,1989/05/04 00:01,['1989/05/04 00:00'],"['1989/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/339070a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1989 May 4;339(6219):70-3. doi: 10.1038/339070a0.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,['Nature. 1990 Jan 18;343(6255):218-9.

Hematopoietic progenitor cell growth was markedly impaired in MDS patients as compared to normal controls (p less than 0.05, at least). Recombinant HuGM-CSF supported the growth of CFU-GEMM, CFU-Mk, and BFU-E at lower, equivalent, or slightly higher frequencies that those found in cultures plated with medium conditioned by peripheral blood leukocytes (PHA-LCM), but it was invariably ineffective in improving growth values. Recombinant HuGM-CSF supported the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colonies in 15 of 16 cases. The overall incidence (mean +/- SEM) of CFU-GM in cultures containing rHuGM-CSF (5 ng/ml) was significantly higher than the one found in cultures stimulated with PHA-LCM (40 +/- 15 vs. 17 +/- 7, p less than 0.05). Upon culture with rHuGM-CSF (5 ng/ml), in 5 of 15 patients de novo colony formation was observed (8 +/- 4) and in 4 of 15 patients CFU-GM growth (129 +/- 33) fell within normal range. Doses of rHuGM-CSF higher than 5 ng/ml did not result in a further increase of MDS-derived colony formation. It is concluded that rHuGM-CSF (a) does not improve the growth of CFU-GEMM, CFU-Mk, and BFU-E; (b) may completely restore the growth of CFU-GM in a subgroup of MDS patients; (c) while ineffective in improving anemia and thrombocytopenia, its in vivo in MDS may correct leukopenia through an effect at the level of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell compartment, at least in a subset of highly responsive patients.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Cazzola, M', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Bernasconi, P', 'Dezza, L', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Pedrazzoli, P']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Cazzola M', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Bernasconi P', 'Dezza L', 'Invernizzi R', 'Pedrazzoli P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):363-6.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GM-CSF was given daily as an intravenous injection over a period of 30 min for 5 days. A total of 11 cycles were conducted. Each patient received at least two different dose levels. In three patients, three different dosages were delivered. The treatment course was interrupted by a 10-day rest period. Rh GM-CSF was well tolerated, with only minor side effects seen, which included bone discomfort at the lower back, sternum and ribs, and constitutional symptoms such as low grade fever, nausea/vomiting, and mild myalgias. Whereas no increases in platelet and reticulocyte counts were recorded, elevations of absolute neutrophil counts above 100 cells/microliters occurred in all patients. The most striking finding was, however, the development of increases in the number of circulating and bone marrow blast counts that were observed particularly when doses of greater than or equal to 500 micrograms/m2 of body surface area were administered. In line with data demonstrating in vitro induction of proliferation of leukemic blast cells by rh GM-CSF, one may take advantage of blastogenesis induced in vivo that may favor the use of a therapeutic strategy by recruiting quiescent cells into the mitotic cycle which would then represent optimum targets for a subsequent cycle-specific cytotoxic chemotherapy. Such an approach could form the basis for new clinical trials in MDS.","['Herrmann, F', 'Lindemann, A', 'Klein, H', 'Lubbert, M', 'Schulz, G', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Herrmann F', 'Lindemann A', 'Klein H', 'Lubbert M', 'Schulz G', 'Mertelsmann R']","['Department of Hematology, University of Mainz, F.R.G.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/therapy', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):335-8.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to stimulate the growth of myeloid leukemic cells in vitro, we have evaluated the ability of this growth factor to enhance leukemic clonogenic cell kill in the presence of ARA-C. In seven patients studied, GM-CSF increased the fraction of myeloid leukemic blasts in S phase as measured by propidium iodide DNA staining, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, or ARA-C suicide techniques. Six of these seven patients demonstrated clonogenic cell growth in agar in response to GM-CSF. In five of these six patients, the combination of GM-CSF and ARA-C treatment in vitro resulted in a significant increase in leukemic clonogenic cell kill when compared to treatment with ARA-C in the absence of GM-CSF. Similar results were observed with the combination of GM-CSF and hydroxyurea, another S phase specific agent, further suggesting that the observed enhancement of cytotoxicity was due to the ability of GM-CSF to increase the number of leukemic cells in S phase. These data provide a rationale for investigating the toxicity and efficacy of combined GM-CSF and ARA-C therapy in patients with high-risk myeloid leukemia.","['Cannistra, S A', 'Groshek, P', 'Griffin, J D']","['Cannistra SA', 'Groshek P', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):328-34.,,"['CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to clarify these hypotheses, we analysed comparatively the kinetics of variations in c-myc mRNA expression, hemoglobin synthesis, DNA and RNA syntheses, cell cycle kinetics and self-renewal capability in normal and hemin-treated K562 leukemia cells exposed for different periods of time to the antitumoral antibiotic doxorubicin. Times of exposure to doxorubicin were either 2 h, which resulted in reversible induction of hemoglobin synthesis without significant cytostatic effects, or continuously for more than 5 days, which resulted in an irreversible induction of hemoglobin synthesis and in the complete and irreversible loss of self-renewal activity. Comparative analysis of the experimental data indicated that the decrease in c-myc mRNA expression correlated with the loss of replicative activity, possibly due to an irreversible cytostatic effect of the long exposure to doxorubicin, but not with the commitment to the differentiation programs.","['Toffoli, G', 'Viel, A', 'Bevilacqua, C', 'Maestro, R', 'Tumiotto, L', 'Boiocchi, M']","['Toffoli G', 'Viel A', 'Bevilacqua C', 'Maestro R', 'Tumiotto L', 'Boiocchi M']","['Experimental Oncology 1, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90064-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(4):279-87. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90064-7.,,,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress has been slow in defining specific clinicopathological entities to this particular group of NHL. In order to elucidate the specific characteristics of PTCL, a direct comparison of PTCL with a group of diffuse B-cell lymphomas (DBCL) was performed. Between June 1983 and December 1987, we studied 114 adults with NHL, using a battery of immunophenotyping markers. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome, follicular lymphoma, well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, and true histiocytic lymphoma were excluded from this study since these are distinct clinicopathologic entities with well-recognized immunophenotypes. Of the remaining 75 patients, 70 who had adequate clinical information were analyzed, and of these, 34 were PTCL and 36 were DBCL. Classified according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Formulation (WF), 68% of PTCL and 31% of DBCL were high-grade lymphomas. Clinical and laboratory features were similar, except PTCL had a characteristic skin involvement and tended to present in more advanced stages with more constitutional symptoms. Induction chemotherapy was homogeneous in both groups, and complete remission rates were 62% for PTCL and 67% for DBCL. Patients with DBCL had a better overall survival than patients with PTCL, but the survival benefit disappeared after patients were stratified according to intermediate- or high-grade lymphoma. A subgroup of PTCL patients who had received less intensive induction chemotherapy was found to have a very unfavorable outcome. We conclude that (1) PTCL follows the general grading concept proposed in WF classification; (2) within a given intermediate or high grade, PTCL and DBCL respond comparably to treatment; (3) the intensity of induction chemotherapy has a crucial impact on the outcome of PTCL patients; and (4) with a few exceptions, the clinical and laboratory features of PTCL and DBCL are comparable.","['Cheng, A L', 'Chen, Y C', 'Wang, C H', 'Su, I J', 'Hsieh, H C', 'Chang, J Y', 'Hwang, W S', 'Su, W C', 'Liu, T W', 'Tien, H F']","['Cheng AL', 'Chen YC', 'Wang CH', 'Su IJ', 'Hsieh HC', 'Chang JY', 'Hwang WS', 'Su WC', 'Liu TW', 'Tien HF', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma/classification/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Taiwan']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.6.725 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Jun;7(6):725-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.6.725.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of primary unfractionated murine bone marrow by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and human bone marrow by IL-3 or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was inhibited by TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2, while the proliferation of murine bone marrow by GM-CSF or murine and human marrow with G-CSF was not inhibited. Mouse and human hematopoietic colony formation was differentially affected by TGF-beta 1. In particular, CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and HPP-CFC, the most immature colonies, were inhibited by TGF-beta 1, whereas the more differentiated unipotent CFU-G, CFU-M, and CFU-E were not affected. TGF-beta 1 inhibited IL-3-induced growth of murine leukemic cell lines within 24 h, after which the cells were still viable. Subsequent removal of the TGF-beta 1 results in the resumption of normal growth. TGF-beta 1 inhibited the growth of factor-dependent NFS-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, CSF-1, IL-4, or IL-6. TGF-beta 1 inhibited the growth of a variety of murine and human myeloid leukemias, while erythroid and macrophage leukemias were insensitive. Lymphoid leukemias, whose normal cellular counterparts were markedly inhibited by TGF-beta, were also resistant to TGF-beta 1 inhibition. These leukemic cells have no detectable TGF-beta 1 receptors on their cell surface. Last, TGF-beta 1 directly inhibited the growth of isolated Thy-1-positive progenitor cells. Thus, TGF-beta may be an important modulator of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cell growth.","['Keller, J R', 'Sing, G K', 'Ellingsworth, L R', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Keller JR', 'Sing GK', 'Ellingsworth LR', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Biological Carcinogenesis Development Program, Program Resources, Inc., Frederick, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*physiology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240390209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1989 Feb;39(2):175-84. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240390209.,26,['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report, in 20 patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 5), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 5), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 5), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 5), that the nature of the cells treated (i.e., buffy coat cells or mononuclear cells) significantly influences the accuracy of the LD95 determination, whereas other parameters such as hematocrit or nucleated cell concentration do not. We subsequently define the most reliable experimental procedure for in vitro purging with Mafosfamide: incubation of 2 x 10(7) buffy coat cells/ml with a hematocrit of 5%. We show that the wide individual susceptibility to the drug is not related to any incubation procedure. In a series of 163 patients with hematological malignancies, we confirm the large variation of sensitivity to the drug according to patient susceptibility and diagnosis.

Etoposide, although similar in chemical structure to podophyllotoxin, has a different mechanism of cytotoxicity compared with its parent compound. Etoposide may stabilize type II topoisomerase-DNA complexes, preventing rejoining of single- and double-strand DNA breaks. Etoposide may also require cellular activation into intermediates, which then bind to DNA and disrupt cellular function. Oral etoposide has an average bioavailability of 50% (range, 17%-137%), with substantial intrapatient and interpatient variability. Etoposide is widely distributed in the body and is highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 95%). Approximately 50% (range, 20%-81%) of an etoposide dose is recovered in the urine as parent drug or glucuronide, with the remainder of the dose being unaccounted for. The disposition of etoposide in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction is discussed. Etoposide is effective in combination with other agents against lung cancer, and response rates of 90% in small-cell lung cancer have been observed. When etoposide is used in combination with other agents, response rates of approximately 80% have been observed in patients with testicular cancer. The activity of etoposide in treating leukemia, lymphoma, and breast and ovarian carcinomas and other tumors is discussed. The impact of etoposide on prolonging survival in lung and testicular cancer is addressed, and studies evaluating the pharmacodynamics of etoposide are described. Adverse effects associated with etoposide therapy include myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and hypotension after rapid intravenous administration.

The important finding in this study was the high complete remission rate rapidly obtained in patients with relapsed or refractory AML without using an anthracycline.","['Gore, M', 'Powles, R', 'Lakhani, A', 'Milan, S', 'Maitland, J', 'Goss, G', 'Nandi, A', 'Perren, T', 'Forgeson, G', 'Treleaven, J']","['Gore M', 'Powles R', 'Lakhani A', 'Milan S', 'Maitland J', 'Goss G', 'Nandi A', 'Perren T', 'Forgeson G', 'Treleaven J', 'et al.']","['leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Recurrence']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00435839 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;23(6):373-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00435839.,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subgroups of patients who should be considered candidates for highly experimental therapy include infants (less than 1 year of age), patients with the Philadelphia chromosome and perhaps patients with B-cell leukemia. The most important factor that determines the success of therapy after relapse is the length of the patient's initial remission. We recommend bone marrow transplantation for children whose first remission did not exceed 18 months. For all others, it appears that intensive chemotherapy affords as great a potential for cure as one could expect from transplantation. We favor intensive chemotherapy over transplantation in cases of late bone marrow relapse (greater than 18 months), because of the currently high peritransplantation mortality rate. It is not clear whether either modality will be adequate for patients relapsing on contemporary treatment programs.","['Rivera, G K', 'Santana, V', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Buchanan, G', 'Crist, W M']","['Rivera GK', 'Santana V', 'Mahmoud H', 'Buchanan G', 'Crist WM']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, Memphis.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Prognosis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Jan;4 Suppl 1:80-5.,36,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some criticisms of this codification are presented and other approaches to classification are discussed. Among these are included the potential importance of multiple lineage expression, measurements of cell differentiation using cytochemical criteria, surface antigenic differences as demonstrated by the use of monoclonal antibodies and the growing contribution of cytogenetics.

The value of these high dose cytoreductive programs with ABMT is not yet known. No randomized studies have been done yet indicating that ABMT is superior to conventional dose chemotherapy. Besides, the diversity of regimens and patient populations make evaluation of results extremely difficult.

However, a substantial proportion of these patients die with progressive treatment-resistant disease or from intractable infections resulting from CLL-related immunodeficiency. In many of these patients biological transformation of the leukaemia cells can be associated with the appearance of complex chromosomal changes not present earlier or additional to the commonly present trisomy 12(1). In a broad sense, therefore, all of these patients may be said to undergo lethal transformation of their disease in contrast to the, admittedly substantial numbers, especially of elderly males who die from causes totally unrelated to their CLL, especially cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and other malignant diseases. In the narrow sense the term 'terminal transformation' is usually restricted to those conditions in which the terminal event is the proliferation of a new population of lymphoid cells of enhanced malignancy. There are three well-known types of transformation. One, 'prolymphrocytoid' transformation is relatively low-grade, while the other two, 'Richter's syndrome' and 'immunoblastic transformation' are rapidly progressive conditions. The last two account for about 5% of all deaths in CLL, but the slowly progressive prolymphocytoid transformation has been described too recently to permit reliable estimates of its frequency in unselected series to CLL.

The 4-year leukaemia-free survival is 45 to 55%. The major determining factors are disease status at diagnosis, patient age, the occurrence of graft-versus-host post-transplant and the use of T-cell depletion. Haematological or cytogenetic relapse is rare in patients transplanted with T-replete marrow in chronic phase but common in recipients of T-depleted donor marrow cells. This observation provides strong evidence for the importance of a graft-versus-leukaemia effect, which may be especially important after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for CML.

Since these studies have been done almost exclusively by Northern and dot-blot analyses using mixed populations of cells, any conclusions concerning quantitative changes in gene expression are difficult to document. We have developed a rapid and sensitive RNA-in situ hybridization technique permitting detection of as few as 5 copies of mRNA per individual cell. Using this technique we have studied the expression levels of several oncogenes including MYC, SIS, FMS, p53, FOS and RAF in both normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow (BM) cells obtained from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients at presentation, at relapse and in complete remission (CR). Two of these oncogenes, MYC and SIS, are expressed at levels at least 2-5-fold higher in hematopoietic cells obtained from leukemia patients than in any normal hematopoietic cell examined, including cells obtained from regenerating bone marrow. The proportion of abnormal cells correlated well with the percentage of blast cells determined by morphological examination. In 7 out of 10 AML patients in morphological remission, a subpopulation of cells is detectable with abnormally high levels of MYC and/or SIS mRNA. These high levels of MYC expression are similar to those found in BM cells obtained from AML patients at presentation or relapse, but the percentage of cells with this abnormality is generally much lower. Continued follow-up of these patients has shown that 5 of them relapsed within 8 months. At this time, none of the 3 patients which were negative for MYC overexpression has relapsed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Evinger-Hodges, M J', 'Spinolo, J A', 'Spencer, V', 'Nieto, P', 'Dicke, K A']","['Evinger-Hodges MJ', 'Spinolo JA', 'Spencer V', 'Nieto P', 'Dicke KA']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Bone Marrow/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/analysis', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogenes', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Jan;4 Suppl 1:13-5.,,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice irradiated with greater than 9 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) rejection is minimal, whereas after administration of 8 Gy TBI, which spares a significant number of clonable T cells, a substantial frequency of host stem cells can also be detected. In current murine models, unlike in humans, bone marrow allograft rejection is generally associated with full autologous hematopoietic reconstitution. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the myeloablative drug dimethyl myleran (DMM) on chimerism status following transplantation of T cell-depleted allogenic bone marrow (using C57BL/6 donors and C3H/HeJ recipients, conditioned with 8 Gy TBI). Donor type chimerism 1 to 2 months post-transplant of 1 to 3 x 10(6) bone marrow cells was markedly enhanced by using DMM one day after TBI and prior to transplantation. Conditioning with cyclophosphamide instead of DMM, in combination with 8 Gy TBI, did not enhance engraftment of donor type cells. Artificial reconstitution of T cells, after conditioning with TBI plus DMM, by adding mature thymocytes, or presensitization with irradiated donor type spleen cells 1 week before TBI and DMM, led to strong graft rejection and consequently to severe anemia. The anti-donor responses in these models were proportional to the number of added T cells and to the number of cells used for presensitization, and they could be neutralized by increasing the bone marrow inoculum. These results demonstrate the potential of DMM to facilitate engraftment in unsensitized mice in which the host stem cells may compete with donor type cells; the use of DMM to create models in which mechanisms of immune rejection can be studied without interference due to stem cell competition; and that bone marrow allograft rejection may be overcome by increasing the bone marrow inoculum in these stringent models.","['Lapidot, T', 'Terenzi, A', 'Singer, T S', 'Salomon, O', 'Reisner, Y']","['Lapidot T', 'Terenzi A', 'Singer TS', 'Salomon O', 'Reisner Y']","['Department of Biophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Immunization', 'Lectins', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peanut Agglutinin', 'Preoperative Care', 'Radiation Chimera/*drug effects', 'Spleen', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', '*Tissue Donors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75523-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):2025-32.,,,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Peanut Agglutinin)', '55-93-6 (dimethylmyleran)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from most acute leukemias (19 of 22), irrespective of their subtype (T, common or nonlymphoid leukemias), as well as T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas expressed only the p70-75 beta subunit of the IL-2 receptor. Cells from the more mature B-cell neoplasms, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, expressed predominantly alpha beta IL-2 receptors (11 of 14). In contrast to these results, most cell lines established from hematopoietic malignancies do not express either chain of the IL-2 receptor.

The growth-promoting activity is produced by fresh or irradiated cells and resembles the activity of interleukin-3 (IL-3) in its ability to sustain colony formation from three of four IL-3-dependent cell lines and to induce formation of granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colonies and, in the presence of erythropoietin (Ep), of erythroid bursts and mixed erythroid colonies. IL-3, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, GM colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, M-CSF, Ep, and media conditioned by concanavalin A-stimulated mouse spleen cells or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated LBRM 33 cells were unable to induce proliferation of the Rauscher erythroleukemia cells. Northern analysis of total and polyA-selected RNA extracted from untreated Rauscher cells or from cells 24 hours after irradiation showed the presence of message for M-CSF but not for IL-3, IL-1, GM-CSF, or G-CSF. The production of IL-6 was excluded by a sensitive bioassay. These results indicate that the autocrine growth of the Rauscher cell line is mediated by a growth factor different from IL-3, but with similar biological activity. Activation of the expression of such a growth factor during viral infection may contribute to the generation of leukemic cells that have the property to grow in vitro and generate Rauscher erythroleukemia cell lines.","['Migliaccio, G', 'Migliaccio, A R', 'Ruscetti, S', 'Adamson, J W']","['Migliaccio G', 'Migliaccio AR', 'Ruscetti S', 'Adamson JW']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', 'Growth Substances/isolation & purification', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75487-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):1770-7.,,['CA-31615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proportional hazards regression models using acute GVHD and chronic GVHD as time-dependent covariates demonstrated a significant association of GVHD with a decreased relative risk (RR, 0.33 to 0.42) of relapse in patients with ANL, ALL, and CML transplanted in advanced disease. Among patients developing either acute or chronic GVHD, treatment failure (that is, mortality or relapse) was decreased in patients with ALL transplanted in relapse (RR = 0.70, P less than .033) and CML in blast crisis (RR = 0.37, P less than .009). This effect was independent of age, sex, preparative regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, or length of follow-up. Five-year actuarial estimates were derived for the subset of 657 patients who survived in remission 150 days after transplant and were at risk for development of chronic GVHD. Among patients with ANL in first remission or CML in chronic phase, GVHD had an adverse effect on survival and no apparent influence on relapse. Among patients with ANL and ALL transplanted in relapse, the probability of relapse after day 150 was 74% without [corrected] GVHD, 45% with acute and chronic GVHD, 35% with [corrected] only acute GVHD, and 34% with only chronic GVHD (P less than .001).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six healthy volunteers were stimulated with the mitogens phytohemaglutinin and concanavalin A, and also cocultivated with human epidermal cell cultures. Incubation times with mitogens and epidermal cells were four days and stimulation of the lymphocytes by mitogens was confirmed by standard 3H-thymidine uptake. Standard transmission electron microscopy showed that in the mitogen-driven system 20% to 60% (33 +/- 15%) and in the epidermal cell-driven system 5% to 15% (8 +/- 4%) of the lymphoid cells exhibited mild to moderate indentation of the nuclei with nuclear contour indices (NCI) of 4.6 to 6.5 but no Sezary cells were observed (cells with NCI greater than 6.5 and up to 19.2). In the mitogen-stimulated preparation 2% to 5% (3 +/- 1%) of the lymphoid cells showed nuclear multilobulation resembling the cells seen in adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia. Incubation of mononuclear cells for longer periods of up to 4 weeks with mitogens and exogenous IL-2 resulted in no further morphologic changes. Using an indirect immunogold technique at the electron microscopic level, the cells showing nuclear indentation or lobulation were shown to bear both T helper (CD4) and T suppressor (CD8) cell phenotypes in a similar ratio to the total numbers of T helper and T suppressor cells present. Mitogens and epidermal cells are thus not able to induce a morphologic change to Sezary cells in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.","['Chu, A C', 'Morris, J F']","['Chu AC', 'Morris JF']","['Unit of Dermatology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Sezary Syndrome/*pathology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78964-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1603-7.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Mitogens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemically, a high proportion of hypergranular cases showed significant alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) staining and simultaneous chloroacetate esterase, and ANAE expression by single cells was commonly seen. These atypical staining patterns were, however, not a feature of hypogranular cases. Immunophenotypic studies revealed that most hypergranular M3 cases were HLA-DR- and that monocyte-associated membrane CD14 expression was low in all cases tested. In addition, serum lysozyme concentrations (20 cases) were generally within the normal range and thus inconsistent with monocytic involvement in the leukaemic process. The significance of atypical ANAE staining of leukaemic promyelocytes was further examined by analysing ANAE isoenzyme components (defined by isoelectric focusing) in 11 cases. The patterns obtained (G1 and G2) were identical to those found in normal granulocytes and did not show any evidence of monocyte-associated esterase isoenzyme expression. On the basis of these findings, it is considered that the differentiation process in acute promyelocytic leukaemia is relatively well conserved and that the atypical esterase cytochemistry of hypergranular promyelocytes does not reflect their mixed lineage nature but is simply a consequence of increased granulation.","['Scott, C S', 'Patel, D', 'Drexler, H G', 'Master, P S', 'Limbert, H J', 'Roberts, B E']","['Scott CS', 'Patel D', 'Drexler HG', 'Master PS', 'Limbert HJ', 'Roberts BE']","['Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb06310.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Apr;71(4):505-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb06310.x.,,,['EC 3.1.- (Esterases)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients from six centres were entered and treated with standard dose ara-C for 7 or 10 d and an anthracycline for the first 3 d. Patients aged less than 60 years and with greater than 30% bone marrow biopsy cellularity or greater than 10% abnormal cells on the aspirate obtained 6 d after the start of therapy were augmented with cytosine arabinoside 3 g/m2 every 12 h on days 8, 9 and 10.

There was a highly statistically significant difference between augmented and nonaugmented patients (P less than 0.001) for the per cent biopsy cellularity and per cent abnormal cells in the day 6 marrow. The CR rate for augmented patients was 69% and for nonaugmented patients 60% suggesting that augmentation therapy abrogated the prognostic significance of more extensive residual leukaemia in the day 6 bone marrow. The results suggest that augmentation of remission induction for patients with poor bone marrow cytoreduction detected 6 d after initiation of therapy, may salvage patients who are destined to fail remission induction because of resistant disease without producing excessive toxicity.","['Browman, G', 'Preisler, H', 'Raza, A', 'Syracuse, K', 'Azarnia, N', 'Benger, A', 'Chervenick, P', ""D'Arrigo, P"", 'Doeblin, T', 'Goldberg, J']","['Browman G', 'Preisler H', 'Raza A', 'Syracuse K', 'Azarnia N', 'Benger A', 'Chervenick P', ""D'Arrigo P"", 'Doeblin T', 'Goldberg J', 'et al.']","['Hamilton Regional Cancer Center, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb06308.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Apr;71(4):493-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb06308.x.,,"['CA-28734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-91285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall response rates were very similar (59 and 62% for the ciprofloxacin and piperacillin arms, respectively). The response for the gram-positive bacteremias was almost identical (around 40%); this low response was due in part to an outbreak of infection by a multiply resistant strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (for which the ciprofloxacin MIC was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml) which occurred during the second half of the trial.

The type, frequency, and permanence of these central nervous system (CNS) changes depend primarily on the therapy itself, although the contribution of additional factors, such as young age, may be substantial. Neurotoxicity in patients who have received 2,400 cGy cranial irradiation plus 5 concurrent doses of intrathecal methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis has been characterized more fully than the CNS changes accompanying other forms of therapy. Cross-sectional studies using cranial computed tomography scans to evaluate structural changes in the brain have shown ventricular dilatation in 15%, white matter hypodensity in 3.5%, and calcifications in 8%. The principal neuroendocrine effect is decreased growth velocity during therapy and adolescence, with significant decreases in final height in approximately one-third of children. Secondary cerebral gliomas with a poor prognosis are being reported with increasing regularity, but the true risk of this complication is still unknown. Use of parenteral methotrexate as the sole method of CNS prophylaxis is associated with transient focal white matter hypodensity. Neuroendocrine and neuropsychologic sequelae associated with this therapy are minimal; however, much of the available information is based on patients treated with regimens that had unacceptably high CNS relapse rates or whose length of follow-up was brief. With more aggressive, and hence more effective, prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate, spinal cord myelopathy may become a significant new area of neurotoxicity. Clinically significant CNS toxicity develops in the majority of patients who receive treatment for meningeal relapse. The leukemia itself is a prime contributing factor to this neurotoxicity. In patients who are subsequently cured of leukemia, acute neurotoxicity consists mainly of seizures; the most significant sequelae appearing after the cessation of therapy consists of significant drops in full scale IQ.","['Ochs, J J']",['Ochs JJ'],"[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Central Nervous System/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neurosecretory Systems/abnormalities', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-198921000-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1989 Spring;11(1):93-105. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198921000-00019.,117,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One is the need for early recognition of subclinical nonsymptomatic disease, or occult meningeal leukemia. By obtaining spinal fluid specimens, one can frequently monitor the central nervous system (CNS) for the presence of residual or recurrent leukemia. Methods for identifying small numbers of lymphoblasts in the spinal fluid have progressed from subjective descriptions of nucleated cells to assignment of objective methods for labeling the cells in question. These more sensitive methods of detection have challenged the ""old"" definitions of remission. The unequivocal identification of lymphoblasts in the spinal fluid of a child with less than 5 cells/mm3 of fluid is an example of such a dilemma. Does this finding herald overt CNS relapse or hematologic relapse? Does it warrant further, more aggressive treatment beyond giving standard prophylactic CNS therapy? It can be suggested that the finding of even a small number or proportion of leukemic cells in the spinal fluid in a child being given continuation/maintenance therapy has a high probability of being followed by an adverse event (relapse). If this is true, then the definition of CNS leukemia needs refinement and the methods for unequivocally identifying leukemic cells in a spinal fluid sample depend on techniques of cytologic examination beyond routine cytomorphology. Such laboratory methods are now available, but they require more clinical testing and standardization before their sensitivity and specificity in identifying leukemic cells is established.","['Lauer, S J', 'Kirchner, P A', 'Camitta, B M']","['Lauer SJ', 'Kirchner PA', 'Camitta BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/immunology/pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-198921000-00016 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1989 Spring;11(1):64-73. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198921000-00016.,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific risk factors for this complication included the number of courses of cranial irradiation, a young age at treatment, increasing time since treatment, neuropathological changes apparent on abnormal computed tomography scans of the brain, and seizures. The methodological problems inherent in neurobehavioral research in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia are critically reviewed and suggestions for future studies are offered.

Its aetiology, incidence and treatment.",46-58,"Priapism is characterised by a persistent erection that cannot be relieved by sexual intercourse or masturbation. Although priapism subsides spontaneously in a few days, impotence frequently follows. Both vascular and neural mechanisms are implicated in the pathophysiology of priapism, but it is not clear which initiates the process. Idiopathic cases of priapism are the most frequent (near 50%); other medical conditions that can result in priapism are haematological diseases (mainly sickle cell anaemia and leukaemia), traumatism, and neoplastic processes. Drug-induced priapism comprises about 30% of cases. The drugs most frequently implicated are psychotropic drugs (phenothiazines and trazodone), antihypertensives (mainly prazosin) and heparin. Recently, the intracavernosal injection of vasoactive drugs (papaverine and phentolamine) has been described in patients treated for impotence. With the exception of heparin, an alpha-adrenergic blocking mechanism has been suggested in the priapism-inducing action of these drugs. A significant number of anecdotal case reports link priapism and drugs, and it is possible that certain cases of idiopathic priapism could be reclassified if accurate pharmacological anamnesis were to be performed. Priapism must be considered a urological emergency. Surgical procedures are the most preferred treatment for this condition but, in selected cases, drug treatment seems to be an alternative approach.","['Banos, J E', 'Bosch, F', 'Farre, M']","['Banos JE', 'Bosch F', 'Farre M']","['Departament de Farmacologia i Psiquiatria, Facultat de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp,Medical toxicology and adverse drug experience,8709214,IM,"['Anticoagulants/adverse effects', 'Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Agents/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Priapism/*chemically induced/etiology/physiopathology/therapy']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03259902 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp. 1989 Jan-Feb;4(1):46-58. doi: 10.1007/BF03259902.,160,,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antihypertensive Agents)', '0 (Central Nervous System Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have clearly demonstrated that blast cells from eight cases of acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) showed greater morphological deterioration and loss of cytoplasmic enzymes with continuous heating at temperatures of 40-43 degrees C than normal marrow mononuclear cells obtained from ten controls. Survival of L-CFU also decreased exponentially with rising temperature whereas GM-CFU were not markedly affected, even at a temperature of 43 degrees C for 30 min. These results suggest that human L-CFU are more sensitive to hyperthermic killing than normal human GM-CFU and that hyperthermia might selectively purge residual leukaemic cells in vitro. Hyperthermia may have a role in clinical autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for acute leukaemia.","['Da, W M', 'Liu, Y', 'Wei, S N']","['Da WM', 'Liu Y', 'Wei SN']","['Department of Hematology, Lanzhou General Hospital, Gansu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90014-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(3):217-20. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90014-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is of clinical relevance, since we recently showed that low level expression of this proto-oncogene mainly occurs in advanced stage disease of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with progressive course of the disease (Greil R, Gattringer C, Fasching B, Cleveland J, Thaler J, Radaskiewicz T, Gastl G, Huber C, Rapp U, Huber H: Int J Cancer 42:529 1988). When numerous technical parameters were tested for the adaptation of the method, fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, gelatin coating of the slides, the time concentration product of proteinase K, and the kind of labeling had the greatest impact on results and successful performance of the technique. When the optimized method was applied to the v-abl-transformed NIH 3T3-, the K 562 CML blast cell line and to nine cases of lowly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphomas it semiquantitatively discriminated the varying amounts of v-abl, bcr/c-abl and c-abl mRNA expressed within these cells. Parallel analysis with Northern blotting confirmed the specificity of the method and pointed to a very high sensitivity, including the capacity to detect only few c-abl mRNA molecules/cell. An essential advantage of in situ hybridization was the detection of inhomogeneous expression of the c-abl mRNA within subpopulations of the malignant clone. In addition, this technique might be of particular importance when a gene is only weakly expressed on a small fraction of cells which might easily escape the detection by Northern blotting. Immunocytochemical investigation suggested parallel expression of the oncoprotein in six of seven c-abl mRNA positive cases as well as high specificity and sensitivity for the polyclonal and to a lesser extent for one monoclonal antibody. However, because of the high potential of cross-reactivity of anti-oncoprotein antibodies, parallel investigations on the mRNA level should be performed particularly when new anti-oncoprotein antibodies are applied. Our results demonstrate that this can be performed using in situ hybridization, even when the number of mRNA targets is very low.","['Greil, R', 'Fasching, B', 'Huber, H']","['Greil R', 'Fasching B', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma/*analysis/genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Probes', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1989 Apr;60(4):574-82.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously (SC) daily so as to achieve prolonged blood levels and to establish an outpatient treatment regimen. Four dose levels were administered for ten days: 0.3 microgram/kg/d (three patients), 1.0 microgram/kg/d (three), 3.0 micrograms/kg/d (four), and 10.0 micrograms/kg/d (six). The most common toxicities were fever and a flu-like syndrome, which were dose-dependent. The maximum-tolerated dose was 10.0 micrograms/kg/d, which induced severe rigors (two patients), fever greater than 40 degrees C (one), severe bronchospasm (one), and WBC 60,000 (one). In one patient, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) progressed to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia after two doses of GM-CSF, and the patient died of leukemia that did not respond to chemotherapy. After doses of 3.0 and 10.0 micrograms/kg, serum GM-CSF levels peaked at 3.8 to 6.3 hours, and persisted for 14 and 24 hours, respectively. Circulating granulocytes (neutrophils and bands) increased in a dose-dependent manner, as 11 of 13 patients who received greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/kg/d responded with a two- to 194-fold increase. Although the neutrophils usually returned to pretreatment levels shortly after stopping GM-CSF, two patients continue to exhibit an elevation of neutrophils for 6 months. Dose-related increases in circulating monocytes and eosinophils were also noted. Transient increases in platelet and reticulocyte counts were observed in two and three patients, respectively. Five of the 16 patients later received maintenance GM-CSF at 3 micrograms/kg/d for 2 to 9 weeks. All showed a dramatic increase in neutrophils after 2 weeks. Thereafter, despite continued therapy, the neutrophil count in four patients declined markedly. In conclusion, GM-CSF is well tolerated by the SC route and induces striking, but usually temporary, improvement in the neutropenia of MDS. Larger prospective phase III trials will determine the duration of hematologic responses and the impact on infection, morbidity, and mortality.","['Thompson, J A', 'Lee, D J', 'Kidd, P', 'Rubin, E', 'Kaufmann, J', 'Bonnem, E M', 'Fefer, A']","['Thompson JA', 'Lee DJ', 'Kidd P', 'Rubin E', 'Kaufmann J', 'Bonnem EM', 'Fefer A']","['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.5.629 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 May;7(5):629-37. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.5.629.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the marked differences in FFR, no statistically significant difference in survival could be demonstrated between the various stages. Selected patients with advanced SL received no initial therapy; these patients had a 10-year survival that was not statistically different from the immediately treated stage III and IV patients.

Mice injected with BCL1 cells exposed for 1 or 2 h showed no sign of leukemia. Lethally irradiated mice were successfully reconstituted with mixtures of syngeneic bone marrow (BM) and BCL1 cells treated with MC540 following exposure to white light. Exposure of BM/BCL1 mixtures for 2 h proved to be effective in purging all BCL1 cells without affecting BM viability, as documented by normal hemopoietic reconstitution of all recipients surviving without evidence of leukemia. All recipients of untreated BM/BCL1 cell mixtures developed leukemia within 42 days. Adoptive transfer of 10(6) spleen cells obtained from treated mice into secondary naive syngeneic recipients was carried out in order to test for dormant BCL1 cells in treated recipients. No leukemia developed in any of the secondary recipients. Previous studies indicate that as few as 10, or possibly less, BCL1 cells are sufficient to cause lethal disease in BALB/c recipients.

Hemostatic efficiency depends on the rate of formation of hemostatic plugs as well as the structural integrity and stability of the formed hemostatic plugs. Fibrin elements are major constituents contributing to the structural integrity and stability, but they are subject to fibrinolytic activity occurring spontaneously after fibrin formation. Fibrinolysis is usually suppressed by endogenous inhibitors. Increase of a profibrinolytic component or deficiency of an inhibitor would result in an accelerated fibrinolysis, causing a premature lysis of hemostatic plugs before restoration of injured vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic tendency. Such a state can be seen typically in patients with congenital deficiency of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor or a hereditary increase of plasminogen activator, and it is also seen in acquired situations such as amyloidosis, liver cirrhosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (particularly in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia) and thrombolytic therapy. The hemorrhagic tendency can be well controlled by an administration of an antifibrinolytic agent: epsilon-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid. In contrast to an accelerated fibrinolysis causing a hemorrhagic tendency, retarded fibrinolysis may predispose an individual to a thrombotic tendency. Retarded fibrinolysis may be due to either an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitors or decrease of plasminogen activators. Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of plasminogen may also lead to a thrombotic tendency.","['Aoki, N']",['Aoki N'],"['First Department of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Antifibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fibrinolysis/*drug effects', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/*drug therapy', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Thrombosis/drug therapy']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(89)90021-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(89)90021-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1989 Mar;3(1):11-7. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(89)90021-0.,43,,['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, one of the regulatory factors, tax protein, activates not only viral transcription from the LTR but also transcription of genes coding IL-2 and IL-2 receptor and eventually supposed to induce proliferation of infected T cells. However, expression of tax protein is regulated negatively by another viral regulatory factor, rex protein, in a novel fashion. The process of ATL development is discussed in relation to the regulation of viral gene expression.","['Seiki, M']",['Seiki M'],"['Dept. of Viral Oncology, Cancer Research Institute Kanazawa University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In both cell lines DNA synthesis was inhibited and in the U-937 cells this was accompanied by the appearance of macrophage differentiation markers. The erythroid characteristics of K-562 cells, on the other hand, were markedly suppressed. Intracellular pH (pHi) was increased by TPA treatment; however, while the alkalinization of K-562 cells was dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+, the response of U-937 cells was unaffected by the removal of this cation. In each cell type the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor H-7 largely attenuated the TPA induced increase of pHi. Moreover, the alpha-stereoisomer of TPA, which does not activate PKC, had no effects. TPA caused a dose-dependent decrease in Ca2+i which was more pronounced in U-937 cells. Measurements of membrane potential revealed a marked TPA depolarization of the K-562 cells, but no such effects were observed in the U-937 cell line. The depolarizing response of K-562 cells could be abolished by substituting extracellular Na+ with choline+, indicating the presence of a TPA sensitive Na+ permeability. The results show that the phorbol ester TPA, which inhibits proliferation and causes phenotypic modulation, also induced a number of early, apparently PKC dependent and cell type specific, changes of intracellular ion activities. The possible role of intracellular ion fluxes in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation is discussed.","['Larsson, R', 'Nygren, P', 'Forsbeck, K', 'Gylfe, E', 'Nilsson, K']","['Larsson R', 'Nygren P', 'Forsbeck K', 'Gylfe E', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jan-Feb;9(1):1-7.,,,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CR rate is nearly 43% (AML) and 66% (ALL), respectively, shows a dependence upon age and is impaired above all by a high early death rate (supportive therapy).

When this virus was introduced into newborn mice, it reproducibly generated fibrosarcomas at the site of inoculation. Proviruses in each fibrosarcoma analyzed had lost 149 nucleotides downstream of the PDGF-B coding region. This deletion originated from an alternative or aberrant splice event that occurred within exon 7 of the PDGF-B gene and mimicked the v-sis oncogene. Thus, deletion of this region may be necessary for efficient retrovirus replication or for more potent transforming function. Evidence that the normal growth factor coding sequence was unaltered derived from RNase protection studies and immunoprecipitation analysis. Tumors were generally polyclonal but demonstrated clonal subpopulations. Moreover, tumor-derived cell lines became monoclonal within a few tissue culture passages and rapidly formed tumors in vivo. These findings argue that overexpression of the normal human PDGF-B gene product under retrovirus control can induce the fully malignant phenotype.","['Pech, M', 'Gazit, A', 'Arnstein, P', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Pech M', 'Gazit A', 'Arnstein P', 'Aaronson SA']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*genetics']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.8.2693 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Apr;86(8):2693-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.8.2693.,,,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",,PMC286984,,['GENBANK/M26180'],,,,,,,,,

These mutations result in several amino acid differences in the encoded proteins. We have used recombinant murine retroviruses containing various myc alleles to analyse the myelomonocytic transforming potential of the myc oncogene. The myc alleles used were MC29 v-myc, chicken c-myc, chimeric genes combining 5' sections of v- or c-myc with 3' sections of c- or v-myc, and mouse c-myc. The same retroviral vector (based on the genome of Moloney leukemia virus) was used for each allele and the genes were translated from genomic message. By infecting the primary mouse tissues, bone marrow, peritoneal-derived macrophages and mixed embryonic tissue with the recombinant viruses, variation was found in the transforming efficacy of these alleles: v-myc was most effective, followed by the two chimeric genes, whereas c-myc (chicken or mouse) was least effective in eliciting myelomonocytic transformation. Viral gag sequences were not necessary for this transformation. In each case, the transformed monocytes were growth factor-dependent and non-immortal. However, v-myc transformed monocytes (though not monocytes transformed by other myc alleles) were able to progress to an immortal, growth factor-independent phenotype. Our results indicate that v-myc is far more effective than c-myc in eliciting myelomonocytic transformation; that this is due to combinatorial effects of 5' and 3' mutations in the v-myc gene; and that secondary events in addition to these mutations are required for transformation of myelomonocytic cells to an immortal, tumorigenic phenotype.","['Symonds, G', 'Hartshorn, A', 'Kennewell, A', ""O'Mara, M A"", 'Bruskin, A', 'Bishop, J M']","['Symonds G', 'Hartshorn A', 'Kennewell A', ""O'Mara MA"", 'Bruskin A', 'Bishop JM']","[""Children's Medical Research Foundation, Camperdown, N.S.W., Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Oncogene Protein p55(v-myc)', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Mar;4(3):285-94.,,,"['0 (Oncogene Protein p55(v-myc))', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis was based on morphological and cytochemical analyses, and the leukaemias were classified by FAB criteria. A considerable difference was observed between the results of bone marrow aspirates and the findings of plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens, particularly in marrow cellularity, extent of blast cell infiltration, and cell type involved in the leukaemic process. The myelomonocytic cell type seemed to predominate in the sections. In four cases there was considerable marrow infiltration with maturing, but dysplastic, granulocytic cells in the sections, but not in the aspirate smears. Features of potential prognostic importance, such as bone marrow infiltration with inflammatory cells, were easily recognised and quantified in the sections. These results indicate that plastic embedded bone marrow biopsy sections complement the findings of bone marrow aspiration in the diagnosis of AML and may also provide information of independent prognostic importance that cannot be obtained by other means.","['Islam, A', 'Frisch, B', 'Henderson, E S']","['Islam A', 'Frisch B', 'Henderson ES']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle/*methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylmethacrylates']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.42.3.300 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1989 Mar;42(3):300-6. doi: 10.1136/jcp.42.3.300.,,,['0 (Methylmethacrylates)'],,PMC1141873,,,,,,,,,,,

Marrow aspirate specimens were obtained for these studies from cyclic neutropenia patients (both during neutropenic nadirs and during recovery phases of cycles), from leukemia patients in remission who had received myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and from healthy normal volunteers. Nucleated marrow cells were then isolated by density-gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved to permit studies of CFU-GM from patients and controls to be carried out at the same time and in replicate. Maximum clonal growth of CFU-GM from normal subjects and from individuals recovering from drug-induced myelosuppression was elicited by 20-100 pmol/liter rhGM-CSF, and the CSF concentrations that induced half-maximal responses (ED50) were between 1.0 and 3.0 pmol/liter. In contrast, maximum growth of CFU-GM from the cyclic neutropenia patients required greater than or equal to 1.0 nmol/liter rhGM-CSF and ED50's were greater than 30.0 pmol/liter. These abnormalities in the GM-CSF responsive growth of myeloid progenitors were independent of cycle time and were most apparent with the predominantly neutrophilic 7-d CFU-GM. Moreover, differences in the growth of 14-d CFU-GM could be attributed mostly if not entirely to differences in the generation of neutrophilic colonies. These findings indicate that childhood onset cyclic neutropenia is associated with an underlying disturbance in the GM-CSF responsive growth of myeloid progenitors committed to neutrophilic differentiation.","['Wright, D G', 'LaRussa, V F', 'Salvado, A J', 'Knight, R D']","['Wright DG', 'LaRussa VF', 'Salvado AJ', 'Knight RD']","['Department of Hematology, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, DC 20307-5100.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*pathology', '*Periodicity', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114031 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Apr;83(4):1414-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI114031.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,PMC303837,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, SS-A/Ro has been shown to be composed of at least two polypeptide antigens of 60 and 52 kD noncovalently associated with a set of small RNAs, designated Y1-Y5. A serum from an SS patient was selected to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from human T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4) mRNA. An immunoreactive clone was isolated that possessed a 1.8-kb cDNA insert. In vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA resulted in the synthesis of a 57.5-kD polypeptide which was specifically immunoprecipitated by SS-A/Ro antisera. The identity of the cDNA encoded protein as the 60-kD SS-A/Ro antigen was established by proteolytic peptide mapping of the cDNA-encoded protein and the 60-kD HeLa cell antigen. The sequence of the cDNA shows that the 60-kD SS-A/Ro protein possesses both RNA binding protein consensus sequences and a single zinc-finger motif. Recombinant SS-A/Ro antigen produced in bacteria proved to be a sensitive and specific reagent for detection of anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies in patient sera.

We have compared the ability of these drugs to cause point mutations in bacteria, 'petite' mutations in yeast and mutations in mammalian cells. Several of the compounds are frameshift mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 while some cause 'petite' mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All are highly clastogenic and have significant mutagenic activity at the 6-thioguanine locus in cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts following 1 h drug exposures. None are mutagenic at the ouabain locus of these cells. The relationship between different indicators of mutagenicity has been studied using an additional set of amsacrine analogues, some of which are mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA98. There is a highly significant relationship between mutation frequency (measured as resistance to 6-thioguanine) and either cytotoxicity (D37 values in a clonogenic assay) or clastogenicity (ability to induce micronuclei). However, there is no correlation with mutagenicity in microbial systems.

Results of a pilot study.,1975-8,"Chemotherapeutic regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) include a remission induction period with high, daily doses of prednisone among other agents. A period of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis follows, during which steroids are often tapered entirely before cranial radiation (CRT) is completed or even initiated. The somnolence syndrome (SS) has been described 4 to 6 weeks after completion of CRT in up to 60% of the children with doses as low as 1800 cGy. A pilot study of continuous steroid coverage during CRT in childhood ALL was conducted. From July 1984 to July 1986, 38 children entered on Children's Cancer Study Group ALL protocols received CRT of 1800 cGy (180 cGy x 10). All patients received oral prednisone throughout the entire course of CRT at daily doses varying from 3.0 to 60.0 mg/m2. The overall incidence of the SS was 13% (five patients). The development of the syndrome was steroid dose-dependent: greater than or equal to 15 mg/m2/d (one of 32 patients), 3% incidence; less than 15 mg/m2 (four of six patients), 67% incidence. The presence of headache during CRT was also steroid dose-related: greater than or equal to 15 mg/m2, one of 32 patients; less than 15 mg/m2, six of six patients. Of the seven patients with headache during CRT, five developed the SS. The two patients (both of the less than 15 mg/m2 group) who did not develop the SS were the only cases treated with increased steroid doses at the onset of headache symptoms. Steroid coverage at a dose of greater than or equal to 15 mg/m2 during CRT appears to significantly reduce the incidence of acute radiation reactions and the SS.

An epidemiologic investigation implicating marijuana (a report from the Childrens Cancer Study Group).,1904-11,"The Childrens Cancer Study Group conducted a case-control study designed to assess in utero and postnatal exposures in children with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). Analyses were performed for reported maternal use of medications and drugs in the year preceding and during the index pregnancy of the 204 case-control pairs. An 11-fold risk (P = 0.003) was found for maternal use of mind-altering drugs just prior to or during the index pregnancy. Compared with ANLL cases not exposed to marijuana, exposed cases were significantly younger at diagnosis of ANLL (P less than 0.01) and were more often of the myelomonocytic and monocytic subtypes (P less than 0.01). Use of antinausea medication for more than 11 weeks was also associated with a significantly elevated relative risk of 2.81 and a dose-response relationship was noted (P = 0.05 for trend). These results suggest that maternal drug use of marijuana may have an etiologic role in childhood ANLL and may be specific for morphologically defined subgroups.","['Robison, L L', 'Buckley, J D', 'Daigle, A E', 'Wells, R', 'Benjamin, D', 'Arthur, D C', 'Hammond, G D']","['Robison LL', 'Buckley JD', 'Daigle AE', 'Wells R', 'Benjamin D', 'Arthur DC', 'Hammond GD']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antiemetics/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dicyclomine', 'Doxylamine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', '*Marijuana Smoking', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/administration & dosage', '*Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Pyridoxine/administration & dosage']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer. 1989 May 15;63(10):1904-11.,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antiemetics)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (dicyclomine, doxylamine, pyridoxine drug combination)', '4KV4X8IF6V (Dicyclomine)', '95QB77JKPL (Doxylamine)', 'KV2JZ1BI6Z (Pyridoxine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cases, their use can be misleading. Here we report and discuss some examples. A platelet peroxidase (PPO) activity is detected in most cases of early erythroid leukemias as well as in the CFU-E-like cells of normal marrow, thus providing evidence that PPO activity must be studied along with other (immunologic or ultrastructural) markers to permit a reliable diagnosis of megakaryoblastic leukemia. Ferritin molecules an erythroid marker, could be detected as a cluster at ultrastructural level in leukemic platelets and in micromegakaryocytes of one patient. However, in blasts of the erythroid lineage, ferritin molecules are also either dispersed in the cytoplasm or localized in theta granules. Immunologic markers have also their own limit. Indeed, in one patient, GB IIb and IIIa were detected on erythroid blasts, resulting in a phenotype very similar to HEL cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) I, an early erythroid marker, was detected in the platelets of four leukemic patients and was present along with an increased expression of CA II. This study emphasizes the fact that precise diagnosis of leukemia cannot be performed with a single marker of differentiation, but requires the simultaneous use of several lineage restricted markers.","['Breton-Gorius, J', 'Villeval, J L', 'Kieffer, N', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Guichard, J', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Breton-Gorius J', 'Villeval JL', 'Kieffer N', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Guichard J', 'Vainchenker W']","['Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['Antibodies', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Ferritins/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/blood/*diagnosis', 'Megakaryocytes/ultrastructure', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1989;15(1):259-77.,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with elevated Mk-CSA levels had less CFU-Mk in their bone marrow than did patients with a normal or decreased Mk-CSA (p less than 0.01). Animal experiments using murine models have documented that several purified molecules including erythropoietin, multi-CSF and GM-CSF possess Mk-CSA. The in vitro Mk-CSF of WEHI-3-conditioned medium is multi-CSF. The in vivo significance for megakaryocytopoiesis of these factors is not clear. In the human system, Mk-CSA is increased in conditions with decreased bone marrow megakaryocytes. Recombinant human or primate CSFs have in vitro Mk-CSA utilizing both human and murine cells as targets. However, the presence of these activities does not fully explain the Mk-CSA in human serum rich in Mk-CSA. The precise regulation of human blood cell levels and the studies discussed suggest that there is a specific Mk-CSF that responds to in vivo changes in megakaryocyte numbers.

No effects of the T-cell depletion could be seen on the recovery of myeloid or lymphoid cells as measured by the day to engraftment or by the absolute number of cells through day 100. Normal numbers of lytically active natural killer cells returned the earliest and were rapidly followed in both groups of patients by the appearance of circulating B cells and normalization of the responses to B-cell mitogens. However, the recovery of normal T-cell proliferative responses were more delayed in recipients of T-cell depleted grafts. Significant quantitative differences were seen only during the first 3 months after transplantation. Neither the number of CD3+ T cells nor the ratio of CD4:CD8 positive cells differed markedly between the two transplant groups. Mitogen-induced immunoglobulin production by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients following T-cell depleted BMT was quantitatively less than that of conventional marrow recipients through the first year, with low normal IgM production reached by 4 to 6 months in both groups. IgG production reached low normal 7 to 9 months after conventional BMT but did not remain at this level until 1 year following either type of transplant. Assessment of the incidence of infections from the day the absolute neutrophil count reached 500 until day 180 after transplant revealed no significant differences between the two groups; indeed, the overall nonleukemic mortality was higher in the recipients of conventional bone marrow. Thus, in our series, the removal of mature cells from the marrow graft did not affect the rate or degree of recovery of myeloid and lymphoid cells but did affect the regeneration of in vitro T-cell dependent functions. We noted early quantitative differences and a delay in the normalization of the T-cell functions measured rather than prolonged absolute deficiencies. The in vitro deficiencies did not result in significant clinically apparent differences between the two groups.","['Keever, C A', 'Small, T N', 'Flomenberg, N', 'Heller, G', 'Pekle, K', 'Black, P', 'Pecora, A', 'Gillio, A', 'Kernan, N A', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Keever CA', 'Small TN', 'Flomenberg N', 'Heller G', 'Pekle K', 'Black P', 'Pecora A', 'Gillio A', 'Kernan NA', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Infections/etiology/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocytes/classification/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Pokeweed Mitogens', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/mortality', 'Postoperative Period', 'Staphylococcal Protein A', '*T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75563-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Apr;73(5):1340-50.,,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former comprises cases with Ph1 + marrow cells and Ph1 + erythroid and (or) myeloid colonies in remission marrow and others in which the t(9;22) is undetectable in remission marrow cells. In the latter subgroup, the disease may reflect more extreme mosaicism with a similar stem cell that is cytogenetically undetectable. Variant karyotypes included a del(22)(q11) in one patient and a t(6;22;15;9) (q21;q11;q?22;q21) in another; in both instances, the malignant blast cells lacked P185BCR-ABL expression. Thus ALL with t(9;22)(q34;q11) should be distinguished from ALL with other involvement of the 22q11 breakpoint by molecular studies including protein expression.

In normal bone marrow immature MK, TSP, and vWF were observed in the Golgi-associated vesicles and in small immature alpha-granules; in mature MK, they were found in the matrix of the mature large alpha-granules. Surprisingly, Fg was detected neither in the Golgi area, nor in the small precursors of alpha-granules; it was only found in the mature alpha-granules but this labeling was generally weaker than in blood platelets. In order to confirm these differences between the expression of Fg and vWF or TSP additional studies were performed on cultured maturing MK: immunofluorescent and ultrastructural immunogold labeling confirmed that vWF appeared early in the maturation while the same immature MK were negative for Fg. In the late maturation stage, the three proteins were detected in the alpha-granules. In order to know whether Fg was lately synthesized or endocytosed from the outside medium, normal MK were grown in the presence of either normal or afibrinogenemic plasma, and normal serum. Fg was detected only in the alpha-granules of MK grown in normal plasma. Similar results were observed with malignant MK, whose maturation was independent of the culture conditions. In conclusion, this study brings immunocytochemical evidence that vWF and TSP are synthesized by immature MK, whereas Fg appears later in the MK alpha-granules and its expression is dependent of the presence of an exogenous Fg source.","['Cramer, E M', 'Debili, N', 'Martin, J F', 'Gladwin, A M', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Harrison, P', 'Savidge, G F', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Cramer EM', 'Debili N', 'Martin JF', 'Gladwin AM', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Harrison P', 'Savidge GF', 'Vainchenker W']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, C.H.U.

Median overall survival was 21.7 months, with a projection that 29.4% of the patients will survive more than 55 months.

Only 12 patients (2.2%) were lost to follow-up, while therapy was interrupted in 7 (2%) because of side effects and in 12 (3.3%) because of the patient's refusal. By multivariate analysis increasing age and presence of infection at diagnosis were associated with a lower remission rate; risk of relapse was greater in L2 subtypes and in patients with higher WBC at diagnosis; survival was inversely correlated to age. The high response rate was not achieved at expense of an increased risk of induction death. The low incidence of isolated CNS relapse (8.0% of responding patients) suggests that CNS prophylaxis as used in this study is effective.

IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF and M-CSF elevated the proportions of monocyte/macrophages in 3/25, 2/25, 1/25 and 6/25 cases respectively, and increased the percentages of mature granulocytes in 2/25, 1/25, 1/25 and 0/25 cases, and if so only to a limited extent (values below 50%). The 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake studies revealed that IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF and M-CSF were efficient stimulators of DNA synthesis of AML cells in 19, 15, 13 and four of those cases, respectively. Thus, although the cells in most cases responded to CSFs by activation of DNA synthesis, they were unable to give rise to terminally differentiated stages. Provision of CSFs in combination was more frequently effective in enhancing maturation and also increased the magnitude of maturation response. Monocytic versus granulocytic maturation of AML cells after culture did not correlate with the FAB cytology nor with the type of CSF presented; but generally granulocytic maturation was an infrequent phenomenon. Epo stimulated erythroid differentiation and DNA synthesis only in the case of erythroleukaemia, but it had no effect on the cells of 10 other AML cases. Extrapolation of these in vitro findings would suggest that CSFs would have a limited therapeutic utility to induce AML cell maturation in vivo and that hazards of stimulating blast cell proliferation with these factors may be anticipated.","['Salem, M', 'Delwel, R', 'Mahmoud, L A', 'Clark, S', 'Elbasousy, E M', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Salem M', 'Delwel R', 'Mahmoud LA', 'Clark S', 'Elbasousy EM', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocytes', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Macrophages', 'Monocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb04293.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Mar;71(3):363-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb04293.x.,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemia patients the changes in the number of leukemic and normal cells are easily quantitatively evaluated. The criteria depends on the reduction and recovery of leukemic cells and normal cells. In acute leukemia because considerable parts of complete remissions ended with relapse, the evaluation seems necessarily to differentiate good remission from standard remission. For such purpose 5,000 leukocyte differential seemed effective. In the phase II study of anti-leukemia drugs, however, it seemed necessary to find efficacy less than remission, to avoid underestimation of drug efficacy because pretreated patients are usually studied in the phase II study. In the evaluation of chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or polycythemia vera, short term judgment needs to be further studied about the correlation with longterm efficacy such as survival. The treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome is very hard to evaluate, reduction of blasts and increase of normal cells may be necessary for the improvement of symptoms.

This cDNA as well as a 5.6-kilobase normal human genomic DNA fragment containing the c-jun gene were placed under the control of retroviral long terminal repeats and introduced into primary rat embryo cells (RECs), with or without other oncogenes, and into an immortal rat fibroblast cell line, Rat-1a, as a single gene. In Rat-1a cells the expression of human c-jun mRNA was associated with the ability to clone in soft agarose and form tumors in nude mice. When the c-jun cDNA or genomic DNA constructs were introduced into RECs, no foci of transformed cells were seen with c-jun alone or c-jun cotransfected with deregulated c-myc or L-myc protooncogenes. However, cotransfection of the c-jun constructs with an activated human c-Ha-ras gene led to foci of transformed cells which gave rise to immortalized cell lines that cloned in soft agarose and formed tumors in nude mice. Furthermore, formation of foci of transformed RECs by the c-jun/ras combination was augmented 3-fold by the tumor promoter phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate.

This allows to propose a new model, still to be confirmed, of recombination after formation of two hairpin structures which could facilitate the genesis of the chromosomal accident.","['Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z', ""d'Auriol, L"", 'Le Coniat, M', 'Grausz, D', 'Berger, R']","['Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', ""d'Auriol L"", 'Le Coniat M', 'Grausz D', 'Berger R']","['Unite INSERM U301, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Feb;4(2):195-202.,,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,"['GENBANK/X13921', 'GENBANK/X13922']",,,,,,,,,

Several studies have demonstrated rapid down-regulation of the steady-state levels of c-myc RNA during DMSO induced differentiation of the human 'promyelocytic' cell line, HL-60. However, little is known about the effect of DMSO on c-myc regulation in cells which are not induced to differentiate by DMSO. We have examined the effect of DMSO on c-myc RNA levels in a number of cell lines with different lesions in the c-myc gene, including those which do not differentiate in response to DMSO treatment. Here we demonstrate that DMSO induces a rapid, but transient, reduction in the steady-state level of c-myc RNA in human 'erythroid' K562 cells, Burkitt lymphoma lines Daudi and Raji, human T cell lymphoblastoid line CEM and mouse lymphoma line L1210. However, DMSO treatment does not produce a similar effect in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 320 or HeLa epithelial cervical carcinoma cells. These observations demonstrate that the DMSO induced modulation of c-myc RNA levels is a more common phenomenon than previously recognised, and is not necessarily correlated with either the induction of cellular differentiation or growth arrest.","['Darling, D', 'Tavassoli, M', 'Linskens, M H', 'Farzaneh, F']","['Darling D', 'Tavassoli M', 'Linskens MH', 'Farzaneh F']","[""Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Feb;4(2):175-9.,,,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The c-myc protein paralleled c-myc mRNA throughout induction. The p53 mRNA and protein behaved in a discordant fashion. The p53 protein decreased to very low levels between 4 and 8 h and remained low, while the mRNA, which initially decreased, reaccumulated by 24 and 48 h. Transfer of MELC after 12 to 48 h of culture with HMBA to medium without inducer resulted in rapid (less than 3 h) reaccumulation of the c-myb mRNA, c-myb protein, and p53 protein, and cessation of recruitment of cells to commitment.

In both instances a chimeric gene, formed between bcr and the abl protooncogene, results in expression of fused bcr-abl proteins with tyrosine kinase activity. There is controversy regarding the normal gene products of bcr. We investigated this problem by several techniques and found proteins of 190/185, 155, 135, 125, 108, 83 and 47 kDa in several human cell lines by immunoprecipitation with two distinct site-directed anti-bcr antibodies termed anti-bcr(738-753) and anti-bcr(898-911). The 190/185, 155, 125 and 108 kDa proteins were consistently detected by anti-bcr(898-911) antibodies by immunoblotting. Antibodies pre-reacted with excess bcr peptide did not detect these proteins. These proteins were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo and in vitro by [gamma 32P]ATP in immune complex kinase assays performed with anti-bcr antibodies indicating that these proteins are phosphorproteins. Following labeling in kinase assays, phosphoamino acid analyses detected both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. In structural studies using one dimensional peptide maps derived by partial V8 protease treatment, the 185, 155, 135, 125 and 108 kDa proteins shared several peptide fragments but contained unique fragments as well. Similarly 2-dimensional maps of proteins labeled in the kinase assay exhaustively digested with trypsin, revealed homology between the 155, 135, 125, 108, and 83 kDa proteins. bcr proteins sedimented in glycerol gradients as putative complexes detected in the cytoplasm of the cell. A 47 kDa protein as well as the recently identified Ph-P53 protein appeared to be associated with bcr proteins based on their co-sedimentation in glycerol gradients and co-immunoprecipitation with several different anti-bcr antibodies. None of the proteins exhibited a precursor-product relationship in pulse-chase experiments conducted with [35S]methionine. We conclude that human cells express several different bcr gene products ranging in size from 190 to 83 kDa, and that these proteins can form specific intracellular cytoplasmic complexes with other cellular proteins.","['Li, W J', 'Dreazen, O', 'Kloetzer, W', 'Gale, R P', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Li WJ', 'Dreazen O', 'Kloetzer W', 'Gale RP', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic System/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Feb;4(2):127-38.,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47372/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study this effect (called adoptive immunotherapy) we modified the prophylaxis of GVHD in patients with advanced hematologic neoplasms (mostly leukemia) who received bone marrow transplants. Patients under 30 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three regimens of post-transplantation immunosuppression: Group I (n = 44) received a standard course of methotrexate for 102 days after transplantation, Group II (n = 40) received an abbreviated (11-day) course of methotrexate, and Group III (n = 25) received the standard course of methotrexate plus viable buffy-coat cells from the marrow donors. All 109 patients received cyclophosphamide (60 mg per kilogram of body weight on each of two days), total-body irradiation (2.25 Gy daily for seven days), and unmodified marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors. The frequency of GVHD of Grades II through IV was 25 percent in Group I, 59 percent in Group II, and 82 percent in Group III (P = 0.0001). The incidence of chronic GVHD, however, did not differ significantly among the groups (33, 51, and 44 percent, respectively), nor did the five-year probability of recurrence of disease (38, 45, and 33 percent, respectively). However, mortality from causes other than cancer was 34 percent in Group I, 45 percent in Group II, and 64 percent in Group III (I vs. III, P = 0.024); the deaths were due primarily to infections complicating the course of GVHD. With a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 3.9 to 7.4), disease-free survival was 41 percent in Group I, 30 percent in Group II, and 24 percent in Group III (the differences were not statistically significant).

Competitive binding of 125I-MDNCF to human neutrophils reached a maximal level at 1-3 h at 4 degrees C.

Comparable effects are seen upon treatment of HL-60 cells with dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO), which is also known to induce granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Hence, the effects of antisense oligomers on cellular differentiation were examined and compared with Me2SO. Differentiation of HL-60 cells into forms with granulocytic characteristics was found to be enhanced in a sequence-specific manner by the anti-c-myc oligomer. No synergism was observed between the anti-c-myc oligomer and Me2SO in stimulating cellular differentiation. In contrast, synergism did appear in the inhibition of cell proliferation.

As a result of the ability of certain chemicals such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to induce terminal erythroid differentiation, the cells have been used as a model for understanding the molecular basis of cellular differentiation. Recent work on MEL cells as well as other differentiating systems indicates that expression of cellular protooncogenes is implicated in chemically mediated differentiation. In MEL cells the expression of the c-myc protooncogene undergoes unusual biphasic changes following inducer treatment. Levels of c-myc mRNA decrease 10- to 20-fold between 1 and 2 hr and are then reexpressed between 12 and 24 hr. These changes occur as a result of complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory events. Recent DNA transfection experiments, in which MEL cells were transfected with myc expression vectors, indicate that both the early decrease in c-myc expression and its subsequent reexpression are important events in the differentiation pathway. The work on MEL cells, as well as on other models of differentiation, is directed at understanding the molecular basis of leukemogenic transformation and cellular differentiation. The ability of c-myc, as well as other protooncogenes, to influence both of these events indicates that cellular protooncogenes play a central role in their regulation.","['Lachman, H M']",['Lachman HM'],"['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8980161 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Mar;80:161-72. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8980161.,93,['CA4324601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC1567612,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 3 months later, she presented with massive painful leukemic infiltration of the breasts as initial manifestation of relapse, followed by systemic symptoms of leukemia. In vitro culture of the leukemic cells demonstrated characteristics of macrophage cell line. This case illustrates a unique sequence of events: spontaneous remission after the termination of pregnancy, which has profound hormonal alterations, and relapse in a very hormone-sensitive organ, the breast, a few months later when the hormonal milieu was resumed. This suggests hormonal dependence of her leukemic cells and potential for hormonal manipulation in a certain subset of human leukemia.","['Antunez de Mayolo, J', 'Ahn, Y S', 'Temple, J D', 'Harrington, W J']","['Antunez de Mayolo J', 'Ahn YS', 'Temple JD', 'Harrington WJ']","[""Department of Medicine, Miami Veteran's Administration Hospital, Florida.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*physiopathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19890415)63:8<1621::aid-cncr2820630830>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Apr 15;63(8):1621-3. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890415)63:8<1621::aid-cncr2820630830>3.0.co;2-0.,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen of the remaining 15 (87%) in whom the response to therapy could be evaluated achieved complete remission. Two achieved good partial remissions. The median duration of complete remission and survival on study was 8 and 10 months, respectively. The four proven and three suspected fungal infections seen in the initial 19 patients was the major toxicity observed. The therapy was modified in the last 15 patients to retain efficacy while reducing the period of neutropenia from a median of 28 to 22 days.

The extent of myeloablative conditioning necessary for elimination of the non-malignant and premalignant clones is not known. We report our results of marrow transplantation with and without myeloablative conditioning in two patients with PNH and seven patients with MDS. Conditioning was not used in a patient with PNH and a monozygotic twin as donor. In this patient the disease remained unchanged. Myeloablative treatment with busulphan (BUS) in addition to immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (CY) was used for conditioning in a patient with PNH and a 2-year-old boy with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) and CY was used in six patients with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in leukaemic transformation (RAEB-T). Haematopoiesis was fully restored in all patients conditioned with myeloablative treatment except for a patient in leukaemic transformation with myelofibrosis and a HLA-DR-incompatible donor. Chimerism was complete in all patients except for the 2-year-old boy conditioned with BUS and CY.

Patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), however, did not show a faster rate of reconstitution of blood neutrophils. As well as being slower than patients with SAA for total leukocyte reconstitution, patients with CML were slower than patients with ANL and ALL in attaining a neutrophil count of 500 x 10(6)/l, and slower than patients with ANL in attaining a neutrophil count of 1000 x 10(6)/l. Patients given cyclosporin as the sole immunosuppressant prophylactic regimen post-transplant had faster reconstitution to total leukocyte counts of 500 and 1000 x 10(6)/l and to neutrophils of 1000 x 10(6)/l than patients given methotrexate alone, methotrexate and cyclosporin, or cyclosporin and T cell depletion of the donor marrow. No other factors (including the pretransplant preparative regimen) were significant in influencing the rate of leukocyte or neutrophil reconstitution.

Thirteen AML cases (18 per cent) were considered TdT+ by EIA. According to the FAB classification, almost all of them (12 out of 13) were within the M1 and M2 subgroups. A mixed lymphoid-myeloid phenotype was observed in one of the 13 TdT+ cases, while in none of the others were lymphoid features detected. Nine of the 10 EIA TdT+ cases studied in parallel were TdT positive with the conventional immunofluorescence assay. All patients received standard protocol chemotherapy and in 61 (13 TdT+, 48 TdT--) the response to induction treatment was analysable. Only 3/13 TdT+ patients (23 per cent) achieved a complete remission (CR), while in the TdT- group 38 patients had a CR (79 per cent) and 10 were resistant (p less than 0.01).

Although the relationship of venoocclusive disease to these agents has been well established, another process, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, may also occur. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the incidence and clinical signs of these two processes as defined by histological criteria. In 103 patients studied, nine (8.8%) had venoocclusive disease and 23 (22.5%) had nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Venoocclusive disease was significantly associated with transplantation for malignancy other than acute or chronic leukemia and use of busulfan as a cytoreductive agent and occurred in younger patients. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia did not differ from the general transplant population in terms of underlying disease, cytoreductive regimen, graft vs. host disease prophylaxis or age. Both venoocclusive disease and nodular regenerative hyperplasia were associated with ascites. Venoocclusive disease had a poor prognosis, with eight of nine cases dying of or with venoocclusive disease, whereas no case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia died of liver disease and only 5 of 23 died with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Using retrospective data, five of 11 patients fulfilling clinical criteria for the diagnosis of venoocclusive disease actually had nodular regenerative hyperplasia, as did all of nine patients fulfilling the criteria for ""possible"" venoocclusive disease. These results indicate that nodular regenerative hyperplasia is a process which occurs commonly following bone marrow transplantation and which may be clinically misdiagnosed as venoocclusive disease.","['Snover, D C', 'Weisdorf, S', 'Bloomer, J', 'McGlave, P', 'Weisdorf, D']","['Snover DC', 'Weisdorf S', 'Bloomer J', 'McGlave P', 'Weisdorf D']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Liver/*pathology/physiopathology', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0270913989000595 [pii]', '10.1002/hep.1840090317 [doi]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 1989 Mar;9(3):443-8. doi: 10.1002/hep.1840090317.,,['CA-P01-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the intrinsic defect is compatible with near normal haemopoietic function, as seen in autologous bone marrow reconstitution, it cannot be the cause of severe pancytopenia. On the other hand, immune mechanisms cannot be the primary cause of the disease, otherwise haemopoietic function would recover to complete normality after immunosuppressive therapy. From these observations we deduce that the intrinsic defect, a premalignant haemopoietic disorder, can either be clinically quiescent by virtue of repair mechanisms, or induce auto-reactivity of the immune system against the abnormal haemopoietic tissue, drugs, chemicals and viruses acting as non-specific triggers or amplifiers. In this sense, aplastic anaemia could be interpreted as an attempt to 'self-cure' from a variant type of preleukaemia. This means that the original concept of aplastic anaemia being a hypoplastic variant of leukaemia may be true. The fact that aplastic anaemia can present either as acute severe bone marrow failure, as chronic mild pancytopenia or as a myelodysplasia-like syndrome does not imply that the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are basically different. Variations of the clinical course and the response to immunosuppressive treatment could be explained by variations in the balance between the primary defect and the secondary immune reaction; the co-involvement of accessory cells in the primary disease; the relative time course of the two components and the efficiency of repair mechanisms. From repeated in vitro studies in a large group of aplastic anaemia patients at various stages of disease this concept can be applied to the majority of cases, including chloramphenicol- and virus-induced aplastic anaemia. In a small proportion of patients with pancytopenia occurring after exposure to certain drugs other than chloramphenicol, aplastic anaemia is rapidly and completely reversible after withdrawal of the drug. These patients probably have truly benign aplastic anaemia and thus differ from the majority of patients who are left with a permanently fragile bone marrow once they have acquired aplastic anaemia.","['Nissen-Druey, C']",['Nissen-Druey C'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(89)80006-x [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1989 Jan;2(1):37-49. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(89)80006-x.,72,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After one consolidation course, 248 patients were randomized for six courses of intensive maintenance: either repeated treatment with DNR-VCR-ara-C, or alternating treatment where amsacrine (AMSA) was combined with high dose ara-C on cycle 1,3, and 5 and with 5-azacytidine on cycle 2, 4, and 6. Ninety-nine patients were not randomized: 57 were introduced in a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) program, and 42 went off study, mainly for treatment toxicity or refusal. The main prognostic factors for achievement of CR were performance status, cytogenetics, and age, and for the disease-free survival (DFS): age and number of courses to CR. The rate of second remission was fairly high (64%) for patients relapsing off therapy. The DFS appeared identical (median, 53 weeks), in the two randomized arms, the alternating treatment not showing superiority to the repeated one, in spite of an increased toxicity. The median overall survival for patients achieving a CR was 90 weeks. The reason for the failure of alternating maintenance treatment to improve the DFS is probably related to an insufficient dose intensity: five patients who relapsed during maintenance arm B achieved a second CR with a more intensive combination of high-dose ara-C and AMSA. In addition, 60 patients underwent a BMT (43 allogeneic and 17 autologous). The DFS of patients treated with allogeneic BMT tended to be superior to the one obtained with the chemotherapy program. However the overall survival, as well as the event-free survival, seemed equivalent, including patients who relapsed before the planned BMT. Comparisons between allogeneic BMT, autologous BMT, and intensive consolidation during first CR deserve further prospective studies in AML.","['Zittoun, R', 'Jehn, U', 'Fiere, D', 'Haanen, C', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Willemze, R', 'Abels, J', 'Bury, J', 'Peetermans, M', 'Hayat, M']","['Zittoun R', 'Jehn U', 'Fiere D', 'Haanen C', 'Lowenberg B', 'Willemze R', 'Abels J', 'Bury J', 'Peetermans M', 'Hayat M', 'et al.']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Random Allocation', 'Remission Induction']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75583-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Mar;73(4):896-906.,,,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is rarely curative, splenectomy removes the site of the destruction or sequestration of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Destruction occurs in such diseases as hemolytic anemia and ITP, whereas sequestration occurs as an idiopathic disease or secondary to a host of other diseases described above. Splenectomy is also indicated for symptomatic splenomegaly associated with leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloproliferative disorders. It is palliative, increasing the comfort of the patient by removing a massive spleen. Splenectomy also serves as a staging tool in lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and NHL, although it is much more beneficial in Hodgkin's disease, owing simply to stage at presentation. Splenectomy can be performed safely with minimal risk in most patients, but certain diseases carry increased risks of fatality and complications. Such diseases include leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloproliferative disorders, but even in these, splenectomy may be indicated in a select group of patients. The decision to perform splenectomy should therefore be made individually in these cases. Because it can be palliative in some cases, splenectomy can play a role in patient management, even though it may not alter survival.","['Vevon, P A', 'Ellison, E C', 'Carey, L C']","['Vevon PA', 'Ellison EC', 'Carey LC']","['Department of Surgery, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Surg,Advances in surgery,0045335,IM,"['Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', 'Humans', '*Splenectomy']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Adv Surg. 1989;22:105-39.,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 160 cadaver kidney recipients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone there have been no lymphomas. Similarly in 14 living-related kidney recipients who were transplanted since the introduction of triple therapy for cadaver grafts, but continued to receive only azathioprine and prednisone, no lymphomas occurred. There seemed to be a clear relationship between this increase and the use of triple therapy. This led us to examine other possible contributing factors. A case control study has not shown any other factor that differs in patients in whom lymphomas developed. We have only been able to demonstrate Epstein Barr virus nuclear antigen in the cells of one tumor. Four of these 7 tumors were monoclonal, one polyclonal, and two indeterminate. All patients had their immunosuppression withdrawn and six received intravenous acyclovir. Three patients have shown some response but four patients died. Triple therapy is being used by many centers to reduce the level of cyclosporine toxicity.

In the BMT group, female sex, younger age, the absence of hepatitis during induction, a larger percentage of circulating blasts, and a shorter duration of symptoms were associated with longer survival, whereas only female sex and younger age favorably influenced disease-free survival (DFS). In the chemotherapy group, younger age, lower WBC at diagnosis, a single successful induction course, and the absence of circulating promyelocytes were associated with longer survival, whereas only a lower WBC and a lower percentage of peripheral neutrophils were associated with longer DFS. Estimated regression coefficients for treatment-by-prognostic-factor interactions were used to characterize subgroups of patients in which one treatment or the other produced better outcomes. BMT and chemotherapy produced similar durations of survival in a subset of patients characterized by many or all of the following: older age, male sex, achievement of complete remission (CR) after one induction, and absence of circulating blast cells at presentation. These data suggest that, using pretreatment variables, subgroups of patients can be identified for whom either BMT or continued chemotherapy is most likely to be beneficial.","['Tallman, M S', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Amos, D', 'Dahlberg, S', 'Hewlett, J S', 'Files, J C', 'Coltman, C A', 'Thomas, E D', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Tallman MS', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Amos D', 'Dahlberg S', 'Hewlett JS', 'Files JC', 'Coltman CA', 'Thomas ED', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.3.326 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Mar;7(3):326-37. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.3.326.,,"['AI 02425/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 880 patients entered on study, 827 (94%) achieved complete remission and 499 (56.7%) were in CCR after 3 years of maintenance therapy. Boys were required to have negative testicular biopsies before randomization. A total of 481 patients were eligible for the duration of therapy phase of the study. Of the 310 (64.4%) randomly assigned patients, 101 were entered on regimen A: discontinue therapy; 105 on regimen B: reinduction for 4 weeks, then discontinue therapy; and 104 on regimen C: continue maintenance therapy for 2 more years, then discontinue. After a median follow-up of over 72 months, no significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or survival were noted in the three regimens. At 6 years from randomization, 93.0%, 89.1%, and 89.1% of patients on regimens A, B, and C, respectively, remained in CCR. Isolated CNS or overt testicular relapses were not significantly different in any of the study regimens. Isolated testicular relapse after a negative biopsy occurred in only two of 137 randomized males (1.5%). DFS (P = .10) and survival (P = .83) were not significantly different for all boys and girls randomized to regimens A, B, or C. The relapse rate was higher in boys than in girls randomized to discontinue therapy (11% v 4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .14). Except for the presence of occult testicular leukemia (TL) in males, no other factors were identified that predicted for adverse events after 3 years of CCR.

Blast cells have also been found to secrete interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, and to express receptors for various growth factors as well. However, growth factors like interleukin 2 and interleukin 3 have not been identified as AML products, and several other factors including interleukin 4, interleukin 5, etc. need further evaluation. Responsiveness of clonogenic leukemic cells to exogenous growth-promoting factors in vitro suggests a possible role of these biomolecules in the course of these disorders. Important evidence for the crucial role of growth factors, at least in some subtypes of AML, has been provided by demonstrating constitutive growth factor production by leukemic cells and their autonomous in vitro growth which is dependent on autocrine secretion of a specific growth factor. The concert of mechanisms providing stimulatory and inhibitory signals for hematopoiesis, which is adapted to the various physiological requirements of the organism, may have multiple defects in AML. This leads to successive steps of malfunctioning of cells, which finally express a fully malignant phenotype. In addition, these derangements also lead to defects in accessory cells on the level of mediator communication. However, there is evidence for autonomous growth promotion of AML blast by constitutive production of growth factors active in an autocrine fashion (GM-CSF, G-CSF, interleukin 6) and by recruitment of accessory cells to increase CSF supply (GM-CSF, G-CSF) via molecules such as interleukin 1 and TNF-alpha in a paracrine fashion. Molecular analysis of transformed hematopoietic cells has revealed changes of the genome, e.g., insertion of viral genetic information or cytogenetic fractures at DNA sites controlling growth factor gene activation. These events appear to be crucial in the induction of uncontrolled growth factor expression promoting oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Oster, W', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Herrmann, F']","['Oster W', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Hematology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,IM,"['Colony-Stimulating Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530070104 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1989 Jan;7(1):13-29. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530070104.,116,,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our studies, which involved 25 autologous ALL recipients who received rhGM-CSF and 27 controls similar for disease status (remission or relapse) and disease type (B- or T-lineage) differed from previous studies in one important aspect: the bone marrows were purged with 4-hydroperoxcyclophosphamide (4HC) and anti-T or anti-B-cell lineage-specific antibodies before transplantation. Such treatments frequently lead to a reduction in the CFU-GM content of the transplanted marrow. Eighteen of 25 patients completed the entire course of rhGM-CSF. Of the 16 patients who received greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/M2/d for at least eight days, there were five patients who had an apparent rhGM-CSF response and 11 patients who did not respond.

Because these cell-line cells are susceptible to differentiation to either a more mature granulocytic or monocytic form, we were able to study the hypothesis that the combination of PCA and proteolytic activity is confined to the promyelocyte. This may explain the severe coagulopathy seen in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Cell differentiation in a myeloid direction induced by retinoic acid or DMSO led to a diminished PCA, while not affecting the fibrinolytic activity. On the other hand, monocytic differentiation obtained by culturing the cells in the presence of 1; 25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 led to the complete disappearance of the proteolytic activity of the cell lysate, although the procoagulant activity was still present. Furthermore, we found that the elastase activity almost disappeared after monocytic differentiation. We also studied the PCA, proteolytic activity, and elastase activity of blast cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Only in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia did we observe both a strong PCA and fibrinolytic activity. This supports our hypothesis that the combination of these activities is unique to the promyelocyte and may explain the observed bleeding complications in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Wijermans, P W', 'Rebel, V I', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['Wijermans PW', 'Rebel VI', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Huijgens PC', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Free University Hospital, Department of Haematology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Blood Coagulation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Pancreatic Elastase/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76265-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb 15;73(3):800-5.,,,"['EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These clones produce high levels of abnormally regulated proto-oncogene transcripts and fail to terminally differentiate in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. To determine the relative levels at which the two proto-oncogenes might exert their inhibitory effects, we asked whether these clones could express differentiated functions in the absence of terminal differentiation. It was found that exposure of c-myc-transfected cells to hemin allows for the induction of hemoglobin, whereas c-myb-transfected cells were refractory to hemin induction. It thus appears that c-myb exerts a more globally suppressive effect on F-MEL-differentiated functions than does c-myc and may prevent the expression of those events that can otherwise be dissociated from the terminally differentiated state.","['Prochownik, E V']",['Prochownik EV'],"['University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/genetics', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76262-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb 15;73(3):782-6.,,['HL33741/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bsp-1 staining correlated with toluidine blue-positive basophils in chronic phase CML and with toluidine blue-negative blast cells expressing an immature myeloid phenotype in blast crisis CML and AML. Chromosome in situ hybridization showed that the ABL oncogene was translocated from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 in the CML patients but remained on chromosome 9 in the AML patients.

We employed both immunohistochemical and flow cytometry methods including coplots and double labelling. Three types of myeloma cases were found: (1) those with isolated myeloid antigen coexpression, usually Leu M1 or esterase (BE, CE) positive (11 cases); (2) those with multiple myeloid antigens (Leu M1, M3, M5, MY7, BE, CE) (four cases); and (3) one case beginning as 1 and ending as 2. Isolated myeloid antigen expression was generally associated with typical features of myeloma with survival close to the anticipated median (33 months), while multiple myeloid antigen expression was associated with more aggressive disease and shorter survival duration (median survival 16 months). The latter subgroup also had other poor prognostic factors including high labelling index and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) positivity. Other features found overall were frequent abnormal karyotypes (seven of 12 abnormal) and coexpressed IgA (eight of 16); all IgA+ cases also coexpressed Leu M1. We conclude that there is an unusual and unexpected predilection for coexpression of myelomonocytic antigens in myeloma cells. The reasons are not immediately obvious. Whether the coexpression indicates that myeloma cells truly have latent multilineage potential or just aberrantly coexpress other hematopoietic antigens as a manifestation of malignancy remains to be explained.

The specific binding of biosynthetically labeled 35S-recombinant (r) IL-3 to freshly obtained leukemic marrow blasts was initially investigated. In five of 12 BCP ALL cases, the binding of 35S-rIL-3 was markedly blocked by excess cold rIL-3, and the percentage of inhibitable binding ranged from 53% to 78% (mean +/- SE = 65% +/- 4%). In these cases, the cell-bound radioactivity ranged from 146 cpm/10(7) cells to 1,433 cpm/10(7) cells (mean +/- SE = 627 +/- 250 cpm/10(7) cells), indicating that 1 to 14 femtomole (mean +/- SE = 6 +/- 2 fms) of [35S]rIL-3/10(7) cells were specifically bound (= 60 to 840 molecules per cell). rIL-3 stimulated the proliferative activity of leukemic BCPs in a dose-dependent fashion without inducing differentiation, and the half-maximal stimulatory activity was observed at a concentration of 17 to 34 pmol/L. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-isolated virtually pure populations of CD10+CD19+ leukemic BCPs from two BCP ALL patients, as well as from two of five BCP ALL cell lines, showed a marked proliferative response to highly purified rIL-3, providing formal evidence that the observed IL-3 responses were not mediated by accessory cells. There was a high correlation between [35S]rIL-3 binding and proliferative response in colony assays, indicating that functional IL-3 receptors were detected in ligand binding assays. Scatchard plot analysis of the specific equilibrium binding data for IL-3-responsive leukemic BCPs from one BCP ALL patient and two BCP ALL cell lines yielded a straight linear regression line, indicating the existence of a single class of 60 to 210 high-affinity IL-3 binding sites/cell. The calculated apparent affinity constant (Ka) values ranged from 3.6 x 10(9) to 5.9 x 10(9) mol/L-1. Hence, the concentration of IL-3 required to produce 50% maximal receptor occupancy (Kd) was in the range of 168 to 280 pmol/L. These concentrations are approximately tenfold higher than those required to induce 50% maximal proliferative response from leukemic BCPs in colony assays, indicating that low receptor occupancy is sufficient for growth stimulation of leukemic BCPs by rIL-3. In comparison, less than 10 to 20 IL-3 molecules/cell were bound to IL-3 unresponsive leukemic BCPs even when the concentration of free-[35S]rIL-3 was as high as 2 nmol/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Uckun, F M', 'Gesner, T G', 'Song, C W', 'Myers, D E', 'Mufson, A']","['Uckun FM', 'Gesner TG', 'Song CW', 'Myers DE', 'Mufson A']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76304-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb;73(2):533-42.,,"['P01 CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA 42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-2 is a glycoprotein lymphokine (mw 15,000) produced naturally by mitogen or antigen stimulated T-lymphocytes. The activities of IL-2 include: enhancement of IL-2 receptor positive T-lymphocytes and a variety of other in vitro and in vivo alterations of T cell function. The IL-2 gene has been cloned from the Jurkat leukemia cell line and expressed by recombinant biotechnology in an E. coli vector. In vitro incubation of IL-2 with selected T-lymphocytes results in the formation of lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cells. Rosenberg and colleagues, in 1983, demonstrated that both exogenous IL-2 and LAK cells were needed in order to get maximum tumor regression in a murine model and later humans. Patients selected for IL-2/LAK cell therapy have clinical metastases or advanced unresectable cancers. Almost all patients treated demonstrate some toxic effects, including chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and hepatic dysfunction. Approximately 75 percent of the patients have profound hypotension and require intensive nursing care. A review of the literature indicates that tumor responsiveness will range from negligible (adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastases) to a 30+ percent response in renal cell carcinoma when complete and partial responders are totalled.

In contrast to T-lymphoma cells, in which the LTRs of T-lymphomagenic virus SL3-3 and Moloney murine leukemia virus are more active than those of other viruses, transcriptional activity in these mature, interleukin-2-dependent cells is not correlated with the specificity of viral leukemogenicity. Several approaches were used to investigate the molecular basis for LTR activity differences in lymphoma cells and mature cytotoxic T cells. Deletion analysis of the Moloney virus LTR showed that the direct repeats associated with enhancer activity have, at most, a slight effect on expression in CTLL-1 cells, whereas they stimulate expression six- to eightfold in T-lymphoma cells. This suggests that the mature T-cell line lacks one or more factors present in T-lymphoma cells that function to augment transcription from the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR. We also used recombinant viral LTRs to investigate the role of the enhancer core element of SL3-3 in CTLL-1 and CTLL-2 cells. A one-base-pair difference between the core sequences of SL3-3 and nonleukemogenic Akv virus, which is important for SL3-3 activity in T-lymphoma cells, had no effect in these cells. The inability to distinguish the single-base-pair difference in expression assays was correlated with the absence of binding of a cellular factor, S-CBF, to the SL3-3 enhancer core in extracts of CTLL-1 and CTLL-2 nuclei. These studies may have implications for identification of the target cells for viral leukemogenesis, as well as for tracing of changes in the transcriptional machinery during T-lymphocyte differentiation.","['LoSardo, J E', 'Cupelli, L A', 'Short, M K', 'Berman, J W', 'Lenz, J']","['LoSardo JE', 'Cupelli LA', 'Short MK', 'Berman JW', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Protein Binding', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.3.1087-1094.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Mar;63(3):1087-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.3.1087-1094.1989.,,"['CA09060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07491/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,PMC247802,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a phase I study of CBDCA in adult patients with relapsed acute leukemia. Therapy was administered as a five-day continuous infusion. The initial dose of 875 mg/m2 over five days was escalated in 15% increments to a final dose of 2,100 mg/m2 over five days. Twenty-eight patients received 35 induction courses of CBDCA, including two patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) following the first course, and received a second induction course at the time of relapse. Therapy was well tolerated. No grade 3 or 4 extramedullary toxicity was seen. Myelosuppression was regularly observed, with prolonged myelosuppression at 2,100 mg/m2 over five days being the indication to cease dose escalation. Eight of 28 patients (28.5%) responded to CBDCA therapy (six CR, two partial remission [PR]) or ten of 30 initial induction courses (33.3%).

The ontogeny of the leukemic cells, however, has not been resolved and remains an area of controversy. Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) developed by our laboratory were screened for specificity against the leukemic cell and normal hemocytes using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The method demonstrated that a new Mab ""4A9"" reacted both with leukemic cells and with a small subpopulation of normal circulating hemocytes (NSC). Mab 4A9 not only stained leukemic cells and NSC in peripheral hemolymph, but, more importantly, reacted specifically with another cell, the ""connective tissue cell"" (CTC) in clams with leukemia. The data presented in this paper show that Mab 4A9 stains a subset of normal circulating cells, leukemic cells, and the CTCs.

However, the effect of the last four reagents is reduced considerably in most elongated cells, and MAB LP34 stains the large, flat cells intensely.

Cell numbers usually fell and viability was not well maintained. Some degree of differentiation was observed in most cultures. Considering these observations, together with those derived from parallel studies of immature CML cells, the data suggest that AML cells are more dependent than CML cells on environmental conditions for the maintenance of cell viability and proliferation. This is especially the case for AML cells obtained at the time of initial diagnosis. On the other hand, AML cells and myeloid blastic crisis CML cells are similar with respect to their apparent greater ability to differentiate in vitro than in vivo. The addition of recombinant hemopoietins to the suspension cultures of AML cells is associated with either increased proliferation or differentiation but not both. The cells of different patients respond differently to the different hemopoietins and the different hemopoietins produce different affects in cultures of cells obtained from the same patient.","['Wang, Z', 'Gao, X Z', 'Preisler, H D']","['Wang Z', 'Gao XZ', 'Preisler HD']","['Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Department of Hematologic Oncology, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Blood Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830300206 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1989 Feb;30(2):82-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830300206.,,['CA 1285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study CT scans are studied before and up to 1 year after TBI. Average lung densities measured before TBI showed large variations among the individual patients. On follow-up scans, lung density decreases were measured for patients who did not develop lung complications. Significant lung density increases were measured in patients who subsequently had lung complications. These lung density increases were observed prior to the onset of respiratory complications and could be correlated with the clinical course of the patients, suggesting the possibility for the usage of CT lung densitometry to predict lung complications before the onset of clinical symptoms.","['el-Khatib, E E', 'Freeman, C R', 'Rybka, W B', 'Lehnert, S', 'Podgorsak, E B']","['el-Khatib EE', 'Freeman CR', 'Rybka WB', 'Lehnert S', 'Podgorsak EB']","['Biomedical Physics Department, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/*radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/therapy', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(89)90014-X [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(89)90014-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Jan;16(1):85-94. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(89)90014-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This group included 13 patients with peripheral neuroepithelioma (Askin's tumor), 11 patients with Ewing's sarcoma, 3 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, and 4 patients with undifferentiated sarcomas. Following complete work-up, 17 patients presented with localized disease and 14 patients presented with metastases. Patients received intensive combined modality treatment with combination chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, +/- actinomycin-D and DTIC) and high-dose conventionally fractionated radiation therapy to the primary (55-60 Gy) and non-pulmonary metastases (45-50 Gy). Radiation techniques used for the primary chest wall tumor varied with the clinical presentation. Patients achieving a complete response received either low-dose fractionated TBI (1.5 Gy/0.15 Gy fx/5 weeks) or high-dose TBI (8 Gy/4 Gy fx/2 days) and an intensive cycle of chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation. Twenty-five of 31 patients were judged to have a complete response (including 1 patient with complete resection). With minimum follow-up of 6 months and median follow-up of 36 months from completion of treatment, 14 patients remain disease-free with 2 additional patients alive in second remission after relapse. Patients with localized disease at presentation have improved disease-free survival and overall survival compared to patients with metastases at presentation. All 17 localized patients achieved a CR and 11 are NED compared to 8 of 14 metastatic patients achieving a CR and only 3 are NED. There have been 5 loco-regional recurrences with 3 ""in-field"" failures and 2 failures in the regional pleura. There were no treatment-related deaths and no clinically significant cases of pneumonitis. To date, 2 patients have significant treatment related morbidity, including 1 patient with scoliosis requiring surgery and 1 patient with acute leukemia developing 42 months after the start of therapy (presently in remission). We conclude that this intensive combined modality therapy results in a high CR rate and good local control with acceptable morbidity.

The best studied example is retinoblastoma where deletion or transcriptional inactivation of a specific gene is associated with the development of the tumor. When hereditary retinoblastoma patients are treated with radiation, the incidence of osteosarcoma within the treatment field is extremely high compared to other cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. These data, together with cytogenetic and molecular data on the development of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia secondary to radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment suggest that radiation-induced deletions of critical DNA sequences may be an important event in radiation carcinogenesis. Therefore, we propose that radiation-induced tumors may result from deletion of tissue specific regulatory genes.

The distress is provoked by environmental heat, exercise, and dependency; it is relieved by exposure to cold and elevation of the extremity. Primary and secondary forms of erythromelalgia exist. Secondary erythromelalgia has been linked to a wide variety of diseases, the most common of which are certain myeloproliferative disorders: polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. We describe, for the first time, a patient in whom chronic myelogenous leukemia was associated with the development of erythromelalgia, review the 60 cases in the world literature of erythromelalgia in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes, and compare the primary and secondary forms of the disease. Importantly, symptoms of erythromelalgia preceded the onset of a myeloproliferative disease by a median of 2 1/2 years. Therefore, all patients with erythromelalgia should be monitored with periodic blood cell counts. An abnormal hemoglobin level, white blood cell or platelet count, or immature cells in the differential count are not seen in idiopathic erythromelalgia and should alert the physician to the possibility of a more serious underlying disease process. Treatment of the myeloproliferative syndrome will sometimes alleviate the symptoms of erythromelalgia. Alternatively, a single daily dose of aspirin results in dramatic improvement in most patients with either primary or secondary erythromelalgia.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Cohen, P R']","['Kurzrock R', 'Cohen PR']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,IM,"['Erythromelalgia/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications', 'Middle Aged']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1989 Jan;149(1):105-9.,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each patient received marrow from a family member who shared one HLA haplotype with the patient but differed to a variable degree for the HLA-A, B, and D antigens of the haplotype not shared. These 269 patients were compared with 930 patients who received marrow from siblings with identical HLA genotypes. All patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by the infusion of unmodified donor marrow cells. The rate of graft failure was 12.3 percent among the recipients of marrow from a donor with only one identical haplotype, as compared with 2.0 percent among recipients of marrow from a sibling with the same HLA genotype (both haplotypes inherited from the same parents) (P less than 0.0001). The incidence of graft failure correlated with the degree of donor HLA incompatibility. Graft failure occurred in 3 of 43 transplants (7 percent) from donors who were phenotypically HLA-matched with their recipient (haplotypes similar, but not inherited from the same parents), in 11 of 121 donors (9 percent) incompatible for one HLA locus, in 18 of 86 (21 percent) incompatible for two loci, and in 1 of 19 (5 percent) incompatible for three loci (P = 0.028). In a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, independent risk factors associated with graft failure were donor incompatibility for HLA-B and D (relative risk = 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.5; P = 0.0004) and a positive crossmatch for anti-donor lymphocytotoxic antibody (relative risk = 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 2.8; P = 0.0038). Residual host lymphocytes were detected in 11 of 14 patients with graft failure, suggesting that the mechanism for graft failure could be host-mediated immune rejection. We conclude that donor HLA incompatibility and prior alloimmunization are significant risk factors for graft failure, and that a more effective immunosuppressive regimen than those currently used is needed for consistent achievement of sustained engraftment of marrow transplanted from donors who are not HLA-identical siblings.","['Anasetti, C', 'Amos, D', 'Beatty, P G', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Bensinger, W', 'Buckner, C D', 'Clift, R', 'Doney, K', 'Martin, P J', 'Mickelson, E']","['Anasetti C', 'Amos D', 'Beatty PG', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Bensinger W', 'Buckner CD', 'Clift R', 'Doney K', 'Martin PJ', 'Mickelson E', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', '*Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-D Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/01/26 00:00,1989/01/26 00:01,['1989/01/26 00:00'],"['1989/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198901263200401 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1989 Jan 26;320(4):197-204. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198901263200401.,,"['T32 CA009515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, almost all the lymphocytes including germinal center cells were positive for beta-enolase. Small lymphocytes in the mantle zones were negative, centrocytes were negative or weakly positive, the majority of centroblasts were strongly positive and the remaining were weakly positive for gamma-enolase. In all 5 patients with childhood non-T-ALL, leukemic lymphocytes were strongly positive only for alpha-enolase. In all 33 patients with B cell lymphoma, lymphoma cells were positive for beta-enolase. In many patients with follicular lymphoma, lymphoma cells were positive only for beta-enolase. Four of five patients with malignant lymphoma, diffuse, small cleaved cell, showed the reactivity of alpha-, beta+, gamma+-enolases in lymphoma cells.

We have hypothesized that such factors could also activate macrophage (M phi) tumor lysis and might be stored in the cytoplasmic granules. Granules were isolated from the RNK large granular lymphocyte leukemias by nitrogen cavitation and Percoll fractionation of the cell homogenate. Utilizing CSF-1 differentiated murine bone marrow-derived M phi and P815 tumor target cells, a M phi-activating factor (MAF) was found. The MAF activity was identified in two peaks, the first was coincident with dense granule enzymes and was 60 times more concentrated per mg protein than a second peak in the cytosol fractions. Solubilization in 2 M NaCl was necessary to recover activity from both peaks. Granule NK-MAF required the simultaneous presence of LPS in order to induce tumoricidal activity. Kinetics of NK-MAF activation peaked after 12 h of exposure. The NK-MAF was short lived in the solubilized granules; however, its heat resistance allowed us to prepare enriched and stable preparations. Treatment of NK-MAF with pepsin but not trypsin completely abrogated its activity. The NK-MAF passed through an ultrafiltration membrane with a nominal cut-off of 10 kDa. This work indicates that NK cell granules contain a small heat-stable peptide capable of activating M phi tumoricidal activity.","['Roussel, E', 'Greenberg, A H']","['Roussel E', 'Greenberg AH']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*analysis/enzymology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*analysis/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*analysis', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophage-Activating Factors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jan 15;142(2):543-8.,,,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-Activating Factors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently demonstrated that TNF is also produced by transformed human epithelial cells. The present studies have examined TNF expression in human myeloid leukemic cells. We have monitored TNF expression at a cellular level using alkaline phosphatase detection of a biotinylated TNF cDNA probe in situ. Using this approach, TNF transcripts were detectable in HL-60 cells induced along the monocytic lineage by phorbol ester but not in uninduced cells. The specific detection of TNF RNA at a cellular level was supported by the absence of histochemical staining in RNase-treated cells and when using biotinylated pBR322 plasmid without insert. These studies were extended to preparations of purified acute myeloblastic leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that TNF is expressed in myeloblasts in eight of nine patients with AML. In each preparation of myeloblasts with detectable TNF RNA, transcripts were present at 89-98% of the cells. The identification of TNF RNA in situ was also associated with the detection of TNF protein in leukemic blasts by indirect immunofluorescence. Moreover, the detection of TNF protein in these preparations of myeloblasts was confirmed by immunoblotting. However, using this approach to examine AML cells before and after purification indicated that TNF expression is induced as a result of the enrichment procedures.

In this collaborative study, we report five patients with ANLL and a t(3;5) in their leukemic cells. At diagnosis, four of the patients had a t(3;5) as their sole karyotypic anomaly; the remaining patient had additional structural and numerical abnormalities. Careful cytogenetic analysis indicated that the breakpoints of this rearrangement are 3q25.1 and 5q34, in contrast to the various breakpoints reported in earlier studies (3q21----3q25 and 5q31----5q35). The karyotypic, morphologic, and clinical characteristics of this group, as well as those of 14 previously reported patients with the t(3;5), were compared to identify any features that might warrant consideration of a specific syndrome. The available information indicates a worldwide distribution and a nearly equal male:female ratio for patients with this translocation. The median age of the group, 37 years, was younger than that of all patients with ANLL, 49 years. A preceding myelodysplastic syndrome was observed in three patients. The limited numbers of observations on leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count precluded meaningful comparison with data for ANLL patients in general. Although each FAB morphologic subtype, except M3, occurred in patients with a t(3;5), the frequency of M6 was much greater than expected. Bone marrows from each of the five patients we report showed increased numbers of megakaryocytes; trilineage dysplasia was observed in the marrow of each of the four patients for whom it could be assessed.

We plated 1,000 bone marrow null cells per dish and in some experiments used polyclonal anti-gibbon IL-3 sera and anti-human GM-CSF. IL-3 or GM-CSF independently from each other supported eosinophil colony formation. Although IL-5 supported formation of small eosinophil colonies, the number of colonies were significantly smaller than that supported by GM-CSF or IL-3. Cytological examination of the constituent cells revealed that some of the apparent eosinophil colonies supported by IL-3 and GM-CSF were mixed colonies containing eosinophils and one or more other lineages. In addition, the majority of the eosinophils seen in cultures with IL-3 and/or GM-CSF proved to be early eosinophil precursors including eosinophilic promyelocytes, myelocytes, and meta-myelocytes. IL-5-supported eosinophil colonies were pure eosinophil colonies and contained mostly maturer eosinophils such as band and segmented forms. These observations indicated that the developmental stages of the targets of IL-3 and GM-CSF are earlier than those of IL-5 and that the primary function of IL-5 is to support terminal maturation of eosinophils.","['Sonoda, Y', 'Arai, N', 'Ogawa, M']","['Sonoda Y', 'Arai N', 'Ogawa M']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Eosinophils/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jan;3(1):14-8.,,['DK 32294/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We looked in the literature and our own data for a categorization of AIL (IBL, LgX) and related disorders, needed for future prospective studies. Specific differences in the original histologic definitions and discordant immunophenotypic data may warrant the separate consideration of AIL, IBL and LgX and their subdivision into predominantly T cell or B cell lesions. DNA hybridization and cytogenetic studies of the processes sharing histologic features of AIL (IBL, LgX) demonstrate a continuum of disorders from purely reactive to frankly malignant, which may be categorized as follows: (1) those without evidence of clonality by any of three parameters (immunophenotypic, immunogenotypic, and cytogenetic), for which only the term AIL (IBL, LgX) might be reserved; (2) those with evidence of clonality by all parameters, or AIL (IBL, LgX)-like lymphomas; and (3) those that, due to any discordance among the three parameters, do not fit into either of the above categories, and for which the term AIL (IBL, LgX)-like dysplasias is proposed. This intermediate group seems to be composed of unstable lymphoproliferative conditions, in which a predominant component of normal cells coexists with clonal population(s) that may either disappear with time or selectively proliferate and develop into frank lymphoma.","['Frizzera, G', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Sakurai, M']","['Frizzera G', 'Kaneko Y', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Humans', '*Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/classification/genetics/pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jan;3(1):1-5.,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, these two responses are largely dependent on external Ca2+. We report here that cells labeled with myo-[3H]inositol and permeabilized with streptolysin O do release [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate upon stimulation with antigen or guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) at low (less than 100 nM) concentrations of free Ca2+. The response, however, is amplified by increasing free Ca2+ to 1 microM. The subsequent conversion of the trisphosphate to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is enhanced also by the increase in free Ca2+. Although [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulates in greater amounts than is the case in intact cells, [3H]inositol 1,4-bisphosphate is still the major product in permeabilized cells even when the further metabolism of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is suppressed (by 77%) by the addition of excess (1000 microM) unlabeled inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the phosphatase inhibitor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. It would appear that either the activity of the membrane 5-phosphomonoesterase allows virtually instantaneous dephosphorylation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate under all conditions tested or both phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and the 4,5-bisphosphate are substrates for the activated phospholipase C. The latter alternative is supported by the finding that permeabilized cells, which respond much more vigorously to high (supraoptimal) concentrations of antigen than do intact RBL-2H3 cells, produce substantial amounts of [3H]inositol 1,4-bisphosphate before any detectable increase in levels of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.","['Ali, H', 'Cunha-Melo, J R', 'Beaven, M A']","['Ali H', 'Cunha-Melo JR', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Inst., Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Exocytosis', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Streptolysins/*pharmacology', 'Sugar Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",1989/01/17 00:00,1989/01/17 00:01,['1989/01/17 00:00'],"['1989/01/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/17 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(89)90188-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(89)90188-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Jan 17;1010(1):88-99. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(89)90188-2.,,,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (streptolysin O)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '47055-78-7 (inositol 1,4-bis(phosphate))', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were separated with respective mol. wt of 21, 25, 38, 55, 70, 80 and 110 kDa, among which the 38 kDa species is predominant. Moreover, incubation of Jurkat T cells with sodium orthovanadate, a potent inhibitor of phosphotyrosine protein-phosphatases, was found to potentiate the effects of anti-CD3 mAb on tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition vanadate also induced IL-2 secretion in Jurkat cells when associated with the phorbol ester TPA, further demonstrating the importance of these phosphorylation reactions in the process of T cell activation.

Therefore, new therapeutic approaches have to be developed for this malignancy. In this paper, we investigated the possibility of the in vitro generation and expansion of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in patients with disseminated neuroblastoma. Although the patients had very low Natural Killer (NK) activity, it was possible to induce LAK activity in peripheral mononuclear lymphocytes (PMNC) by incubation with Interleukin-2 (IL-2).

Since the metabolism of the infiltrated organ might be correlated with an interaction of two cell populations, it was decided to study the isolated hematopoietic cells separately. The metabolism of these cells embedded in an agarose gel and perfused with labeled substrates was investigated using 31P and 13C NMR. Using [1-13C]glucose as precursor, sequential 13C NMR spectra showed that the hematopoietic cells were able to store glucose as [1-13C]glycogen and to metabolize it through the glycolytic pathway to give [3-13C]lactate as sole end-product. The liver neoglucogenic substrates: [2-13C]pyruvate and [3-13C]alanine are not metabolized by these cells. This suggests that the tricarboxylic acid cycle was not efficient. To investigate further the glycolytic properties of the cells, 10 mM sodium azide was added to the medium containing [1-13C]glucose. When compared to the aerobic conditions, a 40% decrease of nucleotides (0.10 vs 0.17 mumole NTP/10(9) cells), a degradation of [1-13C]glycogen and an increase of ca 35% of the glycolytic rate were observed. The analysis of 13C NMR spectra of the perfusates at the end of the perfusion indicates a total conversion of [1-13C]glucose into [3-13C]lactate and [3-13C]pyruvate under anaerobic conditions. These results permit a better understanding of the metabolism of the perfused leukemic livers which are extensively infiltrated by these hematopoietic cells.","['Megnin, F', 'Nedelec, J F', 'Dimicoli, J L', 'Lhoste, J M']","['Megnin F', 'Nedelec JF', 'Dimicoli JL', 'Lhoste JM']","['Institut Curie, Biologie, (INSERM U.219), Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,NMR Biomed,NMR in biomedicine,8915233,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/nbm.1940020106 [doi]'],ppublish,NMR Biomed. 1989 Jun;2(1):27-33. doi: 10.1002/nbm.1940020106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No significant qualitative differences in the high performance liquid chromatography elution patterns of polar metabolites were observed under any circumstances. These results indicate that inherent cellular properties, not associated with gross differences in RA uptake or metabolism, primarily determined the relative sensitivity or insensitivity of HL-60 cells to RA-induced differentiation but that RA responsiveness was markedly regulated by extracellular factors, one of which, serum albumin, appeared to act by decreasing the initial cell association and metabolism of RA, whereas other, as yet unidentified exogenous factors, may have acted independently of these functions.","['Gallagher, R E', 'de Cuevillas, F', 'Chang, C S', 'Schwartz, E L']","['Gallagher RE', 'de Cuevillas F', 'Chang CS', 'Schwartz EL']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/095535489820875435 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(1):45-54. doi: 10.3727/095535489820875435.,,['CA-42047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Culture Media)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the concentration of drug required to produce this effect is clinically achievable, the use of this drug would be hampered by significant immunosuppression. We report a comparison of the effects of 11-methyl-leucine cyclosporin (11-met-leu CsA), a non-immunosuppressive homolog to the parent drug, on MDR cell lines. Both cyclosporins sensitized resistant cell lines to doxorubicin, including P388 murine leukemia and GM 3639 human T-cell leukemia. The action of the cyclosporins was more pronounced with resistant cells than with sensitive ones. 11-Met-leu CsA was less potent than, but equally effective as, the parent drug. Both agents increased the intracellular accumulation and retention of doxorubicin in MDR cells. The sensitization caused by the cyclosporins was independent of their effects on cyclophilin, calmodulin, and protein kinase C. Furthermore, there were no differences in the binding of labelled CsA to MDR cells compared to the binding to sensitive cells, suggesting that P-glycoprotein was also not the molecular site of action.

'In vivo' and 'in vitro' experiments pointed out an immunological cross reactivity between DTIC treated and untreated lines. Furthermore, specific CTLs raised against DTIC treated L1210 tumour cells (H-2d) were cytotoxic for H-2k target cells. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the H-2k cross reactivity displayed by L1210/DTIC is related to the drug treatment rather than due to an antigen already present in the parental line and maintained after treatment. Cloned cells from L1210, obtained by limiting dilution 'in vitro', were recloned 'in vivo' and then treated with DTIC. Syngeneic and allogeneic CTLs raised 'in vitro' against parental and treated clones showed lytic activity against H-2k target cells. Treated and untreated clones were then checked for the presence of H-2k-like determinants using monoclonal antibodies. One of these, HB-53 (IgG2bKkDk) was highly positive with all the clones tested in binding assay using iodinated Fab anti-mouse Ig, fluorescence and FACS analysis. Others displayed a low reactivity against both treated and untreated clones without significant differences. After neuraminidase treatment of two clones (D and D/DTIC), the H-100.5 (anti H-2Kk)-reactive epitope was dramatically exposed on the DTIC tumour cells but not on the parental clones.

In the present study, we have monitored the effects of tiazofurin on differentiation and proto-oncogene expression in K562 erythroleukemia cells. Tiazofurin induced K562 cell hemoglobin production in a concentration-dependent manner. This induction of a differentiated phenotype was also associated with a loss of proliferative capacity. In contrast to the reversible effects of hemin on induction of K562 cell hemoglobin synthesis, the effects of tiazofurin were irreversible. Northern blot analysis of K562 cells treated with 10 microM tiazofurin demonstrated the accumulation of alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA. The results also demonstrate that there was little if any effect of tiazofurin on levels of c-myc, c-myb, or c-abl mRNA. Furthermore, there were no detectable changes in Ki-ras, Ha-ras or N-ras expression at the mRNA and protein levels in tiazofurin-treated K562 cells.

Because the redox cycling of the quinone moiety of Adriamycin is known to produce oxidative stress, however, an analysis of glutathione (GSH) and related enzyme systems was undertaken in the wild-type and selected resistant cells. In ARN1 and ARN2, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were slightly decreased, intracellular GSH and GSH reductase were essentially unchanged, and total GSH peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and DT-diaphorase activities were slightly elevated. In each case there was no stoichiometric relationship between degree of resistance and level of activity. GST isozymes were purified from each cell line by HPLC GSH affinity column chromatography. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blot immunoreactivity against a battery of GST isozyme polyclonal antibodies determined that both the resistant and sensitive cells expressed isozymes of the alpha, pi, and mu classes (alternative murine nomenclature: M1, M2, M3). Of significance, both ARN1 and ARN2 cell lines expressed a unique alpha subunit which was absent from the parent FLC cell line. This isozyme presumably accounted for the increased GSH peroxidase activity (cumene hydroperoxide as substrate) found in ARN1 and ARN2 and may play a role in the small incremental resistance to melphalan found for both resistant lines. Expression of the isozyme was not stoichiometric with respect to degree of resistance. The presence of this isozyme may contribute to the resistant phenotype or may be the consequence of a more general cellular response to oxidative stress.","['Schisselbauer, J C', 'Crescimanno, M', ""D'Alessandro, N"", 'Clapper, M', 'Toulmond, S', 'Tapiero, H', 'Tew, K D']","['Schisselbauer JC', 'Crescimanno M', ""D'Alessandro N"", 'Clapper M', 'Toulmond S', 'Tapiero H', 'Tew KD']","['Department of Pharmacology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenotype', 'Quinone Reductases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/095535489820875291 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(2):133-9. doi: 10.3727/095535489820875291.,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (Quinone Reductases)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were stratified into two groups, i.e. standard-risk (SR) and high-risk (HR), according to their pre-treatment leukocyte count and age. Following induction therapy, 97% of the SR patients and 80% of the HR patients attained complete remission. In the SR group, the 2- and 3-year failure-free survival rates were 37% and 24%, with a median survival of 16 months. In the HR group, failure-free survival at the second and third year were 11% and 4%, respectively, with a median survival of 5.3 months. Three factors are strongly related to induction failure, i.e. high leukocyte counts (greater than 50*10(9)/1), massive hepatomegaly and large lymph nodes. Univariate analysis of failure-free survival showed six variables with significant detrimental effects on eventual outcomes, i.e. high leukocyte counts (greater than 50*10(9)/1), meningeal leukemia, marked lymphadenopathy, age younger than 2 years and older than 10 years, massive hepatomegaly (greater than 6 cm), and high LDH level (greater than 800 u/1). However, statistical survival models should also determine the joint effects of the prognostic factors so that the relative importance of each factor can be assessed. High initial leukocyte count, disclosed by multivariate analysis, was the single most important factor detrimental to the continuance of complete remission (P = 0.0004). Preliminary results also revealed poor compliance and early relapse in this study. Possible causes of early failure are discussed. Conceptual education for family members, as well as management with effective cytoreductive therapies are urgently needed.","['Chen, B W', 'Lin, D T', 'Lin, K H', 'Chuu, W M', 'Su, S', 'Lin, K S']","['Chen BW', 'Lin DT', 'Lin KH', 'Chuu WM', 'Su S', 'Lin KS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Min Guo Xiao Er Ke Yi Xue Hui Za Zhi,Zhonghua Minguo xiao er ke yi xue hui za zhi [Journal].

The objectives of this study were to develop a physiological model for the metabolism of benzene, based on studies in laboratory animals, and to use this model to predict benzene metabolism in people to concentrations near the current permissible exposure limits. Model simulations predicted that for 8-h inhalation exposures to below 10 ppm, hydroquinone metabolites would predominate. Hydroquinone is associated with pathways leading to the formation of the putative toxic metabolite, benzoquinone. Lower levels of muconic acid, a marker for the putative toxic metabolite, muconaldehyde, were predicted. At concentrations above 10 ppm, detoxification metabolites such as the phenyl conjugates predominate. Predictions of benzene metabolism in humans based on our physiological model may have important implications for risk assessment. Because there may be preferential production of a putative toxic metabolite at low exposure concentrations, linear extrapolation of toxicity observed at high concentrations may underestimate risk at low exposure concentrations.","['Medinsky, M A', 'Sabourin, P J', 'Lucier, G', 'Birnbaum, L S', 'Henderson, R F']","['Medinsky MA', 'Sabourin PJ', 'Lucier G', 'Birnbaum LS', 'Henderson RF']","['Lovelace Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM 87185.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Exp Pathol,Experimental pathology,8108218,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Risk Factors']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0232-1513(89)80036-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Pathol. 1989;37(1-4):150-4. doi: 10.1016/s0232-1513(89)80036-2.,,['222-ES-20092/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],['J64922108F (Benzene)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cases under the influence of bone marrow from patients having the same disease the early embryonic cells differentiate into mesodermal cell types, which normally appear under the low concentration of SMCT.

In a previous work IL-6 promoted the growth of early multipotential progenitor cells circulating in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patients. IL-6 alone did not stimulate growth of either early or later normal progenitor cells. However, a significant synergistic effect was obtained when IL-6 and IL-3 were added together (p less than 0.05).

Thus, our results suggest that the multi-functional cytokine IL-6, may be of use in shortening the engraftment time in bone marrow transplantation.","['Michalevicz, R', 'Lifshitz, D', 'Revel, M']","['Michalevicz R', 'Lifshitz D', 'Revel M']","['Hematology Institute, Ichilov Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Scanning Microsc,Scanning microscopy,8704616,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scanning Microsc. 1989 Dec;3(4):1143-9; discussion 1149-50.,,,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The crude DLE suppressed the blast-formation of the PHA-stimulated lymphocytes and proliferation of the leukemic cell-lines but enhanced that of the fibroblastic cells. A certain fraction of the DLE caused the ATP level of the stimulated lymphocytes to rise, after incubation for 24 hours. The fraction was further purified and the inosine eluted from it. The inosine increased the ATP level and markedly enhanced the lymphocyte blast-formation and proliferation of the fibroblastic cells and leukemic cell-lines. It is suggested that when the DLE show some effects on the lymphocytes, the inosine contained in the DLE may show important effects.

Although the mechanism of action of alpha-IFN is not wholly understood, it is known that this agent is a strong stimulant of the natural killer lymphocytes (NK). NK activity has been found decreased in B-CLL. In the present work the effect of alpha-IFN on NK activity was studied in 9 previously untreated B-CLL patients in stage A, who received chlorambucil (CLB) followed by alpha-IFN for at least 4 months. The disease stage did not change in most of the patients during alkylating or IFN therapy. CLB failed to increase NK activity, although it diminished the lymphocyte count. Although the lymphocyte count of the patients treated with alpha-IFN was not reduced beyond the values attained by CLB, NK activity reached normal values in 5 of the 7 patients in whom this was low, and kept within normal ranges in the two patients with normal NK activity. The number of CD57+ lymphocytes (this being the antigen present in NK cells) increased after alpha-IFN treatment, without any changes in the remaining T-lymphocyte (CD2, CD4 and CD8) and NK (CD16 and CD11b) subpopulations.

Dependence on the blast count and phenotype, and response to exogenous and endogenous alpha-interferon.",9-15,"Endogenous NK-activity (eNK) against K-562 cells was determined in peripheral blood of 68 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) before treatment. In 53% of them it was depressed, and in 47% it was within the range of control children (27) and adults (104). There was a significant negative correlation between blast contamination of peripheral blood and the level of eNK-activity. In spite of this general trend, 8 patients with high blast count have had normal eNK-activity, and 10 patients with relatively low blast count (below 50%) have had depressed eNK-activity. Examples of T ALL showed significantly lower eNK-activity than CALLA ALL. The ability of exogenous alpha-interferon (IFN) to stimulate eNK-activity was impaired in 18 of 40 examples of ALL and preserved in 22. The IFN-induced NK-response was also negatively correlated to the blast burden, but again with exceptions: Six nonresponders in spite of low blast count, and six responders in spite of high blast count in peripheral blood. IFN-inducer, poly-IC, stimulated eNK-activity only in 6 of 26 ALL samples. Surprisingly, positive correlation was found between poly-IC-induced NK-stimulation and blast count in peripheral blood. Poly-IC induced significant IFN production only in one of six cultures of ALL. Impaired eNK-activity has been attributed, in part, to ""dilution"" of NK cells by the blasts. Defects in production of IFN, and in response to it, may be additional reasons for depressed NK-activity in about 50% of children with untreated ALL.","['Gabrilovac, J', 'Rajic, L', 'Martin-Kleiner, I', 'Osmak, M', 'Batinic, D', 'Tiefenbach, A', 'Boranic, M']","['Gabrilovac J', 'Rajic L', 'Martin-Kleiner I', 'Osmak M', 'Batinic D', 'Tiefenbach A', 'Boranic M']","['Ruder Boskovic Institute, Department of Experimental Biology and Medicine, Zagreb, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Scotland,J Clin Lab Immunol,Journal of clinical & laboratory immunology,7808987,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Interferon Type I/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Lab Immunol. 1989 May;29(1):9-15.,,,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these cellular genes is the probable murine homolog of the yeast ribosomal protein L3, responsible for trichodermin resistance. In all cases, virus activation appears to involve production of viral transcripts that are initiated in the 5'-flanking region, transcribed through the viral LTR, and subsequently spliced from a cellular donor to a viral acceptor.

However, relapse remains the major cause for failure of autologous BMT in these diseases and of allogeneic BMT in subsets of patients with these diseases. With our current preparative regimens, relapse rates following autologous BMT are over 30% for patients with intermediate or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed Hodgkin's disease in sensitive relapse and over 50% following autologous BMT for patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Relapse rates exceed 80% in patients treated with autologous BMT for non-Hodgkin lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease in drug-resistant relapse. We also see a relapse rate over 50% in patients given allogeneic BMT for ANLL in second or third remission or early relapse, for ALL in third or subsequent remission or early relapse, and for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in accelerated phase or blast crisis. We have explored two new approaches for improving the anti-tumor activity of our BMT preparative regimens. One involves combining etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent that has excellent activity against leukemias and lymphomas, has shown synergistic activity with cyclophosphamide in vitro, and can be substantially dose-escalated, with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The other approach attempts to induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which appears to provide a clinical anti-tumor effect following allogeneic BMT, in recipients of autologous BMT. A syndrome similar to mild GVHD has been reported to occur spontaneously in a small number of patients receiving autologous or syngeneic transplants. GVHD can also be induced in rats undergoing syngeneic BMT by treatment with cyclosporine (CSA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jones, R J', 'Santos, G W']","['Jones RJ', 'Santos GW']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Graft vs Host Disease/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/surgery', 'Middle Aged']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Dec;4 Suppl 4:15-7.,,,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to study the RBC polyamine level evolution (Spd and Spm) in bone marrow (BM) transplanted children. Because of our interest in the finding of an early blood criteria of BM regeneration, our study was based upon the chemotherapy - induced post-transplant aplasia period. After BM transplantation, two main periods were observed: the first (A-period) corresponded to abnormally low Spd levels. This period ended with an increasing amount of Spd reaching normal values and with an inversion in the Spd/Spm ratio which became greater than 1. The second (B) period was usually linked to abnormally high RBC Spd concentrations and a Spd/Spm ratio greater than 1. The end of the B-period was characterized by an increase in the granulocyte count (reaching 0.5 X 10(9) cells/l). Since the A- and B-periods are considered as a post-transplant aplasia period (only according to leukocyte count) and since normal RBC Spd levels occurred 14 days (SD = 4) after BM transplantation and 16 days (SD = 12) before granulocyte rise, these data led us to consider erythrocyte polyamine levels to be an earlier biological criteria of bone marrow engraftment than the number of circulating granulocytes.","['Bergeron, C', 'Bouet, F', 'Quemener, V', 'Havouis, R', 'Martin, L A', 'Le Gall, E', 'Moulinoux, J P']","['Bergeron C', 'Bouet F', 'Quemener V', 'Havouis R', 'Martin LA', 'Le Gall E', 'Moulinoux JP']","[""Unite d'Hemato-oncologie Pediatrique, Hopital Sud, Rennes, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/*blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/blood/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/blood/*surgery', 'Reference Values', 'Spermidine/*blood', 'Spermine/*blood', 'Teratoma/blood/*surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Nov-Dec;9(6):1757-60.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas a phenotypic switch from lymphoblastic to myeloid has been documented twice, the sequence of myeloid followed by a lymphoblastic BC has, to our knowledge, not been reported so far. Lymphoblastic BC responded to a combination of vindesine/prednisone and 6-mercaptopurin.

The total DNA from the labelled nuclei was used as probes to hybridize restricted fragments of beta-like globin genes which have been immobilized on Diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM) paper. Using this approach we have observed that in K 562 nuclei all beta-like globin genes, including epsilon, gamma, delta, and beta-globin genes and human 18 S ribosomal genes are preferentially labelled in comparison to alpha-lactalbumin and c-sis genes which do not express in K 562 cells, but the total DNA from nick-translated nuclei of a nonerythroid cell line hybridized none of those genes except for 18 S ribosomal gene.

Mostly, a conversion from the lymphoid to the myeloid phenotype is seen. In our three cases we found two switches from the myeloid to the lymphoid phenotype and only one from lymphoid to myeloid. This lineage switch is seen in relapsing and resistant leukemia cases. Different hypotheses have been discussed concerning the phenotype switch. Cytostatic chemotherapy may eradicate one leukemic cell clone, allowing another one to proliferate. Otherwise, the leukemic transformed stem cell could be influenced by the chemotherapy, resulting in a change of the differentiation program of the cell and following with a switch of marker expression. Perhaps there is some clinical importance to monitoring the phenotype switch in order to administer the best treatment.","['Ihle, R', 'Matthes, H', 'Ihle, H']","['Ihle R', 'Matthes H', 'Ihle H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Charite, Humboldt-Universitat Berlin, German Democratic Republic.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-74621-5_16 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1989;32:101-3. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74621-5_16.,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A regime was established to generate subcultures up to 35 cumulative population doublings (CPDs) in normal cells and to 9 CPDs in leukemic cells. In both types of cells, collagen synthesis decreased as subcultivation progressed.

Lack of agreement between alteration of transferrin receptor and CD15 antigen expressions and induction of resistance to natural killer.",289-94,"Little is known about membrane target antigens for natural killer (NK) cells. Transferrin receptor and CD15 antigen might be two of these target structures. A novel antileukemic alkaloid, fagaronine, is able to induce hemoglobin synthesis in the K562 cell line. Numerous reports suggest relations between the expression of natural killer target structures and the differentiation stage of malignant cells. Effects of fagaronine on the expression of glycophorin A, transferrin receptor and CD15 antigen and susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis have been investigated in K562 cells and compared to those of two anthracyclines (Adriamycin and aclacinomycin A) known to be erythroid-differentiation inducers. When comparing the balance of differentiating effect and toxicity, the dose and time-dependent effects of the drugs, fagaronine and aclacinomycin, are equivalent on K562 cells. In experimental conditions where fagaronine (3500 nM), Adriamycin (40 nM) and aclacinomycin (15 nM) recruit the same percentage of hemoglobin-containing cells (40%-50%), glycophorin A expression increases and transferrin receptor expression decreases. Only Adriamycin treatment decreases CD15 antigen expression. In addition, Adriamycin and aclacinomycin, but not fagaronine, induce resistance to NK-mediated lysis. These data suggest that (a) it is unlikely that CD15 antigen and transferrin receptor, separately considered, can be unique target structures for NK cells; and (b) fagaronine is a potent erythroid inducer which, in our system, has similar effects to aclacinomycin without induced resistance to NK attack.","['Benoist, H', 'Comoe, L', 'Joly, P', 'Carpentier, Y', 'Desplaces, A', 'Dufer, J']","['Benoist H', 'Comoe L', 'Joly P', 'Carpentier Y', 'Desplaces A', 'Dufer J']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, UFR de Pharmacie, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Aclarubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/*immunology', '*Phenanthridines', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01744896 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1989;30(5):289-94. doi: 10.1007/BF01744896.,,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '41758-44-5 (fagaronine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the purpose of this study to compare these analogs under identical conditions in order to define their inhibitory properties and the underlying mechanism in L1210 mouse leukemia cells. In a 5-day cell growth experiment, DAP exerted a significantly stronger antiproliferative effect than DAPdR. Correspondingly, colony formation of L1210 cells in soft agarose was inhibited by DAP to a greater extent than by DAPdR. A differential distribution of L1210 cells in the cell cycle resulted from an exposure to DAP and DAPdR. While DAPdR arrested cells in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle, DAP appeared to lead to an accumulation of G2/M cells. The diaminopurines were combined with modulatory agents to test the antiproliferative action of the combinations. Deoxycytidine partially rescued the cells from the growth inhibitory action of DAPdR without affecting the growth of DAP-treated cells. When adenine was used, the antiproliferative effect of DAPdR was slightly enhanced while the effect of DAP was completely abolished. 8-Aminoguanosine, a specific inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, synergistically potentiated the cytostatic effect of DAPdR. However, this inhibitor did not alter DAP effects. At the biochemical level, the target of DAPdR was ribonucleotide reductase which was in line with a drastic expansion of the dGTP pool in DAPdR-treated cells. In cells exposed to DAP, high levels of DAP riboside triphosphate were measured; concomitantly, the ATP level dropped markedly. Enzymological studies revealed that DAPdR is an excellent substrate of adenosine deaminase giving rise to the formation of deoxyguanosine. DAP was found to be activated in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase reaction and in a phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate-dependent reaction. The data from this comparative study suggest that DAPdR and DAP possess different toxicity mechanisms. DAPdR and DAP possess different toxicity mechanisms. DAPdR acts as a precursor of deoxyguanosine, and DAP is metabolically activated to DAP-containing ribonucleotide analogs. These different metabolic routes seem to account for the different effects of DAP and DAPdR at the cellular level.","['Weckbecker, G', 'Cory, J G']","['Weckbecker G', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, H.

The administration of FUra at its maximally tolerated dose (MTD) followed 24 h later by low doses of cis-DDP yielded less toxicity and higher response rate against L1210 and colon 26 than the administration of these two agents in the opposite sequence or concurrently at the MTD. The sequence of administration of these two agents was not therapeutically important when the antitumor activity was evaluated against mice bearing lymphoma P388. These results indicate that the importance of sequencing of FUra and cis-DDP varies among different tumors. The biochemical basis for the therapeutic importance of sequencing in treatments with cis-DDP and FUra was investigated in mice bearing leukemia L1210 cells. While cis-DDP has no significant effects on the activity of thymidylate synthase (dTMP-S), the target enzyme for FUra action, recovery of dTMP-S inhibition following pretreatment with FUra was significantly delayed when cis-DDP was administered 12-24 h after the initial dose of FUra.","['Palmeri, S', 'Trave, F', 'Russello, O', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Palmeri S', 'Trave F', 'Russello O', 'Rustum YM']","['Istituto di Farmacologia, Universita di Palermo, Sicily, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Sel Cancer Ther,Selective cancer therapeutics,8912502,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/sct.1989.5.169 [doi]'],ppublish,Sel Cancer Ther. 1989 Winter;5(4):169-77. doi: 10.1089/sct.1989.5.169.,,['CA18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial phase of antitumor effect consisted of the marked increase in the number of peritoneal exudate cells and the enhanced cytotoxicity of peritoneal exudate cells. The Winn assay disclosed that antitumor effect by which tumor-burden mice could survive was attributable to nonadherent splenocytes whose activity was impaired by treatment with anti-T cell serum and complement. A single injection of FK.CK induced the cytotoxicity to three different murine tumor cells in serum of treated mice without a boosting injection of endotoxin. Furthermore, the generation of effector cells and serum cytotoxicity seemed to be paralleled by that of the delayed-type hypersensitivity to this organism.

However, no conclusions on dose-response relationships can be drawn from these data because of the approximate evaluation of individual exposure and, especially, because the study group most probably consisted of a highly selected sample of the exposed population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Vai, T', 'Radice, L', 'Catenacci, G', 'Biscaldi, G P', 'Guercilena, S', 'Pesatori, A C', 'Bertazzi, P A']","['Vai T', 'Radice L', 'Catenacci G', 'Biscaldi GP', 'Guercilena S', 'Pesatori AC', 'Bertazzi PA']",,['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Time Factors']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 1989 Sep-Oct;80(5):397-404.,,,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],Studio a distanza di 304 casi di sospetta patologia da benzene osservati negli anni 1950-1971.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The husband of one of the patients with TSP was also infected with HTLV-1 and had a T-cell lymphoma. In addition, six asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected first-degree relatives of the TSP patients have been found. By anonymous testing of over 700 sera obtained from individuals of Afro-Caribbean, African, or Asian ethnic origin, seven HTLV-1-infected individuals were detected, who were all immigrants from the Caribbean. Overall, these numbers yielded a seroprevalence of HTLV-1 infections of 3.4% among the immigrant population of Afro-Caribbean origin, which is comparable with the prevalence of HTLV-1 in Jamaica in an equivalent age and sex cohort. Sera were tested for HTLV-1 antibody by means of three different procedures: passive particle agglutination test (Serodia), indirect enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Dupont), and indirect immunofluorescence test (in-house, using HTLV-1-infected MT2 cells). The results of all three tests correlated very well with each other.

Increased sensitivity to natural killer cytotoxic factor (NKCF).,521-34,"Irradiation with low-doses of X-rays of tumor cells elevated their susceptibility to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells in an accompanying paper. Cytotoxicity assays conducted at the single cell level revealed that X-ray irradiation of K562 cells did not affect the number of effector-target conjugates but increased the frequency of dead conjugated target cells. During interaction with K562 cells large granular lymphocytes released a soluble cytotoxic factor (NKCF) that killed the target cells. X-ray irradiation did not affect the NKCF stimulatory ability of K562 cells, while it elevated their sensitivity to the lytic effect of NKCF. In contrast to X-rays, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation of K562 cells did not elevate their NK sensitivity but rather reduced it. Treatment with mitomycin C produced no effect on NK sensitivity. These results indicate that X-ray irradiation elevates the target sensitivity to NKCF, which may be involved in the increased NK sensitivity, and that the X-ray effect may be different from that of UV radiation or DNA synthesis inhibition.","['Uchida, A', 'Mizutani, Y', 'Nagamuta, M', 'Ikenaga, M']","['Uchida A', 'Mizutani Y', 'Nagamuta M', 'Ikenaga M']","['Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,IM,"['Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08923978909005382 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 1989;11(2-3):521-34. doi: 10.3109/08923978909005382.,,,['0 (Mitomycins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Farmers had elevated risks for malignant melanoma (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.05-1.50), and for cancer of the lip (OR = 2.43, 95% Cl 1.81-3.27), rectum (OR = 1.19, 95% Cl 1.03-1.38), bone (OR = 1.95, 95% Cl 1.00-3.80), prostate (OR = 1.26, 95% Cl 1.13-1.41) and brain (OR = 1.34, 95% Cl 1.04-1.74). Decreased risks were observed for cancer of the larynx (OR = 0.66, 95% Cl 0.45-0.96), lung (OR = 0.70, 95% Cl 0.63-0.77) and testis (OR = 0.58, 95% Cl 0.39-0.88). Livestock farmers had a relatively high risk for brain cancer, while the risk for cancer of the lip was highest among dairy farmers. Farmers also had increased risks for cancer of the lymphatic and haematopoietic system (International Classification of Disease 9th edn (ICD) 200-208) (OR = 1.24, 95% Cl 1.08-1.42), leukaemia (OR = 1.24, 95% Cl 0.99-1.55) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (OR = 1.24, 95% Cl 0.99-1.56), as described previously.","['Reif, J', 'Pearce, N', 'Fraser, J']","['Reif J', 'Pearce N', 'Fraser J']","['Department of Environmental Health, Colorado State University, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,"['Adult', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*epidemiology"", 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'New Zealand', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/18.4.768 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1989 Dec;18(4):768-74. doi: 10.1093/ije/18.4.768.,,['1 F06 TWO 1327-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certainly the attempts at technical improvements have made an impact on granulocyte availability and donor pools large enough to support twice daily transfusions should also improve the efficacy of a series of transfusions. The majority of bacterial infections in neutropenic patients do not necessitate granulocyte transfusions due to the rapid empiric use of modern broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, a proportion still do, and selection of appropriate candidates for granulocyte transfusions may improve the outcome. The use in fungal infections remains experimental, but as has been said by others in addition to myself, should be studied. Issues of histocompatibility remain complex. Patients rendered severely immunocompromised may have less of an alloimmunization response to transfusion products, but alloimmunization continues to be a complication of granulocyte transfusions. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplant have the advantage of access to an HLA-matched marrow and granulocyte donor. The techniques of granulocyte transfusion therapy must continue to be improved and utilized in part because our microbial foes continue to change and to resist our antibiotic improvements.

At physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C), the species distribution of GBG and MGBG differs remarkably from that of their inactive congeners, a noteworthy proportion of GBG (10.2%) and MGBG (4.0%) existing in the form of the free base while the corresponding proportion of their non-antiproliferative analogs is only 0.5% or less. Ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (EGBG), which has antiproliferative properties in vitro but is devoid of antileukemic activity in vivo, is intermediate between the two groups, 2.6% of it existing in the free base form. In contrast to what has been generally assumed, at physiological conditions, the predominant species of GBG, MGBG, and EGBG is the monocation form and not the dication. Considerable proportions of other congeners also exist in the monocation form. At slightly higher pH values that are of interest because of the known antimitochondrial effects of GBG and MGBG (and, in high concentrations, EGBG), the species distribution of GBG and MGBG differs even more remarkably from that of the dialkylglyoxal analogs. Thus, at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C, as much as 36% of GBG and 19% of MGBG exist in the free base form, the corresponding proportion of EGBG being 14% and that of the other congeners studies only ca. 3-4%. On the basis of the results, it appears possible that the unusually strict structure-activity relationships of this class of antineoplastic agents may be based on the remarkable differences between the species distributions of the various congeners. The hypothesis is presented that the actual antiproliferative and antimitochondrial species of the compounds is the free base form. A compilation of pKa1 and pKa2 values, measured by potentiometric methods in 0.1 M NaCl (aq) at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, is given for six bis(guanylhydrazones).

Caused by the disintegration products H inhibits the proliferation of L 5178 Y cells and decreases the cell volume and size of the nucleus. Thus in the eukaryotic cell H can be therapeutically important and therefore may prove successful not only against bacteria and viruses.","['Reitz, M', 'Jaeger, K H']","['Reitz M', 'Jaeger KH']","['Institute for Physiological Chemistry, University of Mainz, Fed.

In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that the leukemic cells from this patient were inhibitory for the growth of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic progenitor cells from normal peripheral blood. This inhibitory effect exhibited a dose-dependent relationship with the number of added lymphoblasts and persisted when the lymphoblasts were irradiated to prevent leukemic cell growth. Inhibitory activity was not present in media conditioned by the growth of the patient's lymphoblasts, nor was it present in lymphoblasts from three other children with ALL with similar immunophenotype but without marrow aplasia.

In the leukemic bone marrow cells, in contrast, there was a wide variation in sensitivity to Ara-C. The sensitivity did not correlate with the proliferating activity of leukemic cells. In two patients, there was a good correlation between in-vitro sensitivity and clinical response to Ara-C.","['Katano, N', 'Tsurusawa, M', 'Niwa, M', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Katano N', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Niwa M', 'Fujimoto T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1989 Winter;11(4):411-6.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reactivities of these antibodies with normal hematopoietic cells, malignant hematopoietic cell lines (N = 31), and fresh leukemic cells obtained from 128 patients with various types of leukemias were studied. All antibodies reacted only with erythrocytes among peripheral blood cells, and also KOR-E6 reacted only with erythroid cells among bone marrow cells. KOR-E3 had no reactivity with any cell lines examined, and KOR-E1 and KOR-E4 were reactive with some lymphoid cell lines. However, KOR-E6 had specific reactivities with erythroid (HEL, K562), megakaryocytic (CMK-1), multiphenotypic (KOPM-28), and basophilic (KU-812) cell lines.

The toxicity has been assumed to be correlated with the binding of the drug to cellular thiol groups.

Rana tadpole/adult Xenopus erythroid heterokaryons also exhibit this switch to adult Rana globin gene expression. These results indicate that trans-acting factors--and the globin gene regulatory mechanism of which they are a part--are conserved in vertebrate phylogeny.

Experiments to answer these questions are in progress and are briefly discussed. The influence of stage of erythroid differentiation of the larval and adult donor cells on the cross-inductions is also being explored.

The improved vector can transfer the human beta-globin gene to pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells (PHSC) of the mouse as shown by long-term expression of human beta-globin RNA and protein in peripheral blood, and the presence of the globin provirus in reconstituted myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages in primary and secondary recipients of virus-infected bone marrow.","['Gelinas, R E', 'Bender, M A', 'Miller, A D']","['Gelinas RE', 'Bender MA', 'Miller AD']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/growth & development', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1989;316B:235-49.,,"['CA-30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-37073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HMBA-mediated terminal differentiation of MELC is a multistep process. There is a latent period during which a number of changes occur including the appearance of Ca2+ and phospholipid independent PKC activity in the cytosol, and modulation in expression of several genes, including c-myc, c-myb, c-fos and the p53 genes. During this latent period there is neither detectable commitment to terminal differentiation (including terminal cell division) or increased transcription of the globin genes. HMBA-mediated commitment to terminal differentiation is first detected at about 12 hr and increases in a stochastic fashion, until over 95% of the population has been recruited to terminal differentiation by 48 to 60 hr. Commitment is associated with persistent HMBA-mediated suppression of c-myb gene expression. By 36 to 48 hr, transcription of the globin genes has increased by 10 to 30 fold, whereas transcription of rRNA genes is suppressed. The steroid, dexamethasone, and the tumor promotor, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, suppress HMBA-induced MEL cell terminal differentiation. The evidence indicates that these agents act at a late step during the latent period. Recently, we showed that MELC variants selected for resistance to vincristine have a marked increased sensitivity to HMBA. Compared to the parental MELC strains, vincristine resistant MELC are: A) responsive to 1/5 to 1/10 the concentration of HMBA; B) induced to terminal differentiation without a latent period and C) resistant to inhibition of HMBA induced terminal differentiation by dexamethasone or tumor promotor. The vincristine resistant MELC have characteristics of the multidrug resistant phenotype. A number of independently derived vincristine resistant MELC lines show similar altered response to HMBA. These findings suggest that vincristine resistance leads to a constitutive expression of a factor or factors induced by HMBA in vincristine sensitive (wild type) MELC during the latent period and which are essential to the transition to terminal differentiation.","['Marks, P A', 'Michaeli, J', 'Jackson, J', 'Richon, V M', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Marks PA', 'Michaeli J', 'Jackson J', 'Richon VM', 'Rifkind RA']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Drug Resistance', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1989;316B:171-81.,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basic concepts and practical application in tumor pathology.,878-85,"The purpose of this investigation is to give an introduction to a novel method in tumor pathology, namely the Ag-NOR technique. The basis of this method is the argyrophilic staining of intranucleolar, non-histone proteins which are specifically associated with transcriptionally active sites of ribosomal DNA. They can therefore be considered as a marker for the protein synthesis and thus the proliferation rate of a given cell. The morphologic basis of the argyrophilic reaction is presented by metaphasic and interphasic tissue culture cells. The applicability of Ag-NOR technique to tumor pathology is exemplified by main results of three studies dealing with tissue sections of 65 meningiomas, whole organ sections of 50 renal carcinomas, and cytospin preparations of 30 urinary washout specimens. These studies document the considerable value of the Ag-NOR content for both, malignancy diagnosis and tumor grading. With the help of image analysis it can be shown that besides the mean number of Ag-NORs the mean area per Ag-NOR dot is of diagnostic significance. In conclusion the Ag-NOR technique is a simple inexpensive and accurate method which can be applied both to formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and cytologic specimens. As a marker of malignancy it is an invaluable new tool for the diagnostic pathologist.","['Ruschoff, J', 'Plate, K', 'Bittinger, A', 'Thomas, C']","['Ruschoff J', 'Plate K', 'Bittinger A', 'Thomas C']","['Department of Pathology, Philipps University, Marburg, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Fibroblasts/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Interphase', 'Kidney Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Meningioma/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Metaphase', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*ultrastructure', 'Silver']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(89)80290-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(89)80290-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1989 Dec;185(6):878-85. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(89)80290-0.,,,['3M4G523W1G (Silver)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,
