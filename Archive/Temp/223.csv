Site-specific risks of cancer were analysed in relation to birth order within the twinship and sexes of the twin pair, using adjusted national birth data to give control distributions of these variables. Risk of leukaemia was increased in first-born twins, risk of testicular cancer was increased in second-born twins with female co-twins but decreased in second-born twins with male co-twins and lung cancer risk was increased in first-born twins with same-sex co-twins. Cutaneous melanoma risk was increased in persons with opposite-sex co-twins, nervous system cancer risk was increased in females with opposite-sex co-twins and Hodgkin's disease risk was increased in persons with same-sex co-twins. For most of the findings, no previous comparable analyses are available, so interpretation of the results must be provisional until the analyses can be repeated on other data. The result for leukaemia would accord with previous suggestions that leukaemia may be of prenatal origin and may sometimes lead to intrauterine death. The Hodgkin's disease result would fit with theories of an infectious aetiology, and this view is strengthened by reanalysis of previous data on paralytic poliomyelitis in twins, which show a pattern similar to that for the Hodgkin's disease patients. Cancer risk in relation to birth order and sex of twins can give novel, objective data relating to prenatal and infectious disease aetiology of cancers.","['Swerdlow, A J', 'De Stavola, B', 'Maconochie, N', 'Siskind, V']","['Swerdlow AJ', 'De Stavola B', 'Maconochie N', 'Siskind V']","['Epidemiological Monitoring Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adult', '*Birth Order', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Diseases in Twins/*epidemiology', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Wales/epidemiology']",1996/08/07 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/07 00:00'],"['1996/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960807)67:4<472::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960807)67:4<472::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-P [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Aug 7;67(4):472-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960807)67:4<472::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with parental K562 cells, VP-16-resistant K/VP.5 cells were found to be 3.4-fold more sensitive to the effects of dexrazoxane (ICRF-187), a topoisomerase II inhibitor that does not stabilize topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes. In contrast, K/VP.5 cells were 4.0-fold cross-resistant to merbarone and showed no cross-resistance to fostriecin, two other topoisomerase II inhibitors that do not stabilize topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes. Preincubation with ICRF-187 resulted in greater inhibition of subsequent VP-16-induced topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes in K/VP.5 cells than in K562 cells. Conversely, preincubation with merbarone resulted in less inhibition of VP-16-induced topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes in K/VP.5 cells than in parental K562 cells. Preincubation with forstriecin had little effect on VP-16-induced topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complex formation in either cell line. The onset rates for ICRF-187 inhibition of VP-16-induced topoisomerase II-DNA complex formation were similar in sensitive and resistant cells. In addition, ICRF-187 had a comparable concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the topoisomerase II catalytic activities of K562 and K/VP.5 cells. Together, our results indicate that collateral sensitivity to ICRF-187 in K/VP.5 cells is due to decreased topoisomerase II protein levels rather than to an alteration in topoisomerase II activity. Furthermore, results suggest that ICRF-187, merbarone, and fostriecin have different mechanisms of action that can be studied effectively in K/VP.5 and K562 cells.","['Fattman, C L', 'Allan, W P', 'Hasinoff, B B', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Fattman CL', 'Allan WP', 'Hasinoff BB', 'Yalowich JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones', 'Razoxane/*pharmacology', 'Thiobarbiturates/pharmacology']",1996/08/23 00:00,1996/08/23 00:01,['1996/08/23 00:00'],"['1996/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00338-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00338-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Aug 23;52(4):635-42. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00338-3.,,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis and protein tyrosine phosphorylation.",527-34,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the active metabolite of leflunomide, A77 1726 [N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl-2-cyano-3-hydroxycrotoamide)], is capable of inhibiting the activities of tyrosine kinases and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DHase). In the present study, we define the relative contribution of these activities to the ability of A77 1726 to inhibit proliferation of the murine leukemia cell line LSTRA. A77 1726 inhibited LSTRA cell growth and proliferation (IC50 = 10-30 microM); this inhibition, however, could be reversed by the addition of exogenous uridine, suggesting that the anti-proliferative activity of A77 1726 may be due to inhibition of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. Quantitation of nucleotide levels revealed that A77 1726, at an IC50 of about 10 microM, selectively inhibited pyrimidine nucleotide but not purine nucleotide synthesis. In vitro enzyme assays confirmed that A77 1726 directly inhibited the activity of DHO-DHase, the fourth enzyme in the de novo pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis (IC50 = 220 nM). LSTRA cells overexpress p56lck and have elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylated intracellular proteins. A77 1726 reduced the intracellular levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins with relatively high IC50 values ranging from 50 to 100 microM. A77 1726 also inhibited p56lck activity in LSTRA membrane preparation and immunoprecipitates; the IC50 values for inhibition of immunoprecipitated p56lck autophosphorylation and exogenous substrate histone 2B were 80 and 40 microM, respectively. The anti-tyrosine phosphorylation activity of A77 1726 was not affected by uridine. These studies therefore demonstrate the two activities of A77 1726: inhibition of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis and interference with tyrosine phosphorylation.","['Xu, X', 'Williams, J W', 'Gong, H', 'Finnegan, A', 'Chong, A S']","['Xu X', 'Williams JW', 'Gong H', 'Finnegan A', 'Chong AS']","[""Department of General Surgery, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leflunomide', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/pharmacology']",1996/08/23 00:00,1996/08/23 00:01,['1996/08/23 00:00'],"['1996/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00303-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00303-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Aug 23;52(4):527-34. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00303-6.,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'G162GK9U4W (Leflunomide)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",['AI 34061/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis using a CAT expression vector plasmid under the control of the ADF/Trx gene promoter revealed that CAT gene expression in Jurkat cells was increased after exposure to oxidative agents. A series of deletion analyses showed that a region from -976 to -890 of the 5' flanking sequence was required for enhancement of ADF/Trx promoter activity against the oxidative agents. Gel mobility shift assay revealed the specific DNA binding activities to the sequences from -953 to -930 in the nuclear extracts from the Jurkat cells.

Hematopoietic cell transformation by p2l0bcr/abl seems to involve activation of the Ras signaling pathway by at least two different signaling intermediates, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 and Src homology and collagen protein, but additional signaling proteins are likely to be required as well. In an effort to identify additional phosphoproteins activated by p210bcr/abl, we studied the murine, interleukin 3-dependent, myeloid cell line, 32D, and a bcr/abl-transfected, factor-independent subline, 32Dp210. The analysis of whole-cell lysates of 32D and 32Dp210 cells showed that several proteins with a molecular weight of Mr50,000-60,000 were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in 32Dp210 cells. Because Src family kinases have an apparent molecular weight of Mr50,000-60,000, we asked whether they could become activated by p2l0bcr/abl. Two Src family kinases, p53/56lyn and p59hck, showed a severalfold higher phosphokinase activity in 32Dp210 cells than in 32D cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Lyn, anti-Hck, and anti-Abl antibodies demonstrated an intracellular association of p210bcr/abl with p53/56lyn and p59hck. Moreover, the phosphokinase activity of p53/56lyn was higher in bcr/abl-positive myeloid cell lines (K562, BV173, and LAMA84) than in the bcr/abl-negative myeloid cell line JOSK-M. In conclusion, the results show that p210bcr/abl induces the activation of at least two Src family kinases, P53/56lyn and p59hck, in myeloid cells. These findings extend the range of potential targets of p210bcr/abl that might mediate its transforming effects.","['Danhauser-Riedl, S', 'Warmuth, M', 'Druker, B J', 'Emmerich, B', 'Hallek, M']","['Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Warmuth M', 'Druker BJ', 'Emmerich B', 'Hallek M']","['Medizinische Klinik, Klinikam Innenstadt, Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cytosol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Aug 1;56(15):3589-96.,,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, remissions are short-lived because the treatment fails to induce complete differentiation and fails to eradicate the malignant clone. To eliminate rapidly the malignant clone, in analogy with aggressive chemotherapy, the combination of potent differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing drugs working through different receptors and signal pathways may be useful. The active form of vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; 1,25(OH)2D3) inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. The 9-cis-RA, unlike all-trans-RA which binds only retinoic acid receptors, is a high affinity ligand for both retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of combining a vitamin D(3) analogue, 20-epi-22-oxa-24a,26a,27a-tri-homo-1alpha,25(OH) 2D, (KH 1060), which belongs to the family of potent 20-epi-1,25(OH),D3 analogues, with 9-cis-RA by assessing their effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of the human leukemia cell line HL-60 in vitro. Our data show that KH 1060 alone is a very potent inhibitor of clonal proliferation of HL-60, but this effect is reversible, and that 9-cis-RA alone is a weak inhibitor of clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells. In contrast, the combination of KH 1060 and 9-cis-RA synergistically and irreversibly inhibited the clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells and induced apoptosis, as detected by morphological changes and DNA fragmentation. This combination also affected the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The bcl-2 protein became nearly undetectable, and expression of bax protein increased slightly (the bax:bcl-2 ratio was 14-fold higher than in untreated cells). Differentiation of treated HL-60 cells was assessed by their ability to produce superoxide, as measured by reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium, positive staining for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, phagocytosis, morphology, and analysis of membrane-bound differentiation markers with two-color immunofluorescence. Treatment with the combination of KH 1060 and 9-cis-RA was a potent inducer of differentiation of HL-60, with the cells developing a myelomonocytic phenotype. In summary, our data demonstrate that the combination of both KH 1060 and 9-cis-RA irreversibly and synergistically inhibited clonal growth, induced differentiation and apoptosis of HL-60 cells concomitantly with a very marked decreased expression of bcl-2, and increased the bax:bcl-2 ratio. This drug combination may have important therapeutic significance.","['Elstner, E', 'Linker-Israeli, M', 'Umiel, T', 'Le, J', 'Grillier, I', 'Said, J', 'Shintaku, I P', 'Krajewski, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Binderup, L', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Elstner E', 'Linker-Israeli M', 'Umiel T', 'Le J', 'Grillier I', 'Said J', 'Shintaku IP', 'Krajewski S', 'Reed JC', 'Binderup L', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Aug 1;56(15):3570-6.,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']","['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA7065-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

With one-dimensional spectra, both resistant cell lines showed lower fatty acid methylene:methyl ratios and higher choline:methyl ratios than sensitive cells. Using two-dimensional COSY spectra, a decrease in the glutamine content was evidenced in resistant cells. When these cells were maintained in culture medium without the drug, the fatty acid signals were partially recovered. Adriamycin-resistant K562 cells were also treated for 4 days with a high dose of verapamil, a MDR-reversing agent. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of verapamil-treated cells also showed partial recovery of fatty acid signals. These results could be paralleled with the reversion of the resistant phenotype, as evidenced by measuring the inhibiting concentration of Adriamycin and vinblastine in K562adr cells cultured without the drug or after short-term exposure to verapamil. Conversely, P-glycoprotein and mRNA expression and DNA amplification of the mdr gene were not modified when compared to resistant cells, suggesting that the MDR phenotype could be partially reversed independently of the mdr gene amplification and expression.

These cytokines activate two distinct signals to the nucleus. One signal is through the Ras pathway, and the second involves activation of Jak2. We demonstrated that Bcr-Abl co-immunoprecipitates with, and constitutively phosphorylates, the common beta(c) subunit of the interleukin 3 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptors. Our data show that formation of this complex leads to the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with AL were treated with ABMT, including 13 cases of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and 7 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). A median of 1.06 (range, 0.69-1.75) x 10(8) nucleated BM cells/kg was harvested and stored in normal salt solution containing heparin at 4 degrees C. The conditioning regimen (MAC) consisted of high-dose melphalan (M, 140-160 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (CY, 120 mg/kg) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C, 2.0 g/m2). These 3 drugs were administered within 25 hours and the unpurged autologous marrow infusion began after another 24-hour interval. RESULTS: MAC regimen could result in myeloblastic efficacy in a week. All marrow cells were reinfused within 56 hours after the harvest so that hemopoietic reconstitutions could occur in all the patients. The median time to reach a neutrophil count of > 1.0 x 10(9)/L and a platelet count of > 50 x 10(9)/L was 20 and 26 days respectively. With a median observation period of 25 months, the median duration on continuous complete remission in our patients was 22 months, and the longest reached 56 months. The median survival was 33 months, and the longest was over 6 years. The event-free survival at 2 years had reached 72%. In seven patients with leukemic relapse, six (86%) relapsed within 8 months after ABMT. The relapse rate and mortality in AML patients were significantly lower than those in ALL patients. In 7 patients with M3, relapse had not yet been observed. The nonhematologic toxic effects of MAC conditioning regimen occurred mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicated that the ABMT using MAC conditioning regimen had some advantages in stronger antileukemic efficacy, less extrahematologic toxicity and earlier recovery of platelet and could greatly prolong the duration of remission and survival in some patients with AL.","['Wang, C', 'Qiao, Z', 'Yang, L', 'Ma, L', 'Zhang, H', 'Zhang, J']","['Wang C', 'Qiao Z', 'Yang L', 'Ma L', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical College, Taiyuan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1996 Apr;109(4):304-7.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'MAC conditioning regimen']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The methylation patterns of M-bcr in 23 patients with Ph' positive CML were studied. DNAs extracted from mononuclear cells of both chronic and blastic phases (20 cases) or blastic phases only (3 cases), were doubly digested with restriction enzymes HpaII and BglII, hybridized with a 5'M-bcr probe labeled with 32p-deoxycytidine triphosphate, and autoradiographed. RESULTS: In all the patients with myeloblastic crisis, DNAs from both chronic and blastic cells of each patient showed identical methylation patterns. There was substantial heterogeneity in methylation patterns in the patients with lymphoblastic crisis. All the lymphoblastic patterns were distinct from the chronic patterns as well as the patterns shown in myeloblastic crisis. Moreover, in four out of six patients with lymphoblastic crisis, the chronic patterns were different from those in cases with myeloblastic crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of M-bcr was stable during evolution of CML from chronic to myeloblastic phase. Analysis of M-bcr methylation status may be of clinical use in distinguishing lymphoblastic from myeloblastic crisis and predicting the cell lineage of crisis when the disease is still in its chronic phase.","['Ge, X', 'Tanaka, K', 'Kamada, N']","['Ge X', 'Tanaka K', 'Kamada N']",['Hospital of Nantong Medical College.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1996 Apr;109(4):300-3.,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 17 patients with APL (5 females and 12 males). Another 19 APL patients during relapse served as control. RNA extraction was obtained through the single-step method. By means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the PML-RAR alpha was detected in the sample mRNA. RESULTS: Nine out of 10 patients with complete remission (CR) duration shorter than 3 years were positive. Four cases became negative and three remained positive among 7 cases in a long remission of over 3 years. The difference of the positive rate of PML-RAR alpha transcripts between the 2 groups was significant (P < 0.05). Four among 12 positive cases relapsed. No evidence of relapse was present in the 5 negative patients after 9.6 +/- 3.9-month follow-up. Further treatment was therefore given to the 4 positive patients whose treatment was already ceased at that time. By this management they were all in CR during the following 10-month observation.

Meanwhile, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity and bone marrow CFU-L were also detected. RESULTS: Before treatment, there was an inhibitory activity on CFU-Meg in the serum of APL patients (29.6% +/- 2.4%). The activity reduced gradually with the treatment and was stimulus when bone marrow remission obtained (-18.7% +/- 4.1%, P < 0.001). It was positively correlated with TNF activity in the serum and the number of CFU-L however negatively correlated with the number of megakaryocyte in bone marrow and PLT. Serum TNF activity and the number of CFU-L before treatment were higher than those after treatment (P < 0.05 and < 0.001, respectively). ATRA could stimulate the growth of CFU-Meg.

METHODS: Data from two historical cohort studies of shoe workers were expanded and analysed in parallel. A total of 4215 shoemakers from England contributing 103 726 person-years at risk and 2008 shoemakers from Florence, Italy, contributing 54,395 person-years at risk were included in the analysis. Exposure to leather dusts and solvents from glues was evaluated on the basis of job title information. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated as ratios of observed deaths (Obs) over expected derived from national mortalities. RESULTS: Overall mortality was lower than expected in both cohorts (English cohort: Obs 3314, SMR 81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 78-84; Florence cohort: Obs 333, SMR 87, 95% CI 78-97). An increased risk of nasal cancer was found (English cohort: Obs 12, SMR 741; Florence cohort: Obs 1, SMR 909). 10 of the 13 cases occurred among English workers employed in the manufacture of welted boots (SMR 926, 95% CI 444-1703), a sector of the industry thought to have had the highest exposure to leather dust. Mortality from leukaemia was not increased in the English cohort (Obs 16, SMR 89), but was increased in the Florence cohort (Obs 8, SMR 214, 95% CI 92-421); and the highest risk was found among shoe workers in Florence who were first exposed between 1950 and 1959 when exposure to benzene was substantial (Obs 3, SMR 536, 95% CI 111-1566). Some evidence for an excess risk of stomach, bladder, and kidney cancer, as well as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was also found in the Florence cohort only among workers employed in jobs with the highest exposure to solvents. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the associations between exposure to leather dust and nasal cancer and between exposure to benzene and leukaemia in the shoe manufacturing industry and suggest that the risk of other cancers may be increased among workers exposed to solvents or glues.","['Fu, H', 'Demers, P A', 'Costantini, A S', 'Winter, P', 'Colin, D', 'Kogevinas, M', 'Boffetta, P']","['Fu H', 'Demers PA', 'Costantini AS', 'Winter P', 'Colin D', 'Kogevinas M', 'Boffetta P']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dust/adverse effects', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Nose Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Shoes', 'Solvents/adverse effects']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.53.6.394 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1996 Jun;53(6):394-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.53.6.394.,PMC1128495,"['0 (Dust)', '0 (Solvents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Micromagnetic separation of cell subsets, virus genome-specific PCR and flow cytometry were used to demonstrate the following sequence of events in infected animals: (i) very early replication of both 61E and 61C in CD4 T cells (provirus burden 0.2 to 1 copy/cell at 2-4 weeks post-infection); (ii) lower magnitude replication of both viruses in CD8 T cells and B cells during this initial phase of infection; (iii) plateauing of CD4 cell virus burden accompanied by escalation in CD8 and B cell provirus burdens after 4 weeks; (iv) extensive infection of haemopoietic and circulating myeloid cells. FeLV-FAIDS 61E and 61C replication kinetics and lymphocyte tropisms were similar in blood and lymph nodes, where provirus burdens ranged from 0.15 to 1.0 copy/cell. Moreover, virus infection was productive; 8-48 percent of blood lymphocytes, 35-81 percent of node lymphocytes and 53-98 percent of bone marrow cells expressed FeLV capsid antigen (p27 Gag).

FA presenting as AML is an exceptionally rare event and all previously described cases have occurred in patients less than 21 years of age. We conclude that the diagnosis of FA should always be considered in younger patients presenting with AML.

The Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that patients with low RB-1 expression had a lower probability of remaining in first remission (P = 0.03) and a significantly higher risk to succumb to their disease (P = 0.03). Furthermore, the comparison of the results between initial and relapsed ALL showed that the relapses had significantly lower RB-1 mRNA expression (P = 0.02). The overall survival of the patients was shorter in both groups when RB-1 gene expression was low. A multivariate analysis, including age, sex, immunological subtype, initial white blood cell count and RB-1 expression, identified RB-1 as an independent prognostic predictor (P = 0.017) in addition to the initial white blood cell count (P = 0.00001). In conclusion, low RB-1 expression is an unfavourable prognostic predictor in initial and relapsed childhood ALL. The RB-1 gene expression in relapsed ALL is significantly lower than in initial ALL.","['Sauerbrey, A', 'Stammler, G', 'Zintl, F', 'Volm, M']","['Sauerbrey A', 'Stammler G', 'Zintl F', 'Volm M']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics/metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1753.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jul;94(1):99-104. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1753.x.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Principal report of the Medical Research Council's AML9 study. MRC Leukaemia in Adults Working Party.,89-98,"Between 1984 and 1990, 972 patients aged 1-79 years with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), from 85 British hospitals, were entered into the MRC's 9th AML trial. Patients were randomized between DAT 1 + 5 (daunorubicin for 1 d, with cytarabine and 6-thioguanine for 5 d) and DAT 3 + 10 (same dose drugs for 3 and 10 d respectively) as induction therapy. The 63% who achieved complete remission (CR) were randomized to receive two courses of DAT 2 + 7 alternating with two courses of either MAZE (m-AMSA, 5-azacytidine, etoposide) or COAP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, cytarabine, prednisone). Finally, those still in CR were randomized to receive either 1 year of maintenance treatment with eight courses of cytarabine and thioguanine followed by four courses of COAP, or no further cytotoxic therapy. Resistance to induction therapy was less common with the DAT 3 + 10 regimen than with DAT 1 + 5 (13% v 23%; P = 0.0001) and hence, despite a 5% increase in the risk of induction death, the CR rate was higher (66% v 61%; P = 0.15). Moreover, CR was achieved more rapidly with DAT 3 + 10 (median 34 v 46 d; P < 0.0001) and thus patients required less time in hospital (mean 20 v 29 d) and less blood product support. 5-year relapse-free survival (28% v 23%; P = 0.05) and survival (23% v 18%; P < 0.05) were also better with DAT 3 + 10. Post-remission intensification of therapy with MAZE resulted in fewer relapses (66% v 74% at 5 years; P = 0.03) but patients allocated MAZE required considerably more supportive care and 14 (4.5%) died following 312 MAZE courses, whereas no deaths occurred following COAP. 5-year survival was not significantly higher with MAZE (37% v 31%). Finally, although 1 year of outpatient maintenance treatment appeared to delay, but not prevent, recurrence it did not improve 5-year survival which was non-significantly worse for those allocated maintenance treatment (41% v 44%). We conclude that the more intensive induction regimen, DAT 3 + 10, is not only more effective than DAT 1 + 5, even for older patients, but is also less expensive; intensive post-remission therapy with MAZE achieves better leukaemic control but at the cost of substantial toxicity; whereas low-level maintenance therapy confers no apparent advantage in survival as well as being inconvenient and costly.","['Rees, J K', 'Gray, R G', 'Wheatley, K']","['Rees JK', 'Gray RG', 'Wheatley K']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cytarabine/economics/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/economics/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/economics', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/economics/therapeutic use']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1769.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jul;94(1):89-98. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1769.x.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed a distinct peak of incidence in the first 2 years of life. Children with Down's syndrome accounted for 13% of all cases. Eighty of 105 cases treated on NOPHO-84 achieved remission (78%). In NOPHO-88, 100/118 patients entered remission (85%). The overall event-free survival (p-EFS) for the two studies was 0.32 for NOPHO-84 and 0.42 for NOPHO-88. The majority of relapses occurred within 2 years of diagnosis. When looking for prognostic factors the strongest significant adverse factor found was male sex.

The MRP mRNA levels were estimated by RT/PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) assay, and the protein levels by flow cytometry. 21 samples of peripheral blood and 21 samples of bone marrow (11 normal bone marrow donors, 10 patients in complete remission after chemotherapy for large cell lymphoma or acute myeloid leukaemia) were analysed. In peripheral blood the mean MRP mRNA level in CD3+ cells was statistically higher than in the other cells (3-fold by the methods used). The levels of MRP in CD3+ varied from one individual to another (4.5-34.8 units by RT/PCR and 5-23 grains/cell by ISH); however, this was proportional to the variation in all the cell lineages of same individual (r = 0.84). In bone marrow the mean MRP levels of the various cell lineages (including CD34+) were similar to the basal level in HL60 cells. Individual expression levels were again variable; however, there was no difference between untreated normal bone marrow and post chemotherapy normal bone marrow. MRP protein expression was determined by flow cytometry with the monoclonal antibody MRPm6. The CD4+ lymphocytes exhibited a higher MRP protein expression than the other cell lineages, including CD8+ cells.

It encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase of 210 kDalton, p210bcr/abl, which stimulates a variety of cytosolic signalling intermediates. The effects of bcr/abl on the activity of growth factor receptors are less well known. In order to investigate interaction of p210bcr/abl with the receptor tyrosine kinase p145c-kit, we used two myeloid, factor-dependent cell lines, MO7 and 32D, to generate bcr/abl positive sublines, MO7p210 and 32Dp210, by transfection with the bcr/abl gene. Since 32D and 32Dp210 cells did not express p145c-kit, a c-kit retrovirus was used to generate c-kit positive cell lines (32Dkit, 32Dp210kit). In contrast to MO7 and 32Dkit cells, MO7p210 and 32Dp210kit cells were factor independent and did not respond to the growth-promoting effects of recombinant human Steel factor (rhSF). Preincubation with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) neutralizing the binding of SF to p145c-kit did not affect the growth of MO7p210 cells, thus eliminating the possibility of an autocrine SF secretion. 32Dkit cells transfected with bcr/abl containing an inactivating point mutation (Lys-->Arg271) in the Abl kinase domain (32Dp210(Arg271)kit) retained their responsiveness to the effects of rhSF. Immune complex kinase assays showed that the kinase activity of p145c-kit was several-fold higher in MO7p210 and 32Dp210kit cells than in MO7, 32Dkit and 32Dp210(Arg271)kit cells, suggesting that Abl kinase activity was necessary to activate p145c-kit. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Kit and anti-Abl MAbs demonstrated that p145c-kit and p210bcr/abl were associated in an intracellular complex in human bcr/abl positive, c-kit positive cell lines (MO7p210; GM/SO). Finally, colony assays with bone marrow from bcr/abl positive CML patients showed that the haemopoietic progenitors of three of four patients did not respond to rhSF. Taken together, the results suggest that p145c-kit can be activated by p210bcr/abl via an Abl-kinase dependent mechanism involving the complex formation of both proteins. These findings could explain some clinical features (basophilia, increase of immature myeloid cells) of chronic-phase CML.","['Hallek, M', 'Danhauser-Riedl, S', 'Herbst, R', 'Warmuth, M', 'Winkler, A', 'Kolb, H J', 'Druker, B', 'Griffin, J D', 'Emmerich, B', 'Ullrich, A']","['Hallek M', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Herbst R', 'Warmuth M', 'Winkler A', 'Kolb HJ', 'Druker B', 'Griffin JD', 'Emmerich B', 'Ullrich A']","['Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum Innenstadt, Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.6102053.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jul;94(1):5-16. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.6102053.x.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

They have selective actions on peripheral blood cells, in that previous results indicate that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4) inhibit neutrophil migration while they are both potent stimuli of peripheral blood monocyte (PBM) chemotaxis and adherence. Here, we report the impact of lipoxins on levels of free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) in PBM and THP-1 cells (acute monocytic leukemia cells) as well as on the functional responses of these cells. LXA4, but not LXB4, induced a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in monocytes that was half-maximal at approximately 200 nM. Prior exposure of the cells to EGTA reduced the LXA4-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by approximately 50 to 60%, indicating the contribution of both intracellular mobilization and external influx in LXA4 Ca2+ regulation. A leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, ONO 4057, did not significantly alter LXA4-induced [Ca2+]i, while it inhibited the action of leukotriene B4. LXA4 also induced a rise in [Ca2+]i in the monocytic leukemia cell line (time to reach maximum = 15.1 +/- 0.87 s), and both LXA4 and LXB4 stimulated a concentration-dependent THP-1 cell adherence to laminin with concentrations as low as 10(-10)M. In contrast to the findings with LXA4, exposure of THP-1 or PBM to LXB4 was not accompanied by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Although both LXA4 and LXB4 stimulate adherence of PBM, they did not evoke superoxide anion generation by these cells, nor did they affect the rate of acidification of extracellular medium by monocytes, as monitored using a microphysiometer. Together, these results indicate that an increase in [Ca2+]i is a component of the signal transduction events following monocyte interaction with LXA4, but not LXB4, and that both LXA4 and LXB4 are potent and selective agonists for THP-1 cells and PBM. Moreover, they suggest that LX display a unique profile of actions with mononuclear cells compared with other known agonists of monocytes, and that LX can direct monocyte-mediated events.","['Romano, M', 'Maddox, J F', 'Serhan, C N']","['Romano M', 'Maddox JF', 'Serhan CN']","[""Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', '*Lipoxins', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Sep 1;157(5):2149-54.,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '92950-25-9 (lipoxin B4)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['GM-38765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK50305/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The pan-B Ag CD72 was recently identified as the CD5 counterstructure, and several data suggest the involvement of this ligand pair in T-B cell cognate interaction. However, the functional role of CD5 and CD72 molecules within the B cell compartment is still unknown. In this work we studied umbilical cord blood CD5+ B cells (B-1a), adult splenic CD5- B cells (B-2), and CD5+ B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Flow cytometry analysis and proliferation assays were used to determine 1) the ability of B-1a and B-2 cells to coexpress functionally relevant counterligands other than CD5 and CD72, and 2) the signaling capacity of CD5 and CD72 in terms of B cell activation and proliferation. To this purpose, freshly isolated or preactivated normal and neoplastic B cells were cultured with agonistic anti-CD5 or anti-CD72 mAbs in the presence or the absence of cytokines equipped with B cell activity. Our data demonstrate that CD5 and CD72 molecules are coexpressed with other ligand pairs usually involved in T-B cell cognate interaction on B-1a cells, but not on B-2 cells. CD5 and/or CD72 engagement delivers critical costimulatory signals in B-1a, B-2, and B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but with different requirements and patterns. Besides suggesting the potential involvement of B-1a lymphocytes in B-B cell interactions during T-independent B cell responses, our results indicate that CD5 and CD72 counterstructures play a functional role in the B cell compartment.","['Cerutti, A', 'Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Sancetta, R', 'Milani, A', 'Tassinari, C', 'Adami, F', 'Agostini, C', 'Semenzato, G']","['Cerutti A', 'Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Sancetta R', 'Milani A', 'Tassinari C', 'Adami F', 'Agostini C', 'Semenzato G']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Sep 1;157(5):1854-62.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CD72 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the effects of cyclosporin A (CSA) and FK-506, two potent immunosuppressive drugs, on SCF-dependent histamine release and growth of human MCs were analyzed. Preincubation of tissue MCs with CSA (3 micrograms/ml) resulted in inhibition of histamine release provoked by either recombinant human (rh) SCF (70.3% +/- 20.6% inhibition, p < 0.001) or anti-IgE (76.7% +/- 21.9%, p < 0.001) or by rhSCF+ anti-IgE (77.4% +/- 13.9%, p < 0.001).

IC50 values about three to 10 times higher were found for MCs preincubated with rhSCF before anti-IgE activation, compared with anti-IgE or SCF alone. SCF-dependent differentiation of human MCs was analyzed in a long-term suspension culture system (n = 6). Unexpectedly, CSA and FK-506 were unable to suppress, but even enhanced SCF-dependent growth of MCs and formation of MC tryptase in long-term culture. Together, CSA and FK-506 inhibit SCF-dependent release of histamine from human MCs and even augment SCF-dependent growth of human MCs in long-term culture.","['Sperr, W R', 'Agis, H', 'Czerwenka, K', 'Virgolini, I', 'Bankl, H C', 'Muller, M R', 'Zsebo, K', 'Lechner, K', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'Agis H', 'Czerwenka K', 'Virgolini I', 'Bankl HC', 'Muller MR', 'Zsebo K', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-6749(96)70163-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(96)70163-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1996 Aug;98(2):389-99. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(96)70163-x.,,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations of the 5q23-q31 interval are frequently observed in myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia. This strategy was thus undertaken to create a detailed genetic map of that region. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD50 (ScRAD50) is one of three yeast RAD52 epistasis group members (ScRAD50, ScMRE11, and ScXRS2) in which mutations eliminate meiotic recombination but confer a hyperrecombinational phenotype in mitotic cells. The yeast Rad50, Mre11, and Xrs2 proteins appear to act in a multiprotein complex, consistent with the observation that the corresponding mutants confer essentially identical phenotypes. In this report, we demonstrate that the human Rad50 and Mre11 proteins are stably associated in a protein complex which may include three other proteins. hRAD50 is expressed in all tissues examined, but mRNA levels are significantly higher in the testis. Other human RAD52 epistasis group homologs exhibit this expression pattern, suggesting the involvement of human RAD52 epistasis group proteins in meiotic recombination. Human RAD52 epistasis group proteins are highly conserved and act in protein complexes that are analogous to those of their yeast counterparts. These findings indicate that the function of the RAD52 epistasis group is conserved in human cells.","['Dolganov, G M', 'Maser, R S', 'Novikov, A', 'Tosto, L', 'Chong, S', 'Bressan, D A', 'Petrini, J H']","['Dolganov GM', 'Maser RS', 'Novikov A', 'Tosto L', 'Chong S', 'Bressan DA', 'Petrini JH']","['Human Genome Group, Genelabs Technologies, Inc., Redwood City, California 94063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Endodeoxyribonucleases', '*Exodeoxyribonucleases', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fungal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.9.4832 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Sep;16(9):4832-41. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.9.4832.,PMC231485,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (RAD50 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (RAD52 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (RAD52 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 protein, S cerevisiae)']",['5T32GM07133/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that YY1 can directly inhibit the activity of the IFN-gamma promoter by interacting with multiple sites in the promoter. In cotransfection assays, a YY1 expression vector significantly inhibited IFN-gamma promoter activity. Mutation of the YY1 binding site in the native IFN-gamma promoter was associated with an increase in the IFN-gamma promoter activity. Analysis of the DNA sequences of the IFN-gamma promoter revealed a second functional YY1 binding site (BED) that overlaps with an AP1 binding site. In this element, AP1 enhancer activity was suppressed by YY1. Since the nuclear level of YY1 does not change upon cell activation, our data support a model that the nuclear factor YY1 acts to suppress basal IFN-gamma transcription by interacting with the promoter at multiple DNA binding sites. This repression can occur through two mechanisms: (i) cooperation with an as-yet-unidentified AP2-like repressor protein and (ii) competition for DNA binding with the transactivating factor AP1.","['Ye, J', 'Cippitelli, M', 'Dorman, L', 'Ortaldo, J R', 'Young, H A']","['Ye J', 'Cippitelli M', 'Dorman L', 'Ortaldo JR', 'Young HA']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Developmental Center, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'YY1 Transcription Factor']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.9.4744 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Sep;16(9):4744-53. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.9.4744.,PMC231475,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We used provirus insertional mutagenesis in these mice to identify putative collaborators of c-myc. We found that Notch1 was mutated in a high proportion (52%) of these tumors. Proviruses were inserted upstream of the exon coding for the transmembrane domain and in both transcriptional orientations. These mutations led to high expression of truncated Notch1 RNAs and proteins (86-110 kD). In addition, many Notch1-rearranged tumors showed elevated levels of full-length Notch1 transcripts, whereas nearly all showed increased levels of full-length (330-kD) or close to full-length (280-kD) Notch1 proteins. The 5' end of the truncated RNAs were determined for some tumors by use of RT-PCR and 5' RACE techniques. Depending on the orientation of the proviruses, viral LTR or cryptic promoters appeared to be utilized, and coding potential began in most cases in the transmembrane domain. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the 330-kD Notch1 proteins were processed into 110- and 280-kD cleavage products. These results suggest that Notch1 can be a frequent collaborator of c-myc for oncogenesis. Furthermore, our data indicate that Notch1 alleles mutated by provirus insertion can lead to increased expression of truncated and full-length (330/280-kD) Notch1 proteins, both being produced in a cleaved and uncleaved form.","['Girard, L', 'Hanna, Z', 'Beaulieu, N', 'Hoemann, C D', 'Simard, C', 'Kozak, C A', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Girard L', 'Hanna Z', 'Beaulieu N', 'Hoemann CD', 'Simard C', 'Kozak CA', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, myc', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'RNA/chemistry', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Thymoma/*genetics/pathology/virology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.10.15.1930 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1996 Aug 1;10(15):1930-44. doi: 10.1101/gad.10.15.1930.,,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells also present high capacities to differentiate in vitro into various cell types including cells from ectodermic, mesodermic and endodermic lineages.

It was applied to detect minimal residual disease. A sensitive and specific technique to detect minimal residual disease for T-cell malignancies was explored. Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the rearranged V-D-J segment of T-cell receptor delta (TCR delta) gene from malignant cell specimens of patients with leukemia and lymphoma of T-cell lineage. The PCR product was sequenced and from the DNA sequences of the V-D-J region, a 3' anti-sense primer was designed and synthesized for clonal specific PCR (CS-PCR). T-cell receptor delta (TCR-delta) gene rearrangement was studied in 40 cases of acute leukaemia and lymphoma of T-cell lineage at diagnosis. Using Southern analysis, the positive rates were 28 and 32% for the 18 T-lymphoma and 22 T-ALL, respectively. A one stage Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique was used to detect the rearrangement in Southern positive cases and the PCR positive rates were 80 and 86%, respectively. The PCR technique had a sensitivity of 0.1%. Serial follow-up marrow specimens were available from 4 T-ALL patients following chemotherapy for monitoring of minimal residual disease. Their PCR products were DNA sequenced. A 3' primer was designed for each case for a clonal specific (CS) PCR. The technique had a sensitivity of 0.003%. It was applied to detect minimal residual disease in serial follow-up marrow samples. The first patient had persistent negative CS-PCR results and enjoyed continuous remission for more than 3 years. The second patient with negative one stage PCR but positive CS-PCR results had eventual relapse of leukaemia. The other two patients never achieved a morphological remission. These preliminary results appeared to support the usefulness of these PCR techniques in detecting minimal residual disease and predicting relapses for ALL.

Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that stimulation of chemotaxis, fluid pinocytosis, and actin polymerization of CML PMNL in response to a synthetic chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) is significantly lower than that in normal PMNL. It is not known whether this lower response of CML PMNL to fMLP is a global phenomenon involving different chemoattractant receptors or is restricted to the fMLP pathway. We have evaluated chemoattractant induced degranulation process in normal and CML PMNL to fMLP, platelet activating factor (PAF), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and an analogue of fMLP viz formyl-methionine-1 aminocyclooctane 1 carboxylic acid-phenylalanine-O-methionine (FACC8) using release of lysozyme as a parameter. We find that after stimulation with fMLP and FACC8, the mean percent release of lysozyme was significantly lower in CML PMNL as compared to that in normal cells (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two after stimulation with PAF and LTB4. The results indicate that the fMLP pathway is suppressed in CML granulocytes whereas PAF and LTB4 pathways appear unaltered in these cells. We therefore also studied the kinetics of peptide-receptor interaction with a labelled hexapeptide fNLPNTL which binds to the fMLP receptor. Our results show that the number of fMLP receptors/cell is significantly lower in CML PMNL (P < 0.05) than in normal PMNL, while their affinity constants and dissociation constants were comparable.","['Radhika, V', 'Thennarasu, S', 'Naik, N R', 'Kumar, A', 'Advani, S H', 'Bhisey, A N']","['Radhika V', 'Thennarasu S', 'Naik NR', 'Kumar A', 'Advani SH', 'Bhisey AN']","['Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Chemotactic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Leukotriene B4/pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/metabolism', 'Reference Values']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199607)52:3<155::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199607)52:3<155::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-S [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Jul;52(3):155-64. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199607)52:3<155::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-S.,,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '71901-21-8 (F-chemotactic peptide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this communication we describe an unusual patient with typical chronic phase Ph positive CML and evidence of the uncharacteristic mbcr1 breakpoint, predicting expression of the ALL-type p190 fusion protein. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated BCR gene rearrangement, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detected the BCR-ABL fusion mRNA characteristic of the mbcr1 breakpoint, and failed to detect BCR-ABL mRNA characteristic of the Mbcr1 breakpoint. Southern blot analysis revealed no rearrangement in Mbcr1, and direct sequencing of the PCR product confirmed it to be the ALL-type mbcr1 fusion mRNA with the first exon of the BCR gene fused to ABL exon a2.

However, we show here that the chronic myelogenous leukemia oncogene Bcr/Abl has positive effects on VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrin function. The presence of Bcr/Abl in the GM-CSF- or IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell lines MO7e, 32D, and BaF/3 enhanced cell binding to both soluble and immobilized fibronectin. The effect was due to enhanced function of the VLA-5 integrin fibronectin receptor and not to increased surface expression. In parallel, Bcr/Abl stimulated cell adhesion to the VLA-4 integrin ligand VCAM-1. Stimulation of VLA-5 function directly correlated with induction of Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity in a temperature-sensitive kinase mutant.

In vitro experiments have shown that the CLL cells can be induced to differentiate into cells that secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) and can occasionally undergo heavy (H) chain class switching. We now show that the CLL cells also undergo isotype-switching in vivo, since gamma and/or alpha H chain transcripts with identical FW3/CDR3/FW4 regions as the mu CLL transcripts were detected in all of the 13 investigated patients with IgM+ CLL. In most cases switching had occurred to alpha1 and gamma3, but CLL transcripts corresponding to the other gamma chain isotypes were also detected. In one case both the productively and nonproductively rearranged allele were found to undergo H chain class switching. CLL gamma transcripts were also present in surface IgG+ sorted B cells, demonstrating that a small subset of the CLL cells express membrane IgG. In addition, transcripts encoding secretary gamma2 and gamma3 H chains were detected in two cases, which suggests that some serum IgG could be produced by the leukemic clone. Analysis of sorted PBL showed that isotype-switching occurs in CLL cells that express the CD5 antigen. Finally, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the mu, alpha, and gamma CLL transcripts are identical, demonstrating that the CLL cells do not accumulate somatic mutations in their variable region genes after the H chain class switching. These data provide in vivo evidence that isotype-switching is a frequent phenomenon in CLL, and indicate that a subset of the CLL lymphocytes progress to later stages of B cell differentiation.","['Efremov, D G', 'Ivanovski, M', 'Batista, F D', 'Pozzato, G', 'Burrone, O R']","['Efremov DG', 'Ivanovski M', 'Batista FD', 'Pozzato G', 'Burrone OR']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Area Science Park, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Primers', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118792 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Jul 15;98(2):290-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI118792.,PMC507430,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether the induction of apoptosis caused by anti-Fas mAb may play a potential role as a new therapeutic strategy for RA, we investigated the effect of anti-Fas mAb (RK-8) on synovitis in an animal model of RA, the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) tax transgenic mice. We report here that administration of anti-Fas mAb into mice intra-articularly improved the paw swelling and arthritis within 48 h. Immunohistochemical study and in vitro culture studies showed that 35% of synovial fibroblasts, 75% of mononuclear cells, and some of polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltrating in synovium underwent apoptosis by anti-Fas mAb. In situ nick end labeling analysis and electron microscope analysis clearly showed that many cells in synovium were induced apoptosis by anti-Fas mAb administration. However, local administration of anti-Fas mAb did not produce systemic side effects. Results demonstrated that administration of anti-Fas mAb in arthritic joints of the HTLV-1 tax transgenic mice produced improvement of arthritis.

This yields a fusion transcript, PML/RARalpha, a transcription factor with reported dominant negative functions in the absence of hormone. Clinical remissions induced with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia are linked to PML/RARalpha expression in leukemic cells. To evaluate the PML/RARalpha role in myelopoiesis, transgenic mice expressing PML/RARalpha were engineered. A full-length PML/RARalpha cDNA driven by the CD11b promoter was expressed in transgenic mice. Expression was confirmed in the bone marrow with a reverse transcription PCR assay. Basal total white blood cell and granulocyte counts did not appreciably differ between PML/RARalpha transgenic and control mice. Cell sorter analysis of CD11b+ bone marrow cells revealed similar CD11b+ populations in transgenic and control mice. However, in vitro clonal growth assays performed on peripheral blood from transgenic versus control mice revealed a marked reduction of myeloid progenitors, especially in those responding to granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and kit ligand cotreatment did not overcome this inhibition. Impaired myelopoiesis in vivo was shown by stressing these mice with sublethal irradiation. Following irradiation, PML/RARalpha transgenic mice, as compared with controls, more rapidly depressed peripheral white blood cell and granulocyte counts. As expected, nearly all control mice (94.4%) survived irradiation, yet this irradiation was lethal to 45.8% of PML/RARalpha transgenic mice. Lethality was associated with more severe leukopenia in transgenic versus control mice. Retinoic acid treatment of irradiated PML/RARalpha mice enhanced granulocyte recovery. These data suggest that abnormal myelopoiesis due to PML/RARalpha expression is an early event in oncogenic transformation.","['Early, E', 'Moore, M A', 'Kakizuka, A', 'Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Martin, P', 'Evans, R M', 'Dmitrovsky, E']","['Early E', 'Moore MA', 'Kakizuka A', 'Nason-Burchenal K', 'Martin P', 'Evans RM', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Medicine, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/07/23 00:00,1996/07/23 00:01,['1996/07/23 00:00'],"['1996/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.15.7900 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jul 23;93(15):7900-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.15.7900.,PMC38846,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['1F32CA61646-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-62275-02/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the past, transgenic technology in zebrafish has been limited by the relatively low efficiency with which transgenes could be generated using either DNA microinjection or retroviral infection. Previous efforts to generate transgenic zebrafish with retroviral vectors used a pseudotyped virus with a genome based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus and the envelope protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus. This virus was injected into blastula-stage zebrafish, and 16% of the injected embryos transmitted proviral insertions to their offspring, with most founders transmitting a single insertion to approximately 2% of their progeny. In an effort to improve this transgenic frequency, we have generated pseudotyped viral stocks of two new Moloney-based genomes. These viral stocks have titers up to two orders of magnitude higher than that used previously. Injection of these viruses resulted in a dramatic increase in transgenic efficiency; over three different experiments, 83% (110/133) of the injected embryos transmitted proviral insertions to 24% of their offspring. Furthermore, founders made with one of the viruses transmitted an average of 11 different insertions through their germ line. These results represent a 50- to 100-fold improvement in the efficiency of generating transgenic zebrafish, making it now feasible for a single lab to rapidly generate tens to hundreds of thousands of transgenes. Consequently, large-scale insertional mutagenesis strategies, previously limited to invertebrates, may now be possible in a vertebrate.","['Gaiano, N', 'Allende, M', 'Amsterdam, A', 'Kawakami, K', 'Hopkins, N']","['Gaiano N', 'Allende M', 'Amsterdam A', 'Kawakami K', 'Hopkins N']","['Center for Cancer Research and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genome, Viral', 'Mice', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1996/07/23 00:00,1996/07/23 00:01,['1996/07/23 00:00'],"['1996/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.15.7777 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jul 23;93(15):7777-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.15.7777.,PMC38824,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']","['CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD07818-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Structural and numerical changes typical of most pathological entities can be detected using chromosome-specific probes on interphase or metaphase cells by means of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this report we present chromosome analysis combining conventional cytogenetics with ISH in 121 patients affected with different haematological diseases. We have studied 92 patients with B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD), 11 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 17 acute nonlymphocytic leukaemias (ANLL), 1 acute lymphocytic leukaemia and 1 aplastic anaemia. The ISH was carried out with two kind of biotin-labeled probes: a) 8 and 12 centromeric alpha satellite probes and b) whole painting chromosome (WPC) library probes from all the chromosomes except numbers 10, 16, 21, X and Y. RESULTS: The cytogenetic analysis of B-CLPD has been hampered by several problems. These leukaemic cells have very low spontaneous mitotic activity and the cell response to mitogens is often poor, unpredictable and variable. Even so, an extra chromosome 12 (+ 12) is one of the most frequent abnormal karyotypes reported. ISH and chromosome 12 specific biotinylated alpha satellite DNA probe was applied in 84 patients with B-CLPD. Among 50 patients with typical chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) the ISH studies showed two signals of hybridization in the 50 cases. By conventional cytogenetics 9 out of 18 atypical CLL showed chromosomal abnormalities and 7 of them trisomy 12. ISH detected trisomy 12 in 11 of these cases. Trisomy 8 is the most frequent karyotypic change in MDS and ANLL. Cytogenetic results revealed a clear extra copy of chromosome 8 in 13 cases. In all of these trisomic cases, the presence of trisomy 8 clone was confirmed by ISH. ISH revealed trisomy 8 not detected by conventional cytogenetics in 7 cases. The yield of trisomy is much higher with the ISH technique than with conventional cytogenetics. Finally, conventional cytogenetics combined with CISS (chromosomal in situ suppression) hybridization was performed in 15 patients affected with different haematological diseases showing structural aberrations, complex karyotypes or marker chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that ISH can detect both numerical and structural chromosome changes with high specificity and reliability.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January and June of 1995, 64 samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) cytapheresis were studied. There were 58 APL samples (23 patients: 10 samples obtained with disease activity, 43 samples in complete remission (CR) and 5 PBSC samples) and 6 control samples, of non-APL hematological neoplasms (3 other AML, 1 CML, 1 ALL, and 1 MDS). On the RNA obtained from the isolated mononuclear cells of each sample a conserved region of the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene was amplified by using a RT-PCR with specific primers. RESULTS: The sensitivity assays were performed by diluting PML/RAR alpha positive RNA samples into RNA of controls. The RT-PCR assay was capable to detect the PML/RAR alpha until an 1/1000 dilution in negative control RNA. Nine out of 58 APL samples failed in the amplification of the control gene, and were considered non-evaluable. None of the 6 control samples showed PML/RAR alpha rearrangement. Nine out of 10 APL samples with disease activity were positive for the presence of PML/RAR alpha (the non-positive sample was a non-evaluable one). Six out of 43 APL samples in CR showed the rearrangement, 3 of them corresponding to 2 patients who posteriory relapsed 12 and 19 months after 1st CR. The other 3 positive samples came from other 3 APL patients (24 months in 3rd CR, 14 months in 1st CR and early CR), who remained in CR at the end of the study. No relapse could be noted in patients with negative PCR samples. PML/RAR alpha was not found in any of the 5 APL PBSC samples studied. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-PCR method described here seems to be highly specific as it only detects this rearrangement in LPA patients. Furthermore, the presence of PML/RAR alpha in CR patients could be related to relapse. For all these reasons, this molecular method shows great usefulness and can be advocated, not only for assessing diagnosis, but for as monitoring minimal residual disease in the post remission follow up.","['Barragan, E', 'Bonanad, S', 'Lopez, J A', 'Martin, G', 'Martinez, J', 'Sanz, G F', 'Gomis, F', 'Perez, M L', 'Senent, M L', 'Larrea, L', 'Bolufer, P', 'Sanz, M A']","['Barragan E', 'Bonanad S', 'Lopez JA', 'Martin G', 'Martinez J', 'Sanz GF', 'Gomis F', 'Perez ML', 'Senent ML', 'Larrea L', 'Bolufer P', 'Sanz MA']","['Departamento de Biopatologia Clinica, Hospital Universitario La Fe Valencia.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1996 Jun;41(3):189-94.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,Deteccion del reordenamiento PML/RAR alpha en la leucemia promielocitica aguda mediante un metodo de PCR reversa.,,,,,,,,,

Evidence supporting this hypothesis is twofold. First, NGFI-A antisense oligonucleotides prevent macrophage differentiation in HL-60 and U937 myeloid leukemia cell lines and in normal bone marrow cells. Second, enforced expression of NGFI-A blocks granulocytic differentiation and promotes macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells and in the hematopoietic progenitor cell line 32D. We sought to determine the effect of NGFI-A deficiency on macrophage differentiation and function in vivo by examining native bone marrow cells from mice homozygous for a disrupted allele of NGFI-A derived from gene-targeted ES cells. Macrophages were observed in peripheral blood and several tissues, indicating that NGFI-A was not required for the formation of a variety of macrophage compartments. No differences in myeloid cell differentiation were observed between wild-type and NGFI-A-/- bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of macrophage, granulocyte-macrophage, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, GM-CSF, or G-CSF). Activation of NGFI-A-/- macrophages was comparable to that of wild-type macrophages as determined by nitric oxide production and increased cell surface expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. Moreover, NGFI-A-/- mice showed no increased mortality or bacteria] burden when challenged with Listeria monocytogenes.

We have previously identified a 305-bp fragment within the FVIII cDNA that is involved in the repression (R.C. Hoeben, F.J. Fallaux, S.J. Cramer, D.J.M. van den Wollenberg, H. van Ormondt, E. Briet, and A.J. van der Eb, Blood 85:2447-2454, 1995). Here, we show that this 305-bp region of FVIII cDNA contains sequences that resemble the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) autonomously replicating sequence consensus. Two of these DNA elements coincide with AT-rich sequences that are often found in matrix attachment regions or scaffold-attached regions. One of these elements, consisting of nucleotides 1569 to 1600 of the FVIII cDNA (nucleotide numbering is according to the system of Wood et al. (W.I. Wood, D.J. Capon, C.C. Simonsen, D.L. Eaton, J.

A synthetic heptamer of this segment can repress the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and also loses this capacity upon mutation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that repression by FVIII sequences can be relieved by sodium butyrate. We demonstrate that the synthetic heptamer (FVIII nucleotides 1569 to 1600), when placed upstream of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat promoter that drives the CAT reporter, can render the CAT reporter inducible by butyrate. This effect was absent when the same element was mutated. The stimulatory effect of butyrate could not be attributed to butyrate-responsive elements in the studied long terminal repeat promoters. Our data provide a functional characterization of the sequences that repress expression of the FVIII cDNA.

Here, this Rex sequence is shown to function also as a protein nuclear export signal (NES). Rex sequence libraries containing randomized forms of the activation domain/NES were screened for retention of the ability to bind Rab/hRIP by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. While the selected sequences differed widely in primary sequence, all were functional as Rex activation domains. In contrast, randomized sequences that failed to bind Rab/hRIP lacked Rex activity. The selected sequences included one with homology to the Rev activation domain/NES and a second that was similar to the NES found in the cellular protein kinase inhibitor alpha. A highly variant, yet fully active, activation domain sequence selected on the basis of Rab/hRIP binding retained full NES function even though this sequence preserved only a single leucine residue. In contrast, nonfunctional activation domain mutants that were unable to bind Rab/hRIP had also lost NES function. These data demonstrate that NES activity is a defining characteristic of the activation domains found in the Rev/Rex class of retroviral regulatory proteins and strongly support the hypothesis that the Rab/hRIP cofactor plays a critical role in mediating the biological activity of these NESs.

The mechanism of TEL-mediated transformation, however, is unknown. We report the cloning and characterization of a chromosomal translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia which fuses TEL to the ABL tyrosine kinase. The TEL-ABL fusion confers growth factor-independent growth to the marine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 and transforms Rat-1 fibroblasts and primary murine bone marrow cells. TEL-ABL is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and localizes to the cytoskeleton. A TEL-ABL mutant containing an ABL kinase-inactivating mutation is not constitutively phosphorylated and is nontransforming but retains cytoskeletal localization. However, constitutive phosphorylation, cytoskeletal localization, and transformation are all dependent upon a highly conserved region of TEL termed the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. TEL-ABL formed HLH-dependent homo-oligomers in vitro, a process critical for tyrosine kinase activation. These experiments suggest that oligomerization of TEL-ABL mediated by the TEL HLH domain is required for tyrosine kinase activation, cytoskeletal localization, and transformation. These data also suggest that oligomerization of Ets proteins through the highly conserved HLH domain may represent a previously unrecognized phenomenon.","['Golub, T R', 'Goga, A', 'Barker, G F', 'Afar, D E', 'McLaughlin, J', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Rowley, J D', 'Witte, O N', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Golub TR', 'Goga A', 'Barker GF', 'Afar DE', 'McLaughlin J', 'Bohlander SK', 'Rowley JD', 'Witte ON', 'Gilliland DG']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.8.4107 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Aug;16(8):4107-16. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.8.4107.,PMC231407,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']","['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 53867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We found that DMSO, an agent inducing differentiation in K-562 cells, is capable of regulating the composition of alpha-RNA population and concomitantly changes the content of mRNA that has regions homologous (complementary) to alpha-RNA. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that DMSO decreases the level of alpha-RNA, which hybridizes with the actin gene. Results of restriction mapping of regions of complementary interaction of alpha-RNA with the actin gene point out that alpha-RNA hybridizes with regions containing the promotor area and 3'-nontranslated area of the gene.

We report our experience with fludarabine in patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies that were previously treated with conventional agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were studied. Eleven had CLL and nine NHL. Among the patients with CLL and NHL, 72 and 100%, respectively, had advanced disease. All patients had previously been treated. Fludarabine was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 25 mg/m2, for 5 days every 4 weeks until a maximum of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Neither complete response (CR) nor partial response (PR) was recorded in patients with CLL; 4 (36%) achieved clinical improvement. Among the 9 patients with NHL, 3 (33%) had a CR and one a PR; two of the 3 patients with CR also achieved a molecular remission. In 3 patients with CLL their disease progressed from stage II to IV. Three patients (one with CLL and two with NHL) developed high-grade lymphoma during or immediately after the treatment with fludarabine. The major toxicities were infections: 3 patients had lobar pneumonia and one an interstitial pneumonia without microbiological identification. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine is an active agent in patients with low-grade lymphoid malignancies refractory to the treatment or in relapse. The possibility of obtaining molecular remissions makes this agent specially interesting in those therapies including hemopoietic progenitors transplantation as intensification treatment.","['Briones, J', 'Montserrat, E', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Esteve, J', 'Colomer, D', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Bosch, F', 'Hadjieu, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Briones J', 'Montserrat E', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Esteve J', 'Colomer D', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Bosch F', 'Hadjieu E', 'Rozman C']","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras Valenti, Departamento de Medicina, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Universidad de Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1996 Jun 15;107(3):86-9.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,Tratamiento con fludarabina de neoplasias linfoides de bajo grado de malignidad resistentes al tratamiento o en recaida.,,,,,,,,,

G-CSF protein was neither produced during PMA-induced differentiation nor in response to retinoic acid (RA) alone. However, when combined, PMA and RA synergistically stimulated G-CSF production with optimal effect observed at 10(-7)M for both PMA and RA. The synergistic interaction between PMA and RA on G-CSF production appeared to be mediated primarily through production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) since neutralization of IL-1 beta activity inhibited about 80% of G-CSF production. It has been previously reported that IL-1 potently synergizes with RA to stimulate G-CSF production by THP-1 cells pretreated with PMA Using synthetic ligands to RA receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) that selectively bind and activate RAR-RXR and RXR-RXR dimers respectively, we showed that the ability of RA to synergize with IL-1 was signaled through RAR-RXR heterodimer pathway.

GPI-linked proteins are involved in signal transduction mediated by members of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) family. Therefore we studied associated molecules providing the signaling capacity of CD24. Lysates of SW2 and K562 cells were analysed for expression of PTK of the c-src family by Western blotting. We identified c-fgr in SW2 lysates and c-fgr and also lyn in K562 lysates. To study a putative association of these PTK with CD24 we performed immunoprecipitations with the mAb SWA11 directed against CD24. Western analysis of the precipitates showed an association of c-fgr with CD24 in SW2 cells and lyn in K562 cells. We conclude that either c-fgr or lyn is physically associated with CD24 in a cell-type depending manner. An involvement of these complexes in signaling phenomenons of CD24 in small cell lung cancer and in leukaemias is discussed.,"['Zarn, J A', 'Zimmermann, S M', 'Pass, M K', 'Waibel, R', 'Stahel, R A']","['Zarn JA', 'Zimmermann SM', 'Pass MK', 'Waibel R', 'Stahel RA']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",1996/08/14 00:00,1996/08/14 00:01,['1996/08/14 00:00'],"['1996/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)91184-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.1184 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Aug 14;225(2):384-91. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1184.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (proto-oncogene proteins c-fgr)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty patients with B-cell malignancies that had progressed despite intensive chemotherapy and who had a significant number of malignant cells in their bone marrow were treated with multiple 0.7-3.7 GBq/m2 (18-100 mCi/m2) intravenous infusions of Lym-1, a murine monoclonal antibody that binds to a tumour-associated antigen, labeled with iodine-131. Granulocyte and platelet counts were measured in order to assess bone marrow toxicity. BEDs were calculated according to the formula: BED=D(1+gD/(alpha/beta))-0.693(Tn-Tk)/alphaTp, where D represents the absorbed dose of radiation delivered to the red marrow by penetrating emissions of 131I throughout the whole body and nonpenetrating emissions of 131I in the blood and bone marrow, g is a factor that depends on the duration of irradiation relative to the repair half-life of human bone marrow, alpha is the coefficient of nonrepairable damage per Gy, beta is the coefficient of repairable damage per Gy2, Tn is the time required to reach the granulocyte or platelet count nadir after an 131I-Lym-1 infusion, Tk is the time at which bone marrow proliferation begins after the start of treatment and Tp is the doubling time of the bone marrow after the granulocyte or platelet count nadir has been reached. The cumulative 131I-Lym-1 radioactivity administered to each patient was calculated. Biologically effective doses from multiple 131I-Lym-1 infusions were summated in order to arrive at a total BED for each patient. There was a weak association between granulocyte and platelet counts and radioactivity (the correlation coefficients were -0.23 and -0.60, respectively). Likewise, there was a weak association between granulocyte and platelet counts and BED (the correlation coefficients were -0.27 and -0.40, respectively). The attempt to take bone marrow absorbed doses and overall treatment time into consideration with the linear-quadratic model did not produce a stronger association than was observed between peripheral blood counts and administered radioactivity. The association between granulocyte and platelet counts and BED may have been weakened by several factors, including variable bone marrow reserve at the start of 131I-Lym-1 therapy and the delivery of heterogeneous absorbed doses of radiation to the bone marrow.","['Wilder, R B', 'DeNardo, G L', 'Sheri, S', 'Fowler, J F', 'Wessels, B W', 'DeNardo, S J']","['Wilder RB', 'DeNardo GL', 'Sheri S', 'Fowler JF', 'Wessels BW', 'DeNardo SJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med,European journal of nuclear medicine,7606882,IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*etiology', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Linear Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology', 'Time Factors']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01084370 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med. 1996 Aug;23(8):953-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01084370.,,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],['CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The children consisted of 1 boy and 5 girls, from 3 to 12 years old, 3 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 with malignant lymphoma. Four patients received induction treatment that included intravenous administration of L-asparaginase and/or intrathecal administration of methotrexate. One patient received induction treatment and consolidation treatment that included intravenous administration of L-asparaginase. One patient received induction and consolidation treatment, and the protocol for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Laboratory examinations revealed coagulation dysfunction in 3 patients treated with L-asparaginase and 1 patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5-T unit, using spin-echo or fast spin-echo sequences. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted images were obtained in the axial and/or coronal plane (section thickness, 4 mm; inter-section gap, 2 mm). MRI was initially performed within 36 hours after the onset in all patients, and follow-up MRIs were performed for 6 months. MRI showed lesions involving the cortex and subcortex in 4 patients with coagulation dysfunction. In 2 of these 4 patients, Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images showed contrast enhancement in the surface of the gyrus, suggesting focal vascular stasis. Serial MRI revealed nearly complete resolution of the lesions. Symptoms were relieved in every case. The lesions on MRI were presumed to be due to venous thrombosis related to the coagulation dysfunction caused by L-asparaginase or DIC. On the other hand, in 2 patients with onset after intrathecal administration of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine, MRI revealed multiple lesions involving the centrum semiovale and periventricular white matter. No Gd-enhancement of the lesion was detected. This MRI finding was consistent with leukoencephalopathy. As time passed, the symptoms improved completely, and the lesions became better demarcated.

However, it is unknown what gene products provide the death signal to the sensitized PBT cells and how activated Mo enable PBT cells to become susceptible to apoptosis. Here, we show that PBT cells, but not Mo, express functional Fas ligand upon treatment with PMA. Moreover, this Mo-dependent T cell apoptosis could be blocked by a Fas-Ig fusion protein, as well as by a nonlytic mAb against Fas molecule. These results strongly suggest involvement of Fas-Fas ligand interaction in the death of PBT cells. Unlike Fas-induced apoptosis, however, Mo-dependent T cell death was completely inhibited by overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein, and PMA alone was sufficient to trigger apoptosis in T cells when Mo were included in culture. Furthermore, anti-CD11a, anti-CD18, or anti-CD45/CD45RA mAbs; could prevent PBT cells from death triggered by PMA plus Mo, suggesting that these Ags participate in the apoptotic process. The participation of CD45RA in the death of PBT cells was further demonstrated by the observation that the J45.01 cell line, a CD45-deficient variant of Jurkat cells, did not undergo apoptosis by this Mo-dependent mechanism. When transfected with cDNA encoding CD45RA, J45.01 cells acquired apoptotic response to PMA stimulation in the presence of Mo to a similar, but lesser, degree than normal Jurkat cells.","['Wu, M X', 'Ao, Z', 'Hegen, M', 'Morimoto, C', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Wu MX', 'Ao Z', 'Hegen M', 'Morimoto C', 'Schlossman SF']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD18 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/physiology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jul 15;157(2):707-13.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['AI12069/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

By labeling with bromodeoxyuridine in vivo, we found vigorous CD4 T cell proliferation during the initial stages of infection, yet a loss in their ability to function both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, a significant fraction of the CD4 T cell population in infected mice undergoes spontaneous apoptosis in vivo. Upon in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 plus PMA, anergic CD4 T cells from mice with MAIDS fail to progress through the cell cycle (G0/G1 arrest), and a fraction of the cells undergoes apoptosis. The addition of IL-2 along with TCR-mediated stimulation not only fails to rescue CD4 T cells from apoptosis, but enhances activation-induced cell death. To further understand the regulation of the suicide pathway(s) of anergic CD4 T cells vs the cytokine synthesis pathway(s) of normal CD4 T cells, we evaluated their expression of Bcl-2 protein. As infection progresses, the expression of Bcl-2 among CD4 T cells declines and drops further when CD4 T cells are restimulated through the TCR in vitro. These results suggest that this CD4 T cell immunodeficiency in MAIDS includes a TCR-induced program of activation-induced cell death and an uncoupling from cytokine synthesis pathways and proliferation of CD4 T cells. The decline in Bcl-2 expression may be in part responsible for this reprogramming.","['Muralidhar, G', 'Koch, S', 'Broome, H E', 'Swain, S L']","['Muralidhar G', 'Koch S', 'Broome HE', 'Swain SL']","['Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', '*Clonal Anergy/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jul 15;157(2):625-35.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']","['CA56290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although restriction is not absolute, Fv1 prevents or delays spontaneous or experimentally induced viral tumours. In vitro, Fv1 restriction leads to an apparent 50-1,000 fold reduction in viral titre. Genetic evidence implicates a direct interaction between the Fv1 gene product and a component of the viral preintegration complex, the capsid protein CA (refs 7-9).

The availability of receptor-specific synthetic retinoids that can induce distinct receptor functions has potential in extending the therapeutic repertoire of retinoids.","['Chen, J Y', 'Clifford, J', 'Zusi, C', 'Starrett, J', 'Tortolani, D', 'Ostrowski, J', 'Reczek, P R', 'Chambon, P', 'Gronemeyer, H']","['Chen JY', 'Clifford J', 'Zusi C', 'Starrett J', 'Tortolani D', 'Ostrowski J', 'Reczek PR', 'Chambon P', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM/ULP, College de France, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/08/29 00:00,1996/08/29 00:01,['1996/08/29 00:00'],"['1996/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/382819a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1996 Aug 29;382(6594):819-22. doi: 10.1038/382819a0.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate a tight correlation between protection of HL60 cells from apoptosis-associated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by specific protease inhibitors or protein phosphatase inhibitors, with early tyrosine phosphorylation of a single protein substrate with a molecular weight of approximately 42,000. Exposure to protease inhibitors that did not protect HL60 cells from DNA fragmentation did not result in phosphorylation of this substrate. Likewise, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor that did not interfere with specific phosphorylation did not prevent DNA fragmentation.

To distinguish between the dominant-negative effect and gain of new function of p53 missense mutants, we measured the ability of transfected missense mutant p53s in p53-null Jurkat cells to alter T-cell receptor (TCR) surface expression. The TCR is a key signal transduction moiety common to T lymphocytes and is one of the major sites for aberrations in T-cell leukemias/lymphomas. Three p53 mutants (248trp, 249ser, and 273his) enhanced the frequency of TCR mutants after graded doses of X-radiation compared to null p53 parent- and wild-type p53-possessing normal lymphocytes; the parent Jurkat and normal lymphocyte showed no difference. These enhancements were not the results of a change in radiosensitivity or in G1 checkpoint arrest characteristics. Therefore, the creation of this mutator phenotype by missense-type p53 mutations implies that a more direct mechanism, apart from changes of cell cycle kinetics or cell death, may be responsible for the selection of certain p53 point mutations, which eventually result in the tumorigenesis of the cell.","['Iwamoto, K S', 'Mizuno, T', 'Ito, T', 'Tsuyama, N', 'Kyoizumi, S', 'Seyama, T']","['Iwamoto KS', 'Mizuno T', 'Ito T', 'Tsuyama N', 'Kyoizumi S', 'Seyama T']","['Department of Radiobiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Drug Stability', 'Genes, p53/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Lymphocytes/physiology/radiation effects/ultrastructure', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Sep 1;56(17):3862-5.,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MTBE did not show any mutagenic potential in the Ames bacterial assay or any clastogenicity in cytogenetic tests. However, it has been shown to be mutagenic in an in vitro gene mutation assay using mouse lymphoma cells when tested in the presence, but not in the absence, of a rat liver-derived metabolic activation system (S-9). In the present study, MTBE was tested to determine if formaldehyde, in the presence of the S-9, was responsible for the observed mutagenicity. A modification of the mouse lymphoma assay was employed which permits determination of whether a suspect material is mutagenic because it contains or is metabolized to formaldehyde. In the modified assay, the enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) and its co-factor, NAD+ are added in large excess during the exposure period so that any formaldehyde produced in the system is rapidly converted to formic acid which is not genotoxic. An MTBE dose-responsive increase in the frequency of mutants and in cytotoxicity occurred without FDH present, and this effect was greatly reduced in the presence of FDH NAD+. The findings clearly demonstrate that formaldehyde derived from MTBE is responsible for mutagenicity of MTBE in the activated mouse lymphoma assay. Furthermore, the results suggest that the lack of mutagenicity/clastogenicity seen with MTBE in other in vitro assays might have resulted from inadequacies in the test systems employed for those assays.","['Mackerer, C R', 'Angelosanto, F A', 'Blackburn, G R', 'Schreiner, C A']","['Mackerer CR', 'Angelosanto FA', 'Blackburn GR', 'Schreiner CA']","['Stonybrook Laboratories Inc., Princeton, New Jersey 08543, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

This phenomenon has occasionally been implicated in the emergence of clonal subpopulations during the course of acute lymphoblastic leukemia; it has also been found in murine precursor B cell lines. V gene replacement has never been described in lymphoproliferative disorders corresponding to more differentiated stages of B cell ontogeny. The present communication provides evidence for the operation of the same mechanism in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Genomic DNA and total cellular RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a 48-year-old female patient diagnosed as having typical B-CLL were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification aiming to detect rearranged clonal heavy and light chain variable genes (VH and VL, respectively). PCR consistently gave two VH amplification products, both at the DNA and the RNA level; similar analysis for the VL region revealed the presence of a single rearranged VK gene. Direct sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed that, except for a number of silent mutations, the single rearranged VK gene was identical to the germline A1-A17 VK gene. The two rearranged VH gene segments belong to the VHl and VHIII gene families and are closely homologous, respectively, to the germline gene segments V1-18 and V3-30, which have been shown to be used by autoantibodies. Both rearranged VH genes showed identical in-frame D-N-JH junctions and JH gene usage (JH5b), whereas the VH-N-D junctions were different. The above findings indicate that, during the course of the disease of our patient, VH gene replacement took place giving rise to two different clonally related subpopulations. This raises the intriguing possibility that the recombinase machinery, which governs Ig recombinatorial processes, might be operative even at more advanced stages in B cell ontogeny.","['Stamatopoulos, K', 'Kosmas, C', 'Stavroyianni, N', 'Loukopoulos, D']","['Stamatopoulos K', 'Kosmas C', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Loukopoulos D']","['First Department of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, University of Athens School of Medicine, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1551-6.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Taken together, our data suggest that the Ph1-positive Z-33 ALL cells produce GM-CSF, express GM-CSF receptors, and show an autocrine proliferative response to this cytokine.","['Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Ku, S', 'Harris, D', 'LaPushin, R', 'Koller, C A', 'Hirsh-Ginsberg, C', 'Huh, Y', 'Yee, G', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Ku S', 'Harris D', 'LaPushin R', 'Koller CA', 'Hirsh-Ginsberg C', 'Huh Y', 'Yee G', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1534-43.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",['P01 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) is of particular importance, since its triggering may induce apoptosis in sensitive cells. Recently, a soluble form of the CD95 molecule was described which interacts with the CD95-CD95 ligand death pathway. Increased concentrations of soluble CD95 (sCD95) were previously detected in some patients with T and B cell leukemias and lymphomas. In the present study we investigated sCD95 in the serum of patients with myeloid leukemias, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes. A total of 72 patients was studied (29 AML, 17 MDS, 20 CML and six other myeloproliferative disorders). In AML with active disease, the levels of sCD95 tended to be elevated, but did not correlate with defined clinical or laboratory parameters. In the other disorders, the levels of sCD95 were not generally increased, although some patients had elevated levels. These data strongly suggest that sCD95 in AML patients is not derived from leukemic cells, but is possibly secreted or shed from reactive or stromal cells. This hypothesis is also supported by a group of eight patients with septicemia but not leukemia who had elevated sCD95 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, all three patients with elevated sCD95 who had undergone chemotherapy for AML had major infections. Taken together, this study shows that measuring soluble Fas-receptor in myeloid leukemia is not diagnostically useful, but increased sCD95 may be associated with clinical complications like septicemias.","['Munker, R', 'Midis, G', 'Owen-Schaub, L', 'Andreff, M']","['Munker R', 'Midis G', 'Owen-Schaub L', 'Andreff M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Hepatitis B/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Reference Values', 'Sepsis/blood', 'Solubility', 'fas Receptor/*blood']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1531-3.,,['0 (fas Receptor)'],"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

MMP activity is tightly controlled by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). We found the leukemic cell line HL-60 constitutively to release a 94-kDa gelatinase which we identified as MMP-9 shortened by nine amino acids at its N-terminal end. An additional gelatinolytic activity was present in small amounts and identified as a 63-kDa fragment of MMP-9 generated by autocatalytical processing. Both enzymes were identical regarding their N-terminus, indicating C-terminal truncation for the former. Incubation of cells with phorbol ester resulted in elevated amounts of both enzymes in conditioned media and in the secretion of TIMP-1. Both gelatinases were shown to be activated by trypsin and organomercurials and to possess similar activities towards various substrates. However, the 63-kDa enzyme differed from the 94-kDa enzyme in a significantly reduced inhibition by recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Thus, the 63-kDa fragment of MMP-9 once activated may escape the regulatory influence of its specific inhibitors and may thereby promote matrix degradation during invasion of leukemic cells.","['Ries, C', 'Lottspeich, F', 'Dittmann, K H', 'Petrides, P E']","['Ries C', 'Lottspeich F', 'Dittmann KH', 'Petrides PE']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Munich Medical School, Grosshadern, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycoproteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', '*Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1520-6.,,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, the serum levels of the serum complement proteins C1q, C1r, C1s, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, Factor B and properdin were repeatedly evaluated by means of radial immunodiffusion assay in 26 CLL patients over a period of 2 years. At the time of diagnosis, 18 of the 26 CLL patients showed low serum levels in at least one of these complement proteins as compared to a group of sex- and age-matched healthy subjects (P < 0.0001). Complement defects affected either the classical and/or the alternative pathway components, and in some case low levels of late components (C5-C9) were also observed. A reduced level of properdin was the most frequent abnormality (11/18). The presence of such abnormalities were correlated with the stage of the disease, and they were found in 100% of the patients (11) in advanced stages (Rai II-IV), and in 40% of patients (15) in early stages (0-1) (P < 0.004). Severe infections occurred in five patients; four of them were in advanced stages of the disease and had decreased levels of at least one complement component, whereas the remaining patient was in an early stage and had normal levels of complement components. These data support the notion that an impaired complement system might be involved in the pathophysiology of CLL and its infectious complications. Although more work is needed to sustain this hypothesis, we discuss the possibility on the basis of data obtained in the first-degree relatives of CLL patients, that in some CLL patients the complement deficit might reflect a genetic predisposition.","['Schlesinger, M', 'Broman, I', 'Lugassy, G']","['Schlesinger M', 'Broman I', 'Lugassy G']","['Institute of Immunology, Barzilai Medical Center, Ashkelon, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/blood', 'Autoimmunity/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pseudomonas Infections/blood/immunology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/blood/immunology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1509-13.,,['9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)'],,,,,,['Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):635-6.

The frequency of LOH at a given locus was usually < 10% and fractional allelic loss, calculated as the ratio of chromosomal arms displaying loss among all informative arms for each patient, ranged from 0.025 to 0.31 (mean, 0.063). This study provides further evidence that deletional events are a major type of genetic alteration found in childhood ALL. The diversity of the loci displaying LOH suggests that, as in solid tumors, numerous tumor suppressor genes are likely to participate in leukemogenesis. However, the overall low frequency of LOH, as well as the absence of microsatellite instability suggest that the genetic instability is lower in childhood ALL than in most of the solid tumors.","['Cave, H', 'Guidal, C', 'Elion, J', 'Vilmer, E', 'Grandchamp, B']","['Cave H', 'Guidal C', 'Elion J', 'Vilmer E', 'Grandchamp B']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie Genetique, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Alleles', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/genetics', 'Diploidy', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Markers', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Telomere']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1486-91.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

BM cells from nine patients (six diagnosis samples and three relapse samples) were intravenously injected into SCID mice (three mice for each patient). All mice injected with cells from four patients developed a leukemia-like illness 12-40 weeks after injection. By PCR, new subclones that were the result of ongoing IgH rearrangement according to the mechanism operative in the injected cell populations (VH-replacement or VH to D-JH joining) were detected in the engrafted cell populations for all four patients. Subclones were mouse-specific, suggesting that subclone formation is a continuous process. Southern analysis after engraftment was unaltered as compared to the injected cells for one patient and revealed changes indicative of altered clonal composition for three patients. For two patients the observed changes possibly reflect the initial engraftment of a limited number of cells and occurred without changes in other parameters of the engrafted cell population, such as time needed for the development of leukemia, macroscopic organ involvement, immunophenotype and S-phase fraction. In one patient, we demonstrated the selective outgrowth of only a single cell type present at diagnosis, as characterized by IgH rearrangements. Our data show that evolution of clonal IgH rearrangements in B-precursor ALL may occur without the selective pressure of chemotherapy.

TEL/AML1 transcripts were found in 14 patients (13%) including three relapsed patients, and were unexceptionally limited to B-lineage ALL patients. The incidence of TEL/AML1 transcripts among B-lineage ALL was 16% (14/86). The reciprocal AML1/TEL transcripts were detected in 12 (86%) of the 14 cases expressing a TEL/AML1 transcript. In three cases, the TEL gene was fused to exon 3 of the AML1 gene, and to exon 2 in the remaining cases. To evaluate the amount of TEL/AML1 molecules for the quantification of a minimal residual disease (MRD), a plasmid vector which contained either a long TEL/AML1 PCR product (464 bp) or a short one (425 bp) was used as a competitor. We amplified RNAs obtained from bone marrow (BM) at complete remission or from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests in two representative cases. For one PBSC harvest showing a positive result, a competitive PCR was carried out to quantify the amount of MRD. A 1:4 dilution series of competitor vectors was constructed, and each vector was added to a PCR reaction which contain a constant amount of cDNA obtained from the PBSC harvest. An equivalent point was compared to that of corresponding samples at diagnosis. Using this method, MRD in the PBSC harvest was 3.9:10(3). Our results elucidated the incidence, lineage-specificity, and variant forms of TEL/AML1 fusion transcripts in childhood ALL. Since the percentage of other chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL is not more than 5%, TEL/AML1 transcript would be the most feasible clone-specific marker for these patients. In addition, our method could be a powerful tool for quantification of the TEL/AML1 transcript and for the detection of MRD.","['Nakao, M', 'Yokota, S', 'Horiike, S', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Kashima, K', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Koizumi, S', 'Takaue, Y', 'Matsushita, T', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Misawa, S']","['Nakao M', 'Yokota S', 'Horiike S', 'Taniwaki M', 'Kashima K', 'Sonoda Y', 'Koizumi S', 'Takaue Y', 'Matsushita T', 'Fujimoto T', 'Misawa S']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1463-70.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological actions elicited by KL are initiated by binding to its cognate receptor, c-kit, which is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase. The resulting ligand/receptor complex rapidly activates the intrinsic kit receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of specific intracellular substrates that are involved in downstream signaling events. In the present studies, we demonstrate that KL stimulates the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene, c-Cbl, in two KL-responsive human hematopoietic cell lines, MO7e and TF-1. In both these cell lines we found a constitutive in vivo association between c-Cbl and the adaptor protein Grb2 and demonstrate (in vitro) that c-Cbl binds primarily to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of this association was not significantly affected upon c-kit receptor activation. We also provide evidence that c-Cbl is not stably associated with the kit receptor either prior to or following KL stimulation.

The fate of any T cell, whether it is developing in the thymus, or functioning in the peripheral immune system, is dependent on T cell receptor (TCR) specificity for antigens presented by MHC molecules and on the consequences of TCR-generated intracellular signalling pathways which lead to activation, anergy or apoptosis. This review describes data that have elucidated the way in which these highly regulated TCR-derived signalling pathways lead to such diverse final outcomes in thymocytes. Contributions to the induction of apoptosis in thymocytes by signalling pathways and receptors such as Fas, CD45 and CD28 are summarized, particularly with regard to the analysis of relevant transgenic mice. Developments concerning regulation of apoptosis by bcl-2 family members and the possible effectors of apoptosis, proteases, are assessed. Finally, this information is contrasted with the relatively scarce data on signalling pathways in thymic-derived T-ALL cells together with potential explanations of how transformation might occur by perturbation of apoptotic mechanisms.

Survival and proliferation of leukemic cells appears to be influenced, at least in vitro, by several cytokines. Among the different hematopoietic cell lineages, megakaryocytopoiesis represents a complex and unique hematopoietic system that is thought to be supported by some well-known cytokines; however, the hypothetical lineage-specific main regulator of platelet production, termed thrombopoietin (TPO) had remained elusive. Recently, characterization of the proto-oncogene c-mpl revealed structural homology with the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily, specific expression on cells of the megakaryocytic lineage and functional involvement in megakaryocytopoiesis. Several groups purified and cloned the MPL ligand. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the MPL ligand has activity in stimulating both megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production proving that this ligand is the long-sought growth factor TPO itself. The MPL receptor was found at the mRNA and/or protein level in 40-80% of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases in various series. MPL expression was not limited to certain morphological FAB types, although the highest percentages were seen in the M6 (erythroid) and M7 (megakaryocytic) subclasses. Among the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), MPL expression was detected in one third of the cases, in particular in refractory anemia with excess of blasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Lymphoid malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and myeloma were MPL-negative. Among the large panel of human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines studied, MPL expression occurred predominantly in lines with erythro-megakaryocytic phenotypes. Nearly all primary and continuously cultured non-hematopoietic solid tumor samples were negative for MPL expression. A significant portion of AML cases and of erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid leukemia cell lines co-expressed TPO and MPL mRNA transcripts, although no biologically active TPO appeared to be secreted by these cells. In several studies TPO induced in vitro proliferation of 14-37% of primary AML cases, predominantly of the M2 and M7 subtypes. TPO significantly enhanced the cytokine-induced growth of AML cells in a substantial fraction of cases responsive to GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6 or SCF. While none of 30 growth factor-independent erythro-megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines responded to TPO with increased proliferation, TPO strongly augmented the growth of several constitutively cytokine-dependent cell lines (eg HU-3, M-07e, TF-1) which can be made TPO-dependent and used as bioassays. Neither in primary cells nor in cell lines did TPO appear to induce any signs of morphological, functional or immunological differentiation. Expression of the MPL receptor is not correlated with a proliferative response to TPO. In summary, extensive studies on normal human and animal cells demonstrated the specificity and function of the MPL receptor and proved that its ligand TPO is the major physiological regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis. The data reviewed here document the wide expression of the MPL receptor on AML cells and also suggest some proliferative effects on certain leukemia cells, apparently on non-megakaryocytic AML cells as well. Thus, experimental evidence supports the notion that TPO may contribute, at least in part, to leukemogenesis, especially in combination with other hematopoietic cytokines which is of clinical significance. TPO-responsive cell lines represent powerful tools for such analyses.","['Drexler, H G', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Sep;10(9):1405-21.,,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,136,,,,,,,,

The in vitro growth of L1210 is completely inhibited by 10(-8) M CT, while WEHI-3B growth shows the same inhibition at 10(-11) M. The analysis of membrane ganglioside pattern of the two cell lines shows that in L1210 cells the major component is the GM1a ganglioside while the monosialogangl oside fraction from WEHI-3B is entirely composed of gangliosides of the 'b' series among which GM1b is the more represented. The total cholera toxin binding capacity of the ganglioside extract from L1210 cells is more than hundred fold higher than that of WEHI-3B and this difference is also confirmed by the number of CT receptors/cell and by the binding of FITC-B subunit of CT on the cells. These surprising data are in conflict with the poor sensitivity to CT evidenced by L1210 compared to WEHI-3B cells. In order to clarify this discrepancy we investigated the cAMP accumulation, the cell viability and the clonogenicity of these two leukemia cell lines following the treatment with CT and forskolin (FRSK). The treatment of WEHI-3B cells with CT induces a dramatic increase of intracellular cAMP which highly correlates with cell death and the decrease of clonogenicity and this result is partially obtained by the treatment with FRSK. L1210 cells do not evidence significant cAMP accumulation neither with CT nor with FRSK treatment. These data suggest that the different inhibiting effect of CT on WEHI-3B and L1210 cells does not correlate with their different pattern of gangliosides and the related toxin binding capacity. Further they indicate that the growth inhibition of WEHI-3B cells is closely related with a cAMP-dependent cell killing mechanism, while the inhibition of L1210 growth (produced by high concentration of CT) is mediated by a cAMP independent mechanism.","['Giuliani, A', 'Calappi, E', 'Mineo, E', 'Neri, M G', 'Gallina, A', 'Pessina, A']","['Giuliani A', 'Calappi E', 'Mineo E', 'Neri MG', 'Gallina A', 'Pessina A']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Gangliosides/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/22 00:00,1995/11/22 00:01,['1995/11/22 00:00'],"['1995/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01076072 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1995 Nov 22;152(2):103-12. doi: 10.1007/BF01076072.,,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival curves showed that after induction of remission, relapses were less frequent during the first 2 years for patients with CD34+ B-lineage ALL. After 2 years, however, event-free survival curves of CD34+ and CD34- patients merged.

Tissue samples from 36 patients stained strongly for CD30, and of these, 22 showed anaplastic morphology. Patients with CD30-positive DLCL presented more frequently with skin involvement, constitutional symptoms, more advanced Ann Arbor stage disease, and at a younger age when compared to patients with CD30-negative DLCL. Both groups had a similar complete response rate (78%). Patients with CD30-positive DLCL had a favorable survival rate when compared to patients with CD30-negative DLCL, although the difference was not statistically significant (73% vs. 55%, p = 0.28). Among the CD30-positive DLCL patients, those with anaplastic morphology presented more frequently with extranodal disease and T-cell phenotype when compared to patients with non-anaplastic morphology, but both groups had similar rates of complete response and long-term survival. All 107 patients were treated initially with a doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen.

Since these ODNs are designed to be CML cell specific, we studied their effects on the human CML cell line K562, which is known to have B3A2 rearrangement, and leukemic cells from patients, as well as normal hematopoietic stem cells in vitro. In vitro experiments were performed to determine a potential role of these two ODNs as ex vivo purging agents. Incubation of B3A2 antisense at 40, 80, and 120 micrograms/ml with K562 CML cells for 72 hours at 37 degrees C resulted in 44%, 56%, and 63% reduction of CFU-L as compared to controls. In contrast, B3A2 sense and B2A2 antisense had no significant growth inhibitory effect on K562 cells. Incubation of B3A2 and B2A2 antisense ODNs at concentration of 80 micrograms/ml at 37 degrees C for 36 hours with normal peripheral blood stem/progenitor cells (PBSC) resulted in 124% and 98% CFU-GM formation as compared to untreated controls, respectively. However, incubation of PBSC with B3A2 and B2A2 sense-ODNs resulted in a 22% and 44% reduction in CFU-GM, respectively. In order to determine the ex vivo purging effects of bcr-abl ODNs, the K562 cells were mixed with PBSC from normal donors at a ratio of 1:20 (CML:PBSC). The mixture of cells was then incubated with B3A2 antisense at 80 micrograms/ml for 36 hrs at 37 degrees C. After incubation, no CML cells were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as compared to untreated controls. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR using bcr-abl primers and mRNA isolated from the mixture of cells. Further, these results support the hypothesis that bcr-abl antisense ODNs are potentially effective agents for ex vivo purging of autologous stem cells before transplantation to eliminate/reduce the burden of leukemic cells. No significant toxicity to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell population by the bcr-abl antisense ODNs was observed.

Ten of 66 Ly+ AML and only one of 44 AML cases without this coexpression exhibited TCR delta gene rearrangements (p = .028). In contrast, no correlation was observed between terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression and the occurrence of TCR delta gene rearrangements in AML. Rearrangements were found in two of 25 AML with and seven of 71 AML cases without TdT expression. Interestingly, nucleotide sequencing of junctional sites revealed up to 36 N-nucleotides in cases without or with only weak TdT expression indicating downregulation of TdT expression after the TCR rearrangement took place. Complete V delta 1J delta 1 and incomplete D delta 2J delta 1 gene rearrangements were observed most frequently in Ly+ AML.

The genetic dissection of leukemic myelopoiesis may provide new perspectives for the control of myeloid leukemias. Based on their expression of phenotypic markers (e.g., surface antigens, cytochemical staining, etc.), myeloid cell lines can be further subdivided into myelogenous, monocytic, erythroid and megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines. Due to the close relationship of erythroid and megakaryoblastic progenitor cells and to the existence of a probably common precursor cell giving rise to these two different cell lineages, many megakaryoblastic cell lines express erythroid markers (e.g., expression of hemoglobin or glycophorin A) and conversely cell lines with a predominant erythroid profile might display megakaryoblastic features (e.g., platelets peroxidase or glycoproteins CD41, CD42b or CD61). The recent cloning of the specific cytokine: thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor generated a strong interest in these particular myeloid cell lines that are discussed in more detail in the present review. Both normal and leukemic megakaryocytopoiesis are stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, GM-CSF/IL-3 fusion protein, IL-6, IL-11 and TPO but inhibited by IL-4, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines have common biological features: high expression of the megakaryocytic specific antigen (CD41); high expression of early myeloid antigens (CD34, CD33 and CD13); constitutive expression of IL-6 and platelet-derived growth factor; a complex karyotype picture; expression of c-kit (the stem cell factor receptor); growth-dependency or -stimulation by IL-3 and/or GM-CSF; and in vivo tumorigenicity in mice associated with marked fibrosis. Whereas numerous chemical and biologic agents induce granulocytic and/or monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines, only a few agents including phorbol myristate acetate, vitamin D3, IFN-alpha, IL-6 and thrombin have been reported to induce megakaryocytic differentiation in the megakaryoblastic leukemia cells.","['Hassan, H T', 'Drexler, H G']","['Hassan HT', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Hannover Medical School, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509054748 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Dec;20(1-2):1-15. doi: 10.3109/10428199509054748.,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukins)']",,,,196,,,,,,,,

Patients were studied at two time periods (> 3 months and > 24 months post-BMT). All but two patients were conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (CY). One patient received busulfan (Bu), thiothepa (Thio) and CY, another patient CY and Bu. Detection of MRD occurred exclusively among patients with a MC (significance P < 0.04). Six of 18 patients with MC had detectable MRD, four of these consecutively developed cytogenetic and hematological relapse. Of 28 patients studied more than 3 months post-transplant, 18 (64%) had mixed chimerism and 10 (36%) had exclusively donor-derived blood cells. Nineteen patients were followed for their chimeric status between 24 months and 136 months post-BMT. Four patients converted from MC to complete chimerism and 10 patients (53%) remained mixed chimeric. The high incidence of MC in patients who underwent BMT without T cell depletion was measured by using a PCR assay with a sensitivity of 0.001%. As previously described by other investigators patients with complete chimerism developed more acute GVHD grade I-II (seven of 10 patients (70%) than patients with MC (nine of 18 patients (50%), not significant). This study also suggests that chimeric status might depend upon the regimen to prevent GVHD. One of four patients who received weekly methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis developed MC, whereas in 11 of 18 patients receiving short course methotrexate and cyclosporine MC was detectable.

To maximize the number of stem cells infused, a large volume (1-1.51) of marrow was harvested from the donors. After immunopurging, the marrow infused contained a median of 3.7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, 1.4 x 10(6) CD3+ cells/kg, and 1.6 x 10(6) CD5+ cells/kg as assessed by flow cytometry.

Five of nine evaluable patients developed chronic GVHD. Two patients relapsed, but the most common cause of death was infection with or without chronic GVHD. Four patients survive 10+ to 27+ months post-transplant. XZ-CD5 is well-tolerated in T cell-depleted marrow transplant recipients. However, partial T cell depletion and intensive post-transplant immunosuppression did not prevent moderate acute GVHD or chronic GVHD.

The genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR), DEK involved in a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the folate-sensitive fragile site FRA6A, have already been mapped to 6p23. Recent linkage data have suggested evidence for a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia in the region. We have constructed a single YAC contig of approximately 100 clones spanning the entire 6p23 band from 6p22.3 to 6p24.1 and covering 7.5-8.5 Mb of DNA. The YAC contig contains 55 markers including genetically mapped STSs, physically mapped STSs, anonymous STSs, anonymous ESTs, and ESTs from the genes mapped to the region. The order of the genetically mapped STSs is consistent with their order in the contig and some of the markers not resolved on the genetic map have been resolved by the YACs. Four of the YACs from 6p23 and covering approximately 3 Mb of DNA have been used to isolate approximately 300 cosmids from a flow-sorted human chromosome 6 cosmid library, which have been organized into pockets. The proposed susceptibility locus for schizophrenia is most closely linked to D6S260, which is located within the YAC contig along with genetic markers < or = 5 cM on either side.

This seemingly paradoxical finding is explained by the more rapid reduction of the leukaemic cell mass and the faster restoration of normal haematopoesis. In the most recent study on double induction therapy by the German AML Cooperative Group involving 665 adult patients with AML the rate of complete remission was 66%-73%. Haematopoietic growth factors used as part of the anti-tumour regimen offer a number of advantages. These include acceleration of haematopoietic recovery and the potential to enhance the sensitivity of leukaemic blasts when given prior to and during cytostatic therapy.

The CALGB initiated an adjuvant breast cancer trial in 1985 to determine if dose intensification (dose of drug per unit time) of chemotherapy was related to relapse-free and overall survival. Patients were randomized by pretreatment clinical variables to one of three different dosage regimens of chemotherapy. Using a tumor enrichment procedure, 442 paraffin-embedded blocks were analyzed by flow cytometry, and S-phase fraction (SPF) was analyzed by three different methods. Ploidy analysis was performed using standard procedures. Tissue from 90% of the patients was suitable for ploidy analysis, whereas only 68% could be assessed for SPF. With a median follow-up time of 80 months, our results show that ploidy status had no clinical utility, whereas high SPF predicted poorer overall survival. The rectangular fit model for SPF was more predictive of outcome than both the area fit model and a computer fit model (modfit) for SPF. In univariate analysis, patients with a low SPF (< 10%) had a better prognosis than those patients with a high SPF (> 10%), but they responded equally well to the different treatment regimens. Patients with high SPF (> 10%) had longer relapse-free and overall survival to high dose chemotherapy compared to low or standard dose chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis indicated that treatment intensity as well as the number of positive nodes, tumor size, steroid receptor status, and c-erb B-2 expression were significant in predicting overall and disease-free survival. The multivariate analysis, however, revealed that SPF was significant in predicting overall but not disease-free survival, but there was no longer any relationship among SPF, dose intensity, and outcome.","['Kute, T E', 'Quadri, Y', 'Muss, H', 'Zbieranski, N', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Berry, D A', 'Barcos, M', 'Thor, A P', 'Liu, E', 'Koerner, F']","['Kute TE', 'Quadri Y', 'Muss H', 'Zbieranski N', 'Cirrincione C', 'Berry DA', 'Barcos M', 'Thor AP', 'Liu E', 'Koerner F', 'et al.']","['Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Ploidies', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'S Phase/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990220406 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Dec 15;22(4):297-306. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990220406.,,,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The survey consisted of 12 questions about the flow cytometry procedures used by the laboratory in evaluating leukemias and lymphomas and on the format and content of their official report. It also requested an example of a typical leukemia/lymphoma report and solicited write-in comments about additional important aspects of using flow cytometry to evaluate leukemia and lymphomas not covered by the questionnaire. The goal of the survey, which was sponsored by the Clinical Cytometry Society (CCS), was to document what directors of flow cytometry laboratories currently consider to be the appropriate contents of a clinical leukemia/lymphoma phenotyping analysis and in what manner and detail they report such flow cytometry results to clinicians. The survey indicated that a large number of markers are routinely evaluated to phenotype leukemias (mean = 19) and lymphomas (mean = 16). Light scatter gating, using CD45/14 to monitor the gate selected, is currently employed by a 2:1 ratio over the next most population gating strategy (CD45 vs. 90 degrees LS). Peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissue constitute the majority of clinical specimens evaluated for leukemia and/or lymphoma. Two-color analysis, primarily for surface markers, is currently the standard method for flow cytometry measurements in routine diagnostic studies of leukemia and lymphoma. The official flow cytometry laboratory report is most commonly an individual-lab-generated, paper report form. A discussion of the potential benefits that might result from the development of improved computerized reporting software and from the increased use of antibody-defined, lineage gating is offered. A composite report format is presented that demonstrates the flow measurements and quality control data included in the best of the example clinical reports submitted as part of the survey and considered important by a majority of our survey respondents. The example report is intended to be a basis for further discussion within the flow cytometry community on whether minimum reporting standards for leukemia and/or lymphoma flow cytometry results can and should be developed.","['Hassett, J', 'Parker, J']","['Hassett J', 'Parker J']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Data Collection', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Specimen Handling', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990220403 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Dec 15;22(4):264-81; discussion 330. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990220403.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether the distribution of these proteins depends on environmental conditions and whether ND10 correlate with nuclear bodies. Certain nuclear bodies and ND10 react in a similar way and share antigens. Interferon exposure doubled the number of ND10 and increased the frequency of nuclear bodies, whereas herpes simplex virus infection or heat shock modify both. Redistribution of ND10-associated proteins to hundreds of small sites throughout the chromatin was inducible by stress in the form of heat shock and exposure to Cd++ ions. The change of distribution was rapid and independent of protein synthesis, and thus not part of the classical heat shock response. The very rapid redistribution of these proteins after heat shock, together with the development of ND10 upon interferon activation, raises the possibility that ND10 represent storage sites of certain matrix proteins readily accessible throughout the chromatin in response to stress or other effectors that induce global nuclear changes.","['Maul, G G', 'Yu, E', 'Ishov, A M', 'Epstein, A L']","['Maul GG', 'Yu E', 'Ishov AM', 'Epstein AL']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/drug effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Stress, Physiological/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240590410 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1995 Dec;59(4):498-513. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240590410.,,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The 4-3 hydrophobic repeat is located in the transmembrane subunit (TM) of the retroviral envelope protein, adjacent to the fusion peptide, a region that inserts into the host bilayer during the membrane-fusion process. A 4-3 hydrophobic repeat region in an analogous position of the influenza hemagglutinin protein is recruited to extend a three-stranded coiled coil during the conformational change to the fusion-competent state. To determine the conformation of the retroviral TM subunit and the role of the 4-3 hydrophobic repeat, we constructed soluble peptide models of the envelope protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV). RESULTS: The region of the MMLV TM protein external to the lipid envelope (the ectodomain) contains a stably folded, trimeric, protease-resistant core. As predicted, an alpha-helical segment spans the 4-3 repeat. A cysteine-rich region carboxy-terminal to the 4-3 repeat confers a dramatic increase in stability and displays a unique disulfide bonding pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the MMLV TM subunit can fold into a stable and distinct species in the absence of the receptor-binding 'surface' co-subunit (SU) of the envelope complex. As the SU subunit is readily shed from the surface of the virus, we conclude that the TM subunit structure forms the core of the MMLV membrane-fusion machinery, and that this structure, like the fusion-active conformation of influenza hemagglutinin, contains a three-stranded coiled coil adjacent to the fusion peptide.","['Fass, D', 'Kim, P S']","['Fass D', 'Kim PS']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Disulfides', 'Hemagglutinins, Viral/chemistry', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(95)00275-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00275-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1995 Dec 1;5(12):1377-83. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00275-2.,,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Hemagglutinins, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of two variants of the K562 cell line in different stages of differentiation showed different patterns of expression of the MAGE-1 gene. The more undifferentiated cell line (K562A) expressed high levels of specific MAGE-1 mRNA, in contrast to K562B, which features of erythroid differentiation, without MAGE-1 expression.

Such an effect is not observed with HL-60 cells.

On the basis of these data, it appears that biochemical indices are not sufficiently reliable in the nutritional assessment of bone marrow transplantation patients because the levels of these substances are markedly affected by the acute-phase response secondary to febrile episodes and graft-versus-host disease, which frequently complicate transplantation.","['Muscaritoli, M', 'Conversano, L', 'Cangiano, C', 'Capria, S', 'Laviano, A', 'Arcese, W', 'Rossi Fanelli, F']","['Muscaritoli M', 'Conversano L', 'Cangiano C', 'Capria S', 'Laviano A', 'Arcese W', 'Rossi Fanelli F']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthropometry', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Ceruloplasmin/metabolism', 'Complement C3c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', '*Nutritional Status', '*Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Prealbumin/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nutrition. 1995 Sep-Oct;11(5):433-6.,,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Prealbumin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '80295-44-9 (Complement C3c)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of radioiodine must conform to regulations and definitions laid down by ARSAC And POPUMET. Medical staff authorising therapy must hold an ARSAC licence. The recommended strategy is to give an activity sufficient to render the patient rapidly euthyroid and maintain that state or achieve no more than a low rate of hypothyroidism in subsequent years. A range of activity (300-800 MBq) is suggested depending on the clinical state. Antithyroid drugs may be given before or after (or both) radioiodine if necessary. Full written information should be given to the patient and written consent obtained. A structured follow-up should be used ensuring regular measurement of TSH or FT4.

When murine or human peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells are incubated with IL-2 in vitro for 24 hours, cytotoxic T-cells are generated. If these activated cells are infused into mice, the enhanced cytotoxicity continues if low dose IL-2 is administered. This combination of administering activated cells with the subsequent low dose IL-2 infusion results in enhanced tumor cell destruction and improved survival rates in mice with acute myeloid leukemia. The encouraging results of these laboratory experiments prompted the initiation of phase I clinical trials in patients with refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies and patients with breast cancer (Stages II-IV). Results from these trials demonstrate that stem cell transplantation with IL-2 activated stem cells (either PB or BM) with or without parenteral administration of IL-2 results in hematopoietic reconstitution with mild-to-moderate toxicities. This regimen also generates cutaneous and visceral autologous graft versus host disease (AuGVHD). The majority of our patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies or breast cancer developed either clinical and/or histological evidence of AuGVHD. Further studies are being conducted to determine if patients who develop AuGVHD experience improved disease-free survival from a possible autologous graft versus tumor (GVT) effect.

Ex vivo purification of normal CD34+ cell subsets contained in the patient's apheresis product possibly eliminates clonogenic tumor cells, but also serves as a target cell population for gene transduction. Genetic tagging of PBPC autografts has proven that: 1) NEOR gene expression is sustained for more than 18 months and 2) clonogenic tumor cells contaminating the autograft contribute to relapse. A second generation of gene transduction studies includes new treatment strategies such as the induction of chemoprotection (multidrug resistance gene-1), chemotherapy sensitization (p53), cancer vaccination and genetic chemosensitization. Most recently allogeneic PBPC transplantation has successfully been introduced with the intention of improving the graft-versus-leukemia effect without inducing a higher incidence or more severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) than what is expected after BM transplantation. Introducing the herpes virus thymidine kinase cDNA into activated donor T cells makes them susceptible to gangciclovir, thus allowing the in vivo inactivation of GVHD-inducing T cells. With the close interaction of molecular genetics and clinical oncology/hematology, genetic engineering of stem cell grafts will lead into a new stage of stem cell transplantation technology.","['Korbling, M']",['Korbling M'],"['University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['*Genetic Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530130717 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1995 Dec;13 Suppl 3:106-13. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530130717.,,,,,,55,,,,,,,,

This is primarily due to limitations of chromosomal banding techniques which have been the central methods for cytogenetic analysis. These techniques depend on the availability of fresh tumor tissue and the examination of metaphase cells which may not be representative for the major cell clone in vivo. In contrast, the new technique of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive view of chromosomal gains and losses by analyzing tumor DNA, which can be prepared from archival tissue samples. Results of CGH studies in three different types of lymphoproliferative disorders are outlined in this paper demonstrating that: (1) in chronic B cell leukemias, chromosomal aberrations are missed by banding analysis in a high proportion of cases, (2) CGH on paraffin-embedded tissue samples can be used for cytogenetic analysis within clinical multicenter trials and (3) DNA amplifications are more frequent in NHL than previously assumed.

In CLL, interphase cytogenetics will greatly contribute to the evaluation of the true incidence of specific chromosome aberrations and will provide the basis for more accurate correlations with the clinical outcome. The Philadelphia chromosome can be detected by FISH with high specificity and sensitivity in both CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In CML, it can be used to better assess the cytogenetic remission status following therapy with interferon-alpha.

Basis for the application of a PCR assay in these disease entities are the following specific gene rearrangements: the t(14;18) translocation in a high percentage of NHL, the clonal rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain locus resulting in a unique complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) for MM region and the inversion 16 characteristic for the M4Eo subclass of AML. Before the G-CSF-supported cytotoxic chemotherapy was given, 65% of the 52 patients with low- and intermediate-grade NHL enrolled into the study had PCR+ bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples. The majority of patients (29 of 52) were autografted with a PCR+ transplant. The proportion of harvests containing t(14;18)+ cells was two-fold less in patients mobilized in first remission than in those with a history of previous treatment failure. This was also reflected when examining the B cell contents of the harvests measured as CD19+ cells with a 3.3-fold smaller proportion of CD19+ cells in leukapheresis (LP) products of patients mobilized in first remission. Patients who received a PCR- transplant are in remission and remained PCR- in BM and PB samples post-transplantation. Conversion to PCR-negativity in BM and PB samples post-transplantation was observed in 11 of 19 patients who were also in remission. In contrast, 6 of 29 patients who were autografted with PCR+ products relapsed, while 4 of them presented with PCR- samples on several occasions post-transplantation. In patients with MM, the assessment of MRD in PBPC harvests was based on the CDR3 regions of the Ig heavy chain locus as a marker for clonality. The great majority of LP products (17 out of 19) contained tumor cells. To prove positive enrichment procedures for the elimination of tumor cells, CD34+ and CD19+ cell fractions obtained from LP samples in an experimental setting via preparative flow cytometry were analyzed for MRD resulting in PCR-negativity for all CD34+ fractions. The results of the four patients with AML M4Eo and inversion 16 are preliminary, with a tendency of persistence of PCR-positivity after finishing the high-dose consolidation therapy.

This neuronal death could be due to lack of retrogradely transported target derived neurotrophic factors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Another hypothesis suggests that glutamate and its receptors has been implicated as possible mechanism for motor neuron death. In order to investigate the effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor antagonists on axotomy-induced cell death in the spinal motor neurons of neonatal rats, we have studied neuroprotective effects of these receptor antagonists. Newborn rats were anesthetized with hypothermia. Sciatic nerve was transected near the obturator tendon in the left thigh. Animals were then treated daily with MK-801, APV, and CNQX for 14 days with intraperitoneal injections. Control animals received PBS in the same fashion. After the treatment, the number of spinal motor neurons in the L4-6 was counted. MK-801 and APV did not show any significant neuroprotective effect. By contrast, the number of surviving motor neurons was greater in animals that were treated with 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg of CNQX. This neuroprotective effect was not dose-related. We demonstrate that neuroprotective effect of CNQX on axotomized motor neurons, raises a possibility that such a agent may have therapeutic potential in motor neuronopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Iwasaki, Y', 'Ikeda, K', 'Shiojima, T', 'Kinoshita, M']","['Iwasaki Y', 'Ikeda K', 'Shiojima T', 'Kinoshita M']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Toho University Ohashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,IM,"['2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate/pharmacology', '6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Dizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Motor Neurons/*drug effects/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sciatic Nerve/*physiology', 'Spinal Cord/*drug effects/pathology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-510X(95)00217-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-510x(95)00217-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 1995 Dec;134(1-2):21-5. doi: 10.1016/0022-510x(95)00217-6.,,"['0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '6LR8C1B66Q (Dizocilpine Maleate)', '6OTE87SCCW (6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione)', '76726-92-6 (2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Human HIV infection has recently been shown to inhibit thymocyte maturation. Therefore, the kinetics of the proliferation of thymocytes induced by Con-canavalin A (ConA) and levels of cytokines produced by in vitro ConA-stimulated thymocytes were examined during the progression of murine AIDS. The proliferation of thymocytes induced by ConA was significantly enhanced by retrovirus infection at 4 weeks post-infection compared to control, but significantly inhibited during 8-12 weeks post-infection. Release of IL-2 by ConA-stimulated thymocytes was significantly increased by retrovirus infection during 2-5 weeks post-infection and 11-18 weeks post-infection compared to control, but significantly decreased during 7-9 weeks post-infection. Secretion of IL-4 by ConA-stimulated thymocytes was significantly enhanced by retrovirus infection from 5 to 18 weeks post-infection compared to control. The level of IL-6 produced by ConA-stimulated thymocytes was significantly inhibited by retrovirus infection at the beginning of retrovirus infection (2-9 weeks), but significantly elevated after 11 weeks post-infection compared to control. Release of IFNgamma by ConA-stimulated thymocytes, however, was significantly enhanced during the whole period of retrovirus infection compared to control, while it surged at 13 weeks post-infection. We conclude that retrovirus infection affects the thymus, producing altered T-cell differentiation via the dysregulation of thymocyte cytokine secretion.","['Wang, J', 'Huang, D S', 'Wood, S', 'Giger, P T', 'Watson, R R']","['Wang J', 'Huang DS', 'Wood S', 'Giger PT', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['Animals', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/immunology/virology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165247895000952 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(95)00095-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1995 Sep;47(3):187-92. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(95)00095-2.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",['AA 08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The intention of these studies was to determine a potential mechanism for thrombosis. This article reviews the current literature in this area. First, data on thrombotic complications in terms of incidence, location, diagnosis, and timing of events are summarized. The second section discusses the coagulopathy associated with the disease and treatment. To minimize the effects of confounding treatments, the data are divided into sections covering pretreatment, after ASP only, after combination chemotherapy without ASP, and after combination chemotherapy with ASP. In addition, the effects of glucocorticoid steroids on the hemostatic system are discussed. As thrombin regulation is critically important to hemostasis, the next section of the review discusses the regulation of thrombin in children with ALL, both in vitro and in vivo, and the link between impaired thrombin regulation and TE in this population. Finally current hypothesis on mechanisms for TE and proposed preventative strategies are examined.","['Mitchell, L G', 'Sutor, A H', 'Andrew, M']","['Mitchell LG', 'Sutor AH', 'Andrew M']","['Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Center, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,IM,"['Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombins/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bacterial Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Plasma', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1000660 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 1995;21(4):390-401. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1000660.,,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,80,,,,,,,,

Exposure of cells to various concentrations of BAPTA/AM for 6 h resulted in a biphasic induction of internucleosomal DNA cleavage, with maximal damage occurring at 10-microM concentrations. Higher BAPTA/AM concentrations were associated with the loss of internucleosomal cleavage products, but with the appearance of larger (i.e., 50-kilobase) fragments on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Cells exposed to 10 microM BAPTA/AM exhibited classic apoptotic morphology, whereas cells exposed to 50-microM concentrations displayed atypical features (e.g., cell swelling, chromatin clumping); in each case, substantial cytotoxicity was noted. The actions of BAPTA/AM did not depend upon the presence of extracellular Ca2+, nor were they affected by impermeant Ca2+ chelators. Measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ by Fura-2/AM or Indo-1 revealed late but not early increases in intracellular Ca2+ in BAPTA/AM-treated cells. Finally, BAPTA/AM-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the concentration-dependent downregulation of the immediate early response gene c-jun. These findings suggest a complex role for Ca2+ chelators such as BAPTA/AM in the regulation of human myeloid leukemic cell apoptosis, and indicate that this agent may selectively antagonize internucleosomal DNA fragmentation without interfering with other aspects of the apoptotic response and/or cell lethality.","['Grant, S', 'Freemerman, A J', 'Gregory, P C', 'Martin, H A', 'Turner, A J', 'Mikkelsen, R', 'Chelliah, J', 'Yanovich, S', 'Jarvis, W D']","['Grant S', 'Freemerman AJ', 'Gregory PC', 'Martin HA', 'Turner AJ', 'Mikkelsen R', 'Chelliah J', 'Yanovich S', 'Jarvis WD']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, jun/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1995;7(7-8):381-92.,,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['CA 63753-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the distinctive hexagonal bipyramidal crystals of CLC protein in body fluids and secretions has long been considered a hallmark of eosinophil-associated allergic inflammation. Although CLC protein possesses lysophospholipase activity, its role(s) in eosinophil or basophil function or associated inflammatory responses has remained speculative. RESULTS: The crystal structure of the CLC protein has been determined at 1.8 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. The overall structural fold of CLC protein is highly similar to that of galectins -1 and -2, members of an animal lectin family formerly classified as S-type or S-Lac (soluble lactose-binding) lectins. This is the first structure of an eosinophil protein to be determined and the highest resolution structure so far determined for any member of the galectin family. CONCLUSIONS: The CLC protein structure possesses a carbohydrate-recognition domain comprising most, but not all, of the carbohydrate-binding residues that are conserved among the galectins. The protein exhibits specific (albeit weak) carbohydrate-binding activity for simple saccharides including N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and lactose. Despite CLC protein having no significant sequence or structural similarities to other lysophospholipase catalytic triad has also been identified within the CLC structure, making it a unique dual-function polypeptide. These structural findings suggest a potential intracellular and/or extracellular role(s) for the galectin-associated activities of CLC protein in eosinophil and basophil function in allergic diseases and inflammation.","['Leonidas, D D', 'Elbert, B L', 'Zhou, Z', 'Leffler, H', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Acharya, K R']","['Leonidas DD', 'Elbert BL', 'Zhou Z', 'Leffler H', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Acharya KR']","['School of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Structure,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",101087697,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Eosinophils/enzymology', 'Galectin 1', 'Galectin 2', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Hemagglutinins/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lectins/chemistry/*classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lysophospholipase', '*Models, Molecular', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry', '*Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-2126(01)00275-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-2126(01)00275-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Structure. 1995 Dec 15;3(12):1379-93. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(01)00275-1.,,"['0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (Galectin 2)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (Lysophospholipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (lysolecithin acylhydrolase)']","['A125230/PHS HHS/United States', 'A134953/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of CD3 stimulation and PKC activators on cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+i) extrusion and 45Ca2+ efflux in human leukemic Jurkat T cells. Treatment of Fura-2 loaded cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or thymeleatoxin (THYM) resulted in a decrease in Ca2+i both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas inactive phorbol esters had no effect. PKC activators added at the peak of a Ca2+i transient induced by anti-CD3 mAb, ionomycin or thapsigargin (TG) stimulated the rate and extent of return of Ca2+i to basal levels by 17-53%. PKC stimulation of the Ca2+i decline was not enhanced by the presence of Na+, indicating that PKC activators increase Ca2+ pump activity rather than a Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism. As CD3 receptor activation enhanced the Ca2+i decline in TG-treated cells, antigen-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC) signaling includes enhanced Ca2+ extrusion at the plasma membrane. The effect of PKC activators on parameters of Ca2+i extrusion were further explored. PMA significantly increased the rate of Ca2+ extrusion in TG-treated cells from 0.28 +/- 0.02 to 0.35 +/- 0.03 s-1 (mean +/- SEM) and stimulated the initial rate of 45Ca2+ efflux by 69% compared to inactive phorbol ester treated cells. The effects of PKC activation on the Ca2+i decline were eliminated by PKC inhibitors, PKC down regulation (24 h PMA pretreatment), ATP-depletion and conditions that inhibited the Ca2+ pump. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid enhanced the PMA-stimulated response. We suggest that Jurkat T cells contain a PKC-sensitive Ca2+ extrusion mechanism likely to be the Ca2+ pump. In lymphocytes, receptor/PLC-linked PKC activation modulates Ca2+i not only by inhibiting Ca2+ influx but also by stimulating plasma membrane Ca2+i extrusion.","['Balasubramanyam, M', 'Gardner, J P']","['Balasubramanyam M', 'Gardner JP']","['Hypertension Research Center, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Lanthanum/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Sodium/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0143-4160(95)90015-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0143-4160(95)90015-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 1995 Dec;18(6):526-41. doi: 10.1016/0143-4160(95)90015-2.,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Terpenes)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)', '94482-56-1 (thymeleatoxin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",['HL-44196/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Six other potentially fatal diseases are also judged to be caused by smoking: respiratory heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, stroke, pneumonia, aortic aneurysm and ischaemic heart disease, the most common cause of death in economically developed countries. Non-fatal diseases, such as peripheral vascular disease, cataracts, hip fracture, and periodontal disease, which cause appreciable disability, cost and inconvenience are also caused by smoking. In pregnancy, smoking increases the risk of limb reduction defects, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and low birth weight. While there are some diseases for which smoking shows a protective effect, the 'benefits' of these are negligible in relation to the illness and premature mortality caused by smoking.

The principal mechanism of action of HHT is the inhibition of protein synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner by acting on the ribosomes of cancer cells. It blocks the progression of cells from G1 phase into S phase and from G2 phase into M phase. It is synergestic or additive in vitro with AraC, amsacrine, actinomycin D and dexamethasone. Clinical studies have indicated that HHT is effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but not acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and solid tumors. The dose limiting toxicities are hypotention and myelosuppression. Homoharringtonine has relatively mild extramedullary toxicities and no anthracycline-like cardiac toxicity, which make it a suitable candidate for the treatment of aged patients. Pharmacological studies indicate that HHT belongs to the category of multidrug resistance (MDR)-related drugs. The cells resistant to HHT are cross-resistant to anthracycline, vinca alkaloids, mitoxantrone, but not cis-platine and AraC.

The advancement of our knowledge of cytokines and growth factors has been critically important in fuelling the recent new understanding of embryo implantation. Specifically, our increased knowledge of the interleukin (IL)-1 system, as well as leukaemia-inhibiting factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor and colony-stimulating factor-1, and the availability of recombinant protein, specific antibodies and knockout mice, have led to a more detailed outline of implantation events. LIF and IL-1 are the two systems where recent advances have suggested their importance in implantation events. Recently, LIF has been shown in mice to be an endometrial requirement for implantation and embryo development. Although LIF is a pleiotropic molecule, with many interactions in multiple body tissues, in the uterus, concentrations are elevated on day 4 of pregnancy. Experiments with knockout mice have shown the requirement for endometrial LIF for successful implantation. The IL-1 system, consisting of two agonists (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta), two receptors (IL-1R types I and II) and the homologous IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), has also been studied. Knowledge that the embryo secretes IL-1 suggested the interaction between embryonic IL-1 and endometrial receptor, which has been shown to occur. IL-1R type I is plentiful on endometrial epithelial cells and appears to interact with embryonically secreted IL-1 beta to favour implantation. Such implantation events in vivo in mice are blocked by the introduction of large quantities of IL-1ra, consistent with the hypothesis that appropriate interactions between agonist and receptor at the level of the endometrial surface are a requisite for successful implantation. As more specific information on each cytokine or growth factor system comes to light, more complete information on the multiple molecular steps of implantation will become apparent. However, it is clear that no single cytokine or growth factor will be able to explain the complicated events of embryo implantation. Such an important necessary phenomenon has multiple redundancies. The interactions between cytokines and growth factors are becoming increasingly apparent and will need more experimental evidence before a full understanding of implantation is available.","['Polan, M L', 'Simon, C', 'Frances, A', 'Lee, B Y', 'Prichard, L E']","['Polan ML', 'Simon C', 'Frances A', 'Lee BY', 'Prichard LE']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5317, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,IM,"['Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Pregnancy']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/10.suppl_2.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1995 Dec;10 Suppl 2:22-9. doi: 10.1093/humrep/10.suppl_2.22.,,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,32,,,,,,,,

Naturin, a new Chinese medical herb produced by XingYa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., has enhanced immune response, inhibited tumor metastases and retroviral infection in animal models as well as in clinical studies. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of Natural Killer (NK) and Lymphokine-activated Killer (LAK) cell activity and lymphocyte proliferation was compromised by tumor metastases and retrovirus infection (Murine AIDS), even immunosuppression induced by surgical amputation can be restored by Naturin. It is also shown that Naturin can protect the mice from lethal total body irradiation. These studies indicated that Naturin possesses immunomodulatory effects in vivo for a broad range of stresses. The results of the clinical studies on Naturin have demonstrated: (a) significantly improved symptoms of patients, including MDS, acute and chronic leukemia, aplastic anemia, lung cancer, and association with the increased number and percentage of CD4 (Helper T-cell) which have been reduced in some patients, (b) Lymphocyte proliferation and NK cell activity which were suppressed in cancer patients can be significantly restored by Naturin treatment, (c) the addition of Naturin treatment to patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy augments immune response and reduces radiation and chemotherapy injury, and (d) no cytotoxic side effects were found in patients given Naturin treatment for up to eight months.","['Shen, R N', 'Lu, L', 'Jia, X Q', 'Wong, M L', 'Kaiser, H E']","['Shen RN', 'Lu L', 'Jia XQ', 'Wong ML', 'Kaiser HE']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 16202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*therapy', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1996 Mar-Apr;10(2):201-9.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported that mice infected with a lethal dose of FLV can be 100% cured by 150 cGy total body irradiation (TBI). This curative effect was associated with restoration of cellular immunity which was compromised by the virus. This restoration may result from activation of the IFN-gamma system and IL-2 production. Our research work further demonstrated that no spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) specific mRNAs, no 6.0kb SFFV fragments and SFFV envelope glycoproteins were detectable in FLV-infected mice treated with low dose TBI. Predicated on our report, del Regato has initiated clinical trials to treat AIDS patients with low dose TBI. The preliminary results are encouraging and the study is continuing. We have also studied the effects of low dose TBI on the expression of the P53 gene. The results show loss or inactivation of P53 tumor suppressor genes in FLV-infected mice, but P53 expression was restored in FLV-infected mice treated by low dose TBI. It is intriguing to speculate that in the curative effect of low dose TBI on mice infected with retrovirus, the P53 tumor suppressor gene may play an important role. It would be of interest to see if this type of treatment, which was well tolerated by mice, would be beneficial in other types of virally induced disease, including AIDS.","['Shen, R N', 'Lu, L', 'Kaiser, H E', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Shen RN', 'Lu L', 'Kaiser HE', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genes, p53', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Organ Size', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1996 Mar-Apr;10(2):191-9.,,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['R01 HL 46549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 49202/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since the development of this technique, the data have been interpreted by assuming free Brownian diffusion of cell surface receptors in two dimensions, an interpretation that requires that a subset of the diffusing species remains immobile. The origin of this so-called immobile fraction remains a mystery. In FPR, the motions of thousands of particles are inherently averaged, inevitably masking the details of individual motions. Recently, tracking of individual cell surface receptors has identified several distinct types of motion (Gross and Webb, 1988; Ghosh and Webb, 1988, 1990, 1994; Kusumi et al. 1993; Qian et al. 1991; Slattery, 1995), thereby calling into question the classical interpretation of FPR data as free Brownian motion of a limited mobile fraction. We have measured the motion of fluorescently labeled immunoglobulin E complexed to high affinity receptors (Fc epsilon RI) on rat basophilic leukemia cells using both single particle tracking and FPR. As in previous studies, our tracking results show that individual receptors may diffuse freely, or may exhibit restricted, time-dependent (anomalous) diffusion. Accordingly, we have analyzed FPR data by a new model to take this varied motion into account, and we show that the immobile fraction may be due to particles moving with the anomalous subdiffusion associated with restricted lateral mobility. Anomalous subdiffusion denotes random molecular motion in which the mean square displacements grow as a power law in time with a fractional positive exponent less than one. These findings call for a new model of cell membrane structure.","['Feder, T J', 'Brust-Mascher, I', 'Slattery, J P', 'Baird, B', 'Webb, W W']","['Feder TJ', 'Brust-Mascher I', 'Slattery JP', 'Baird B', 'Webb WW']","['Department of Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,IM,"['Animals', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Membrane Lipids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/chemistry/metabolism']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(96)79846-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79846-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1996 Jun;70(6):2767-73. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79846-6.,PMC1225256,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']","['AI10306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P41RR04224/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Biophys J. 2011 Feb 2;100(3):791-2; author reply 793-4.

Because the oxidizing agent menadione is known to damage mitochondria and the cytoplasmic membrane in other cell systems, before conducting measurements of oxygen concentration in K562 and A431 cells, it was necessary to establish injury in these systems as well. Consequently, morphological and flow cytometric analyses were conducted after menadione treatment. The data presented here show that the two cell lines are heavily damaged by menadione. Once this menadione-induced injury was demonstrated, measurements of oxygen concentration were carried out in both K562 and A431 cells. Treatment with this quinone induces a sharp increase in intracytoplasmic molecular oxygen in both cell lines (from about 1% to about 10 and 15% in K562 and A431 cells, respectively). In addition, to gain a more complete understanding of the effects of menadione on cells, the extracellular molecular oxygen concentration and the oxygen consumption rate were also measured in control and menadione-treated K562 cells. These measurements demonstrate that menadione treatment results in an increase in the extracellular oxygen concentration (from about 5% in controls to 15% in treated cells) as well as a decrease in the oxygen consumption rate (from about 10 ng O/min/10(6) cells in controls to 3 ng O/min/10(6) cells after menadione exposure). The importance of the new EPR probe fusinite in monitoring directly cellular functions in which oxygen is involved and the effects of menadione on cellular oxygen balance are discussed.","['Santini, M T', 'Morelli, G', 'Fattorossi, A', 'Malorni, W', 'Rainaldi, G', 'Indovina, P L']","['Santini MT', 'Morelli G', 'Fattorossi A', 'Malorni W', 'Rainaldi G', 'Indovina PL']","['Laboratorio di Ultrastrutture, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Calibration', 'Carbon', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Probes', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin K/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0891584995022066 [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(95)02206-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1996;20(7):915-24. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(95)02206-6.,,"['0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (fusinite)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased rates of flap failure have been associated with reconstruction performed between 3 days and 6 weeks after injury, as well as in patients with thrombocytosis. We have found that serum platelet levels rise significantly after lower extremity injury. It is our theory that a circulating mediator or cytokine is released in response to injury, inducing the thrombocytosis. Twenty-one patients with Gustilo grade IIIb and IIIc injuries were studied prospectively. Serum was collected throughout the postinjury period. Platelet count, leukocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit were determined. Samples were also subjected to a platelet aggregation study as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for interleukin-3, interleukin-6, interleukin-11, and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Megakaryocyte growth and development factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a myleoproliferative leukemia virus-transfected cell line assay for thrombopoietin were performed. Bone marrow was studied with flow cytometric analysis. Mean initial platelet count was 196,000 per cubic millimeter. There was an initial 26% decline to 140,000 per cubic millimeter, followed by an increase to 361% of baseline on day 16. No significant variations in serum leukocyte count or hemoglobin concentration were seen. Spontaneous and induced platelet aggregation responses were normal. Interleukin-6 was detected at elevated levels. However, interleukin-3, interleukin-11, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and thrombopoietin were not measurable. Marked megakaryocytosis was seen on bone marrow analysis. Interleukin-6 may, therefore, play a role in the mechanism of thrombocytosis. We suggest that because patients with complex bony injuries of the leg experience platelet elevations that peak approximately 2 weeks after injury, microvascular free flap reconstructions should be considered high risk during this time period.","['Choe, E I', 'Kasabian, A K', 'Kolker, A R', 'Karp, N S', 'Zhang, L', 'Bass, L S', 'Nardi, M', 'Josephson, G', 'Karpatkin, M']","['Choe EI', 'Kasabian AK', 'Kolker AR', 'Karp NS', 'Zhang L', 'Bass LS', 'Nardi M', 'Josephson G', 'Karpatkin M']","['Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery, New York University Medical Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Plast Surg,Annals of plastic surgery,7805336,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leg Injuries/*complications/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Count', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', '*Surgical Flaps', 'Thrombocytosis/*etiology/*surgery', 'Thrombopoietin/blood']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000637-199605000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Plast Surg. 1996 May;36(5):489-94. doi: 10.1097/00000637-199605000-00010.,,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 human leukemia cells are a widely employed model system for the analysis of signal transduction processes mediated via regulatory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). HL-60 promyelocytes are pluripotent and can be differentiated into neutrophilic or monocytic cells. 2. HL-60 cells express formyl peptide-, complement C5a-, leukotriene B4 (LTB4)- and platelet-activating factor receptors, receptors for purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, histamine H1- and H2-receptors, beta 2-adrenoceptors and prostaglandin receptors. 3. The major G-proteins in HL-60 cells are pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi-proteins (Gi2 > Gi3). Gs-proteins and G-proteins of the Gq-family (e.g., G16) are expressed, too. 4. G-protein-regulated effector systems in HL-60 cells are adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C-beta 2 (PLC-beta 2) and, possibly, phospholipase D (PLD), nonselective cation (NSC) channels and NADPH oxidase. 5. The expression of signal transduction pathways in HL-60 cells strongly depends on the differentiation state of cells. 6. Formyl peptides, via Gi-proteins, mediate activation of PLC, PLD, NSC channels, NADPH oxidase and azurophilic granule release and are referred to as full secretagogues. In dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP)-differentiated HL-60 cells, C5a and LTB4 are partial and incomplete secretagogues, respectively. There are substantial differences in the Gi-protein activations induced by formyl peptides, C5a and LTB4. 7. In HL-60 promyelocytes, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides mediate activation of PLC and NSC channels largely via PTX-insensitive G-proteins and induce functional differentiation. In Bt2cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells, they additionally activate PLD, NADPH oxidase and granule release via PTX-sensitive and -insensitive pathways. ATP and UTP are partial secretagogues. Multiple types of receptors (i.e., P2Y- and P2U-receptors and pyrimidinocyeptors) may mediate the effects of nucleotides in HL-60 cells. 8. Bt2cAMP- and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-differentiated HL-60 cells express H1-receptors coupled to Gi-proteins and PTX-insensitive G-proteins. In the former cells, histamine mediates activation of PLC and NSC channels, and in the latter, activation of NSC channels. Histamine is an incomplete secretagogue in these cells. 9. HL-60 promyelocytes express H2-receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase, PLC, and NSC channels. There are substantial differences in the agonist/antagonist profiles of H2-receptor-mediated cAMP formation and rises in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, indicative of the involvement of different H2-receptor subtypes. H2-receptors mediate functional differentiation of HL-60 cells. 10. Certain cationic-amphiphilic histamine receptor ligands (i.e., 2-substituted histamines, lipophilic guanidines, and a histamine trifluoromethyl-toluidide derivative) show stimulatory effects in HL-60 cells that are attributable to receptor-independent activation of Gi-proteins.","['Klinker, J F', 'Wenzel-Seifert, K', 'Seifert, R']","['Klinker JF', 'Wenzel-Seifert K', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Gen Pharmacol,General pharmacology,7602417,IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Calcium Channels/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/*chemistry/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/chemistry', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Complement', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Histamine', '*Receptors, Immunologic', '*Receptors, Peptide', 'Receptors, Purinergic', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306362395001077 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-3623(95)00107-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Gen Pharmacol. 1996 Jan;27(1):33-54. doi: 10.1016/0306-3623(95)00107-7.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,247,,,,,,,,

The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of combining IFN-alpha with each of the three chemotherapeutic drugs carboplatin, daunorubicin, and cytarabine were evaluated in three human myeloid leukemia cell lines representing different stages of differentiation: MHH225 (CD34-positive multilineage), HL-60 (promyelocytic), and U937 (monoblastic) in both liquid suspension and agar clonogenic cultures. The ED90 (the concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs required for 90% inhibition of colony formation or cell death) in human myeloid leukemia cells were in the following order: daunorubicin > carboplatin > cytarabine, with HL-60 the most sensitive and MHH225 the least sensitive. Whereas IFN-alpha failed to decrease significantly the ED90 of cytarabine in the three human myeloid leukemia cell lines, it significantly decreased the ED90 of carboplatin and to a lesser extent daunorubicin in both liquid suspension and agar clonogenic cultures. The present results are in line with the previous results of a negative interaction between IFN-alpha and cytarabine both in vitro in K562 human leukemia and in vivo in L1210 murine leukemia, and a synergistic cytostatic interaction between IFN-alpha and carboplatin in K562 cells. The significant synergism between IFN-alpha and carboplatin was observed in all four human myeloid leukemia cell lines with various stages of differentiation and confirmed in both serum-free and serum-supplemented cultures applying different in vitro assays: liquid suspension, agar clonogenic, and capillary agar microclonogenic cultures. Thus, given the in vitro profound synergism between IFN-alpha and carboplatin in all four human myeloid leukemia cells tested, together with the in vivo significant antileukemic activity of both IFN-alpha and carboplatin in several reported clinical studies for myeloid leukemia patients, the clinical use of the combination of IFN-alpha and carboplatin in the treatment of CML patients could prolong the complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses and consequently improve the survival rate. On the other hand, given the negative interaction between IFN-alpha and cytarabine observed in myeloid leukemia cells, together with the inferior cytogenetic responses observed in CML patients treated with the combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine, caution should be exercised against the continuous clinical use of the combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine in treating CML patients. In conclusion, the present results suggest the use of carboplatin and to a lesser extent daunorubicin instead of cytarabine in combination with IFN-alpha for the treatment of CML patients.","['Hassan, H T', 'Grell, S', 'Borrmann-Danso, U', 'Freund, M']","['Hassan HT', 'Grell S', 'Borrmann-Danso U', 'Freund M']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University of Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1996.16.139 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996 Feb;16(2):139-46. doi: 10.1089/jir.1996.16.139.,,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

M. Messina and D. A. Lawrence, 1992, Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 14, 1221-1234). In addition, when cells are undergoing active growth, they usually have an increased thiol content. In an attempt to determine whether a mouse and a human cell line with similar characteristics can be induced to change their phenotype simply by being cultured at a lower oxygen partial pressure (pO2), the human KG-1 and mouse M1 myeloid cell lines were cultured at 5 and 20% oxygen. It is important to note that 5% O2 is close to the physiological pO2, whereas the percentage of O2 usually employed for most in vitro methods is atmospheric pO2. After long-term culturing at 5% (L cell lines) versus 20% O2 (H cell lines), the thiol content of the original (H) cell lines significantly changed. The amount of total and surface thiols was lower in both L cell lines, but only significantly different on the M1 lines, whereas the glutathione content was significantly lower in the L cell lines of KG-1 and M1. The mouse lines showed the greatest sensitivity to pO2 changes; however, the mouse cell lines were not more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than the human cell lines even though they possess significantly less total thiols and glutathione. Interestingly, cell lines maintained at lower pO2 (physiological pO2) were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than their parental counterparts that were maintained at atmospheric oxygen levels.","['Lawrence, D A', 'Colinas, R J', 'Walsh, A C']","['Lawrence DA', 'Colinas RJ', 'Walsh AC']","['Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany 12201-0509, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Fundam Appl Toxicol,Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology,8200838,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxygen/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Partial Pressure', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0272059096900330 [pii]', '10.1006/faat.1996.0033 [doi]']",ppublish,Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1996 Feb;29(2):287-93. doi: 10.1006/faat.1996.0033.,,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",['ES03778/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mice were intratracheally administered a benchmark protein allergen, subtilisin Carlsberg (Alcalase) in detergent matrix once a week for 4 to 6 weeks and specific IgE and IgG1 levels were determined. In all experiments, specific IgE levels were determined by using a rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL) release assay, while specific IgG1 was measured by an ELISA. A good correlation was observed between IgE titers determined by the RBL assay and rat passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay. Intratracheal administration of protease with detergent matrix was found to result in significant IgE and IgG1 responses that were dose related. Detergent matrix was found to enhance the Alcalase-specific IgE and IgG1 response when administered by the intratracheal route. The IgG1 response was much more robust, easier to measure, and found to follow the IgE response. These results suggest that a mouse intratracheal model is a feasible approach to examining the immunogenic potency of enzymes using specific IgE or IgG1 as the end points.

To study functional aspects of the murine homologue, we established inducible overexpression of murine ADF in E. coli and a purification method which led to an apparently homogeneous 14 kDa protein. This recombinant ADF was tested in proliferation assays with murine Th2 cells (D10.G4.1) and CTLL-2 cells. In synergy with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-9 ADF displayed co-cytokine activity. These proliferative effects were neutralized by an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-ADF antiserum. The effects of ADF were critically dependent on the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Bacterial thioredoxin had similar effects on the proliferation of murine T cells. Thus, the thiol-related reducing capacity of these proteins is essential for their growth promoting activity. As investigated at the levels of mRNA and protein in several murine cell clones and lines as well as in mouse tissues ADF is expressed ubiquitously. Finally it could be demonstrated by competitive PCR that in contrast to cytokine mRNAs (e.g. IL-4 and IL-13) the expression of ADF mRNA in murine Th2 clones and spleen cells is not influenced by stimulation of these cells through the T cell receptor complex. Murine ADF therefore represents a protein constitutively expressed in a wide variety of cells with the capacity to enhance the proliferative effect of several cytokines on murine T cells.","['Blum, H', 'Rollinghoff, M', 'Gessner, A']","['Blum H', 'Rollinghoff M', 'Gessner A']","['Institut fur Klinische Mikrobiologie und Immunologie Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Synergism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/immunology', 'Thioredoxins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(96)90002-2 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1996.0002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1996 Jan;8(1):6-13. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1996.0002.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of human papilloma viruses (HPV 16 and 18), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV), and retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus [HTLV]) in the development of common carcinomas and lymphomas represents a major cancer threat, particularly among individuals residing in developing countries, which account for 80% of the world's population. Even though these viruses are not the sole etiological agents of these cancers (as would be the case for infectious diseases), different approaches can be implemented to significantly decrease the incidence of virus-associated malignancies. The first approach is vaccination, which is available for HBV and possibly soon for EBV. The long delay between primary viral infection and development of associated tumors as well as the cost involved with administering vaccinations detracts from the feasibility of such an approach within developing countries. The second approach is to increase efforts to detect pre-cancerous lesions or early tumors using immunovirological means. This would allow early diagnosis and better treatment. The third strategy is linked to the existence of disease susceptibility genes, and suggests that counseling be provided for individuals carrying these genes to encourage them to modify their lifestyles and other conditions associated with increased cancer risks (predictive oncology). Specific recommendations include: a) increase international studies that explore the causes of the large variations in prevalence of common cancers throughout the world; b) conduct interdisciplinary studies involving laboratory investigation and social sciences, which may suggest hypotheses that may then be tested experimentally; and c) promote more preventive and health enhancement strategies in addition to curative and replacement therapies.","['de The, G']",['de The G'],"['Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland and Institut Pasteur, Unit of Epidemiology of Oncogenic Viruses, Paris, France. dethe@pasteur.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/virology', 'Carcinoma/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/virology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*prevention & control/*virology', 'Viral Vaccines']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.95103s8269 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1995 Nov;103 Suppl 8:269-73. doi: 10.1289/ehp.95103s8269.,PMC1518983,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],,,,22,,,,,,,,

Continued follow-up of these populations is important to determine the long-term effects of exposure in childhood, to characterize temporal patterns of excess risk for different types of cancer, and to understand better the interactions between radiation and other host and environmental factors. Most population exposure to radiation occurs at very low dose rates. For low linear energy transfer (LET) radiations, it often has been assumed that cancer risks per unit dose are lower following protracted exposure than following acute exposure. Studies of nuclear workers chronically exposed over a working lifetime provide data that can be used to test this hypothesis, and preliminary indications are that the risks per unit dose for most cancers other than leukemia are similar to those for acute exposure. However, these results are subject to considerable uncertainty, and further information on this question is needed. Residential radon is the major source of population exposure to high-LET radiation. Current estimates of the risk of lung cancer due to residential exposure to radon and radon daughters are based on the experience of miners exposed to much higher concentrations. Data indicate that lung cancer risk among miners is inversely associated with exposure rate, and also is influenced by the presence of other lung carcinogens such as arsenic in the mine environment. Further study of populations of radon-exposed miners would be informative, particularly those exposed at below-average levels. More direct evidence on the effects of residential exposure to radon also is desirable but might be difficult to come by, as risks associated with radon levels found in most homes might be too low to be quantified accurately in epidemiological studies.","['Darby, S C', 'Inskip, P D']","['Darby SC', 'Inskip PD']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Power Plants', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radioactive Fallout/adverse effects', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radon/adverse effects', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Ukraine']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.95103s8245 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1995 Nov;103 Suppl 8:245-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.95103s8245.,PMC1518972,"['0 (Radioactive Fallout)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Farmers, despite a generally favorable mortality, appear to experience elevated rates for several cancers, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and cancers of the skin, lip, stomach, brain, and prostate. The rates for several of these tumors (i.e., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, skin, brain, and prostate) appear to be increasing in the general population. No set of established etiologic factors explains all the cancer excesses observed among farmers, although several are associated with naturally occurring or medically induced immunodeficiencies. This suggests that there may be factors in the agricultural environment that introduce immune system deficiencies. Farmers are exposed to a variety of substances that could operate through this mechanism, including pesticides, engine exhausts, solvents, dusts, and zoonotic microbes. Studies to further characterize the cancer risk among farmers, their dependents, and farm laborers, and to identify the exposures that may be involved would not only be useful in providing a safe work environment in agriculture but may furnish considerable insight into the causes for a number of tumors that are rising in incidence in the general population.","['Blair, A', 'Zahm, S H']","['Blair A', 'Zahm SH']","['Occupational Studies Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

In this study, we tested the pathogenicity of four different PVC viruses in mice. Although histopathological studies revealed spongiform degeneration in the spinal cords of NFS mice infected with each PVC virus, only PVC441 frequently induced tremor and paralysis. After a long latency, all of these viruses induced leukemia associated with severe anemia. Further studies with PVC441 revealed dose- and age-dependence for tremor induction. In contrast to NFS mice, BALB/c, DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice infected with PVC441 virus showed no neurological symptoms, although the virus could be isolated from the tissues of central nervous system. Despite the absence of neurological symptoms, a high degree of neuronal degeneration in the lumbar spinal cord was found in PVC441-infected BALB/c mice. A low degree of neuronal degeneration was found in PVC441-infected DBA/2 or C57BL/6 mice. Genetic crosses of these resistant mice with susceptible NFS mice indicated that resistance to tremor induction by PVC441 was dominant in all mouse strains and suggested that various host genes may control the susceptibility of mice to tremor induction by PVC441 virus.","['Kai, K', 'Mitsuno, K', 'Goto, N', 'Ami, Y', 'Ando, S', 'Kanoe, M']","['Kai K', 'Mitsuno K', 'Goto N', 'Ami Y', 'Ando S', 'Kanoe M']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/pathology/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nervous System Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Paralysis/pathology/*virology', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Spinal Cord/pathology/virology', 'Spleen/pathology/virology', 'Tremor']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.58.285 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 1996 Apr;58(4):285-90. doi: 10.1292/jvms.58.285.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which these processes occur is unclear. We find that these processes can be regulated by CGP 52411, 4,5-dianilinophthalimide, an inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinases of the EGF receptor subfamily. Retinoic acid causes the largely phosphorylated RB protein expressed in proliferating HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells to shift to the unphosphorylated form, as well as causing the cells to G0 arrest and differentiate. Addition of CGP 52411 accelerated the redistribution of the RB protein expressed in HL-60 cells to the unphosphorylated form, enhancing the effects of the retinoic acid. By itself CGP 52411 had no apparent effect on the RB protein expressed in HL-60 cells. CGP 52411 also accelerated the retinoic acid-induced accumulation of cells in G1/0 and the phenotypic conversion of cells to the mature myeloid phenotype, suggesting that its target is common to the regulation of both RB phosphorylation and cell proliferation and differentiation. CGP 52411 had a similar effect on the RB phosphorylation shift induced by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, a ligand for a receptor in the same steroid thyroid hormone superfamily as retinoic acid. Increasing the concentration of CGP 52411 enhanced the acceleration of RB hypophosphorylation in the case of both retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3. The data are consistent with the negative regulation of retinoic acid induced RB protein dephosphorylation coupled to cell cycle arrest and differentiation by a receptor tyrosine kinase sensitive to CGP 52411.","['Yen, A', 'Soong, S']","['Yen A', 'Soong S']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-6401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phthalimides/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1996 Apr;69(4):327-34.,,"['0 (Phthalimides)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)', 'Z13D008FZ2 (4,5-dianilinophthalimide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have performed a phase I study using a fixed dose of ifosfamide with escalating doses of paclitaxel, with G-CSF support, in an effort to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel in this combination, and to describe the dose-limiting toxicities of the combination at the recommended phase II dose of paclitaxel. We also studied the feasibility of delivering the paclitaxel as a one-hour infusion at the recommended phase II dose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients were treated, 25 with stage IV disease, and 6 with stage IIIB disease. Ifosfamide was administered at a dose of 1.6 g/m2 i.v. bolus daily x 3 days, with mesna uroprotection. Paclitaxel was administered as a 24-hour infusion at dose levels of 135, 170, 200, 250, and 300 mg/m2; six patients were treated with a one-hour infusion, at a dose of 250 mg/m2. G-CSF, 5 micrograms/kg, was administered subcutaneously on days 4 through 10, or until the absolute neutrophil count exceeded 4000/microliters. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. RESULTS: The dose-limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia, which increased with increasing dose levels of paclitaxel. The MTD was 300 mg/m2 of paclitaxel, and the recommended phase II dose 250 mg/m2 administered as a 24-hour infusion. Other toxicities were generally mild, with only 5 patients demonstrating grade 3 neurotoxicity and 5 with grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Partial responses were seen in seven patients (23%), all in the 18 patients who received dose levels of 250 mg/m2 or higher. CONCLUSIONS: Ifosfamide plus paclitaxel is an active treatment regimen in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, and compares favorably with the results of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A phase II study is in progress by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, in an effort to better characterize the tolerance of the regimen, as well as its effect on tumor response and survival.","['Hoffman, P C', 'Masters, G A', 'Drinkard, L C', 'Krauss, S A', 'Samuels, B L', 'Golomb, H M', 'Vokes, E E']","['Hoffman PC', 'Masters GA', 'Drinkard LC', 'Krauss SA', 'Samuels BL', 'Golomb HM', 'Vokes EE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010578 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)31805-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Mar;7(3):314-6. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010578.,,"['P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The CCND1 gene is involved in the t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal rearrangement, a characteristic abnormality in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We and others reported that, in contrast to other B-cell lymphomas, almost all MCL have over-expression of the CCND1 gene with a good correlation between RNA and protein analysis. Recent studies showed that overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein can be easily detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate whether the CCND1 gene is involved in HCL, we performed IHC on a series of 22 cases using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded splenectomy specimens. For IHC the sections were boiled in citrate buffer. The presence of rearrangements within the BCL-1 locus and the CCND1 gene was analyzed in 13 of 22 cases by Southern blot analysis using all available break-point probes. Expression of CCND1 was analyzed at the mRNA level (Northern blot) and protein level (IHC). RESULTS: Overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein using IHC was observed in all cases, with strong expression in 5 cases. Pre-existing B- and T-cell areas of the spleen did not express significant levels of the cyclin D1 protein. Seven of 9 cases analyzed by both IHC and Northern blotting showed overexpression of the CCND1 gene with both methods. No genomic abnormalities were observed in any of the 13 cases studied by Southern blot analysis. Additionally, no 11q13 abnormalities were detected by banding analysis of 19 of 22 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated levels of CCND1 mRNA and protein in conjunction with the absence of overt rearrangements within the BCL-1 locus distinguish HCL from MCL and other B-cell malignancies. This suggests that activation of the CCND1 gene in HCL is due to mechanisms other than chromosomal rearrangement.","['de Boer, C J', 'Kluin-Nelemans, J C', 'Dreef, E', 'Kester, M G', 'Kluin, P M', 'Schuuring, E', 'van Krieken, J H']","['de Boer CJ', 'Kluin-Nelemans JC', 'Dreef E', 'Kester MG', 'Kluin PM', 'Schuuring E', 'van Krieken JH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclins/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010568 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)31795-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Mar;7(3):251-6. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010568.,,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

HL60 cells showed a modest 1.4-fold (p < 0.01) increase in sensitivity to 2 Gy radiation given 24 h after a 1 h treatment with paclitaxel.

We hypothesised that this cytokine may play a pro-inflammatory role in the skin and tested this hypothesis by injecting recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (1-100 ng) into the ear pinnae of C3H/HeJ mice. To other groups of animals, we injected boiled leukemia inhibitory factor or phosphate-buffered saline (negative control) or 0.4 ng human interleukin-1 alpha as a positive control. Following injection of 100 ng leukemia inhibitory factor, ear thickness, measured by micrometer, increased 66% over controls at 12 h and 100% at 24 h (overall p = 0.041 by analysis of variance).

Leukemia inhibitory factor (100 ng only) stimulated a 3.5-fold increase in leukocytes after 6 h. After 12 h, a 14-fold increase was seen in ears injected with 10 ng leukemia inhibitory factor and a 12-fold increase with 100 ng leukemia inhibitory factor, which remained elevated (17-fold) at 24 h (overall p = 0.0001).

Seven different galectins have been sequenced and characterized in mammals, and there is compelling evidence for the existence of other members of this lectin family. Three among six galectins are homodimers with (i) an identical subunit of a relative molecular mass of about 14500, and (ii) amino acid sequence homologies giving rise to possible immunochemical cross-reactivities. They are indistinguishable from each other by conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), even when followed by immunoblotting. However, their different isoelectric points allow their identification using isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A strategy was developed to identify these galectins in crude extracts from cells and tissues, based on the two-dimensional electrophoresis with immobilized pH gradient (IPG-Dalt) analysis of the specific spots of purified galectins and of the spots of crude extracts, after silver staining. In addition, 2-D immunoblotting using anti-galectin 1 (Gal-1) and anti carbohydrate-binding protein 15 (CPB15) antibodies were performed on brain and leukemia cells (HL60) allowing an identification of related polypeptides.

We processed 25 autologous BM grafts with the Fresenius AS104 cell separator for cryopreservation and we determined recoveries for mononuclear cells (MNC) and colonyforming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) in the BM concentrates. To identify cell loss in BM fractions not cryopreserved, we investigated the MNC and CFU-GM content of BM fat and BM blood. MNC and CFU-GM recovery yielded a mean ( +/- SEM) of 42 +/- 12 and 54 +/- 20% in the BM concentrate. BM fat showed a mean loss of 7 +/- 5% for MNC and 4 +/- 3% for CFU-GM, BM blood 30 +/- 12% for MNC and 13 +/- 13% for CFU-GM, respectively. CFU-GM recovery was significantly higher in the BM concentrate of patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) compared with patients suffering from germ cell cancer (GCC): 66 +/- 21 vs. 43 +/- 12% (p < 0.02). Seventeen patients (7 GCC, 10 HM) underwent high-dose chemotherapy or radio-/chemotherapy and were autografted with 0.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(8) MNC/kg and 3.7 +/- 2.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg. All patients achieved engraftment with neutrophils > 0.5 x 10(9)/l at a mean of 14 +/- 6 days. We conclude that: (1) ex vivo processing of autologous BM with a mean of recovery of 42% for MNC and 54% for CFU-GM in the BM concentrate can result in a cell population capable of sustained hematopoietic reconstitution, (2) CFU-GM recovery is significantly higher in patients with HM than in patients with GCC and (3) 37% MNC and 17% CFU-GM represent in fact cell losses recovered from BM fractions not cryopreserved (BM fat, BM blood). Furthermore, it is likely that MNC and CFU-GM not recovered from BM concentrate, BM fat and BM blood are cell losses related to the cell separator.","['Schwella, N', 'Heuft, H G', 'Rick, O', 'Blasczyk, R', 'Wittmann, G', 'Huhn, D']","['Schwella N', 'Heuft HG', 'Rick O', 'Blasczyk R', 'Wittmann G', 'Huhn D']","['Virchow-Klinikum, Humboldt-Universitat Berlin, Deutschland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1423-0410.1996.tb01310.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 1996;70(3):132-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1423-0410.1996.tb01310.x.,,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumors that most frequently metastasize to the upper gastrointestinal tract are reported to be melanoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. We describe here our experience in relation to the clinical manifestations and endoscopic findings of metastatic tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Excluding leukemia, lymphoma, and direct tumor invasion, eight cases of metastatic tumor in the upper gastrointestinal tract from five identified primaries were observed over a period of eight years. The histological nature of the lesions was verified by endoscopic biopsy. RESULTS: The primary tumors in the eight cases were lung cancer (two cases), renal transitional-cell carcinoma (two cases), colonic cancer (two cases), melanoma (one case) and testicular embryonal cell carcinoma (one case). Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia were the most common features of the clinical presentation, and the stomach and duodenum were the organs most often involved. Endoscopically, submucosal tumors and polypoid masses, with either erosion or ulceration, were the usual morphological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Panendoscopy with histological examination is a way of identifying metastatic tumors to the upper gastrointestinal tract when patients have a known primary cancer and symptoms relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract.

No major difference between total and selective bowel decontamination.,200-6,"To evaluate the effect of total bowel decontamination (TD) and selective bowel decontamination (SD) in a non-protective environment clinical and laboratory data of children treated for acute leukaemia between 1983 and 1991 were analysed retrospectively. From 1983 until 1989 34 patients [18 acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) patients, 16 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients] received TD and 31 patients (8 ANLL patients, 23 ALL patients) received SD from 1987 until 1991. TD consisted of colistin sulphate, neomycin, cephaloridine and amphotericin B orally as well as Orabase and sterilized food, while the patients were nursed in a single room. SD consisted of oral colistin sulphate, neomycin and amphotericin B. Those patients with ANLL were nursed in a single room; patients with ALL were nursed in a single room during remission induction therapy only. All patients except those with ANLL receiving TD received Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole. Because the two groups were heterogeneous for diagnosis and chemotherapy the occurrence of fever (central body temperature at least 38.5 degrees C) and major infections (septicaemia of infections of the deep tissues or organs) were registered during periods of neutropenia (neutrophilic granulocytes < or = 500/mm3 for at least 8 days). Patients on TD had 55 periods of neutropenia, patients on SD 80. Patients on TD had 89.1 periods of fever/100 periods of neutropenia whereas patients on SD had 56.3. Also patients on TD had 27.3 major infections/100 periods of neutropenia whereas patients on SD had 11.3. Major infections predominantly consisted of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria. We conclude that, in this study, TD in a non-protective environment does not offer better protection against major infections that SD in patients with ALL or ANLL.","['Muis, N', 'Kamps, W A', 'Dankert, J']","['Muis N', 'Kamps WA', 'Dankert J']","['Paediatric Oncology Centre, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/microbiology', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cephaloridine/therapeutic use', 'Cephalosporins/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colistin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Food Handling', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intestines/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/nursing/*therapy', 'Neomycin/therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/nursing/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sterilization', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/therapeutic use']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01682341 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 1996 May;4(3):200-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01682341.,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', '81209-86-1 (Orabase)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'K679OBS311 (Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium)', 'LVZ1VC61HB (Cephaloridine)', 'Z67X93HJG1 (Colistin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiviral effectiveness of BMS-180194 against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice was investigated and was compared to that of ganciclovir (GCV). LP-BM5 murine retrovirus complex-induced immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice were challenged with MCMV then treated intraperitoneally or per os with various doses of BMS-180194 ranging from 30 to 3 mg/kg/day. When administered intraperitoneally, BMS-180194 was effective against MCMV-mediated mortality in a dose-dependent manner demonstrating a 50% protective dose (PD50) of 3.12 mg/kg/day which was comparable to that of GCV. There was a marked reduction in organ MCMV titers in BMS-180194-treated animals (10-10,000- fold lower than the placebo controls). Similar findings were observed when the compound was administered orally. Interestingly, oral BMS-180194 demonstrated a similar antiviral efficacy as that obtained by the parental route of administration suggesting a high oral bioavailability of the compound. Oral ganciclovir treatment, however, required more than a 4-fold higher amount of GCV to confer the same degree of protection obtained by a parenteral route of administration. Oral BMS-180194 was also effective in reducing the organ MCMV titer in genetically severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The parenteral or oral antiviral efficacy of BMS-180194 was comparable to that of parenteral ganciclovir against MCMV infection in the present study. Doses of BMS-180194 employed in the present study showed no toxicity to mice. These results suggest that BMS-180194 may be of value as an oral antiviral agent for treatment of opportunistic CMV infections in immunocompromised individuals.","['Yang, H', 'Drain, R L', 'Franco, C A', 'Clark, J M']","['Yang H', 'Drain RL', 'Franco CA', 'Clark JM']","['Department of Microbiology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Wallingford, CT 06492-7600, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*drug therapy', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Muromegalovirus/*drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-3542(95)00901-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(95)00901-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1996 Mar;29(2-3):233-41. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(95)00901-9.,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '8U5PYQ1R2E (lobucavir)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported the antiviral activity in vitro of HIV-1 protease inhibitors against the C-type retrovirus Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RMuLV) and the lentivirus simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The same compounds which blocked the infectivity of HIV-1 also inhibited the infectivity of RMuLV and SIV in vitro. This report extends these findings by testing the antiviral activity of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in vivo in the RMuLV model. RMuLV-infected mice were treated twice a day (bid) with either an active (SKF 108922) or inactive (SKF 109273) compound for fourteen days by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Compared with excipient control, SKF 108922, formulated with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPB), reduced virus-induced splenomegaly, viremia, and serum reverse transcriptase (RT) levels, while SKF 109273 was inactive. The HPB vehicle by itself enhanced replication of RMuLV. The effects of changing the formulation and the route of administration were examined. SKF 108922, formulated in HPB, had similar antiviral activity when administered by the i.p. or subcutaneous (SC) routes. However, SKF 108922 administered as a colloidal suspension in cholesterol sulfate (CS) had no detectable antiviral effect. Measurements of the circulating levels of the protease inhibitor in plasma explained this result. Plasma concentrations of SKF 108922 exceeded 1000 nM within 10 min after SC administration of the compound solubilized in HPB, but SKF 108922 was not detected in plasma after SC administration of the same dose formulated with CS. Information on optimal conditions for administering these agents should prove useful in guiding their clinical application Therefore, RMuLV should provide a good model for the preclinical evaluation and development of this class of agents for the treatment of HIV.","['Black, P l', 'Ussery, M A', 'Barney, S', 'Wittrock, R', 'DeMarsh, P', 'Dreyer, G B', 'Petteway, S R Jr', 'DalMonte, P', 'Baldoni, J', 'Lambert, D']","['Black Pl', 'Ussery MA', 'Barney S', 'Wittrock R', 'DeMarsh P', 'Dreyer GB', 'Petteway SR Jr', 'DalMonte P', 'Baldoni J', 'Lambert D']","['Division of Antiviral Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, HFD-535, US Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD 20857, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,IM,"['2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclodextrins/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligopeptides/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles/pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/blood', 'Rauscher Virus/*drug effects', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy/virology', '*beta-Cyclodextrins']",1996/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-3542(95)00831-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(95)00831-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1996 Mar;29(2-3):175-86. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(95)00831-4.,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Vehicles)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '146794-68-5 (SK&F 108922)', '1I96OHX6EK (2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",['1UO1AI25617/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Magnitude of the induced calcium signal in both cells exhibited the same dependence on hapten density of antigen molecules and there existed an optimal hapten density which induced the maximum amount of calcium signal for both cells. However, they responded differently to antigens of various molecular size. In contrast to TP67.21 cells which showed larger response to larger antigen molecules, RBL-2H3 cells showed the largest response to the smallest antigen. This may possibly suggest that there exists an optimal structure of receptor aggregates for each cell. Calcium signal induced in each cell by multivalent antigen was rapidly abrogated by addition of excess hapten and this abrogation occurred both in transmembrane influx and the release from intracellular stores. We directly observed the mobilization of receptor molecules during this calcium signal abrogation at single cell level by using two fluorescent calcium probes, whose fluorescence wavelength ranges have least overlap, and confocal microscopy. During this abrogation, large clusters of receptor molecules were not affected by hapten molecules. We, therefore, conclude that these large clusters are inactive in the induction of calcium signal and smaller clusters of receptor molecules are necessary for calcium signal induction.","['Torigoe, C', 'Nakanishi, M']","['Torigoe C', 'Nakanishi M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Haptens', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trinitrobenzenes/immunology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(96)02499-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(96)02499-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1996 Mar;49(3):169-74. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(96)02499-6.,,"['0 (Haptens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Trinitrobenzenes)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

By 2 weeks of age there were no differences in the levels of thyroid mononuclear cell infiltration between these and control animals. The role of mononuclear phagocytes in SAT was determined by their depletion via injecting newborn OS chicks with silica or carrageenan and dichloro-methylene diphosphonate encapsulated into liposomes. Although this treatment did not substantially change the amount of macrophages in primary lymphoid organs or blood, there was destruction of splenic architecture and, most importantly, mononuclear cell infiltration of the thyroids was significantly lower compared to controls. The role of activated macrophages in SAT is discussed.","['Hala, K', 'Malin, G', 'Dietrich, H', 'Loesch, U', 'Boeck, G', 'Wolf, H', 'Kaspers, B', 'Geryk, J', 'Falk, M', 'Boyd, R L']","['Hala K', 'Malin G', 'Dietrich H', 'Loesch U', 'Boeck G', 'Wolf H', 'Kaspers B', 'Geryk J', 'Falk M', 'Boyd RL']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Autoimmun,Journal of autoimmunity,8812164,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*complications', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Obesity/complications', 'Thyroiditis, Autoimmune/*etiology/immunology/virology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0896-8411(96)90016-5 [pii]', '10.1006/jaut.1996.0016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Autoimmun. 1996 Apr;9(2):129-38. doi: 10.1006/jaut.1996.0016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have developed a novel Env-expressing cell line for investigating the fusion process in a biologically significant system. Cell surface expression of the HIV-1 env gene, isolated from the highly fusogenic strain SF33, was obtained in the CD4-negative T cell line A2.01. To render the system versatile and efficient, HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev were supplied in trans. The presence of Env at the cell surface was shown by cytofluorometry and immunofluorescence and precursor processing of gp160 to gp120/gp41 was demonstrated by Western blot. The fusion capacity of A2.01-Env cells was assessed by coculture with CD4-positive T lymphocytes or the fusion indicator cell line, HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-Gal. By coincubation with CD4-positive T cells such as SupT1, A2.01-Env cells were observed to mediate rapidly numerous well-defined syncytia in a reproducible fashion. By expressing Tat, they also had the capacity to trans-activate the LTR-linked reporter beta-Gal gene following fusion with HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-Gal cells. The fusion-inhibiting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies Q425 and Q428 were used to block specifically Env-mediated fusion with CD4-positive cells and to demonstrate application of this system to the search for potential fusion-blocking agents. Our system thus offers a biologically significant model for studying fusion events with the advantages of being rapid, reproducible and versatile.","['Moir, S', 'Poulin, L']","['Moir S', 'Poulin L']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Fusion/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', '*Genes, env', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/genetics/physiology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/genetics/physiology', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/10 00:00,1996/06/10 00:01,['1996/06/10 00:00'],"['1996/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1996.12.811 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1996 Jun 10;12(9):811-20. doi: 10.1089/aid.1996.12.811.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of the cells was induced by antigen, or by the calcium ionophore A23187 (calcimycin) in combination with or without the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). For the active compounds, inhibition of exocytosis was found with all triggers, with the antigen trigger being somewhat more sensitive. This indicates that the compounds influence several steps in the signal transduction route leading to exocytosis. The activity of the compounds is not totally aspecific as small structural changes strongly affect the inhibiting activity. Introduction of a chlorine substituent at the 6-position of the benzimidazolone group results in loss of activity. There does not seem to be a significant activity difference between the benzimidazolone and benzimidazole analogues. Analogues with n < 3, n > 5 or a branched alkyl chain between the piperazinyl and the benzimidazol(on)e moiety lose inhibitory activity.

These findings suggest that IL-3 expressed intracellularly by gene transfection might act independently of the normal IL-3 receptor on autonomous cell growth and on IL-3-associated GD1a expression in murine myelogenous leukaemia NFS60 cells.","['Nakamura, M', 'Kirito, K', 'Tsunoda, A', 'Hara, K', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Saito, M']","['Nakamura M', 'Kirito K', 'Tsunoda A', 'Hara K', 'Furukawa Y', 'Saito M']","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Minamikawachi, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gangliosides/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00731500 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 1996 Apr;13(2):255-61. doi: 10.1007/BF00731500.,,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '12707-58-3 (ganglioside, GD1a)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the actual mechanisms mediating the inflammatory response, changes in cellular components and IL-8 level in pleural fluid of different aetiologies were evaluated. Thirty-four patients (19 male, 15 female) with a mean age of 46 +/- 22 years (range 16-92) were included in the study. Of these, 13 had tuberculous pleural effusion, seven had empyema/parapneumonic pleural effusion, and 14 had malignant pleural effusion (seven adenocarcinoma, three ovarian carcinoma, two lymphoma, one chronic myeloid leukaemia, and one small cell carcinoma) with positive cytology. Differential cell counts in the pleural fluid were obtained using cytocentrifuge preparations. The concentrations of IL-8 in pleural fluid were measured by the ELISA method. Interleukin-8 was detected in all 34 pleural fluid samples. The serum IL-8 level was analysed only in the empyema/parapneumonic pleural effusion group. The mean IL-8 levels of tuberculous, empyema/parapneumonic, and malignant pleural effusions were 1420 +/- 1049 pg ml-1, 4737 +/- 2297 pg ml-1, and 1574 +/- 1079 pg ml-1, respectively. The IL-8 levels in the empyema/parapneumonic group were significantly raised over malignant and tuberculous groups (P < 0.02). The mean pleural fluid neutrophil counts in tuberculous, empyema/parapneumonic and malignant pleural effusions were 315 +/- 575 cells mm-3, 11,136 +/- 12,452 cells mm-3, and 635 +/- 847 cells mm-3, respectively (P < 0.003). There was a significant positive correlation between pleural IL-8 levels and neutrophil counts (r = 0.46, P < 0.006). The levels of IL-8 in paired samples of serum and pleural fluid in the empyema/parapneumonic effusion group were compared, and the concentration of IL-8 was higher in the pleural effusion than serum (means, 4737 +/- 2297 pg ml-1 and 130.0 +/- 62.5 pg ml-1, respectively, P < 0.03). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-8 concentrations in serum and pleural fluid (r = -0.80, P < 0.03). This data suggests that production of IL-8 in pleural effusion may play a key role in initiation and maintenance of inflammatory reactions, especially in empyema/parapneumonic pleural effusions. It may offer the basis for introduction of novel anti-inflammatory agents in treatment.","['Ceyhan, B B', 'Ozgun, S', 'Celikel, T', 'Yalcin, M', 'Koc, M']","['Ceyhan BB', 'Ozgun S', 'Celikel T', 'Yalcin M', 'Koc M']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Heybeliada Chest Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Respir Med,Respiratory medicine,8908438,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Empyema, Pleural/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*analysis/blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/*immunology/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/immunology/pathology', 'Tuberculosis, Pleural/immunology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0954-6111(96)90290-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0954-6111(96)90290-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Respir Med. 1996 Apr;90(4):215-21. doi: 10.1016/s0954-6111(96)90290-5.,,['0 (Interleukin-8)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Bayes' law remains true when the parameters are obtained from the infinite population. Therefore a bias might exist in the previous information and affect BM predictive performance. To overcome this shortcoming, the blood drug concentration of a patient can be used to individualize his pharmacokinetic parameters. Until now, at least two sampling strategies, i.e. steady-state and non-steady-state sampling strategies, have been developed to individualize and predict blood drug concentration. In the present study we used five sampling strategies: (1) all samples; (2) post-infusion samples; (3) during-infusion samples; (4) samples within 95% confidence interval/interquartile range of a steady-state concentration; (5) the sample of the mean/median at the mid-time-point of a steady-state to individualize and predict blood cyclosporine concentrations in haematological patients with multidrug resistance. We investigated the effects of different sampling strategies on BM and the nonlinear least squared method (NLLSM) predictive performances. The results showed that BM predictive performance was better than NLLSM.

Magnesium frequently acts as a natural Ca2+ antagonist. In this study we have observed that Mg2+ can protect guinea-pigs against IS. Antigen-sensitized guinea-pigs, which had been fed a magnesium-deficient diet, were given a single dose (15 mg) of MgCl2 intraperitoneally 1 h before antigen challenge. The development of anaphylactic shock (AS) was observed during the next 2 h, and the hearts were subsequently examined histologically for signs of cardiac myolysis (CM). Magnesium (i) reduced the incidence of CM from 40% to 10% (p < 0.05); (ii) reduced the incidence of AS from 61% to 35% (p < 0.05); (iii) attenuated the severity of the AS; and (iv) lowered mortality from 39% in the control to 19% in the Mg(2+)-treated group (p = 0.1). Serum and tissue total [Mg2+] were not affected by the administration of MgCl2. Also, the serum and heart Mg2+ levels were the same whether or not the guinea-pigs developed AS or CM. In cell culture we demonstrated that by elevating the [Mg2+] in the medium bathing sensitized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] subsequent to antigen challenge was reduced from 174 +/- 23.28% (1 mM) to 82.74 +/- 13.22% (3 mM). We conclude that a single treatment with Mg2+ can considerably diminish damage induced by immune stress, probably by its altering the Ca2+: Mg2+ ratio. Since the physiological reaction to different types of stress is similar, Mg2+ could prove beneficial in preventing stress-induced shock in general. Studies examining the mechanisms by which Mg2+ exerts its effects thus provide a scientific basis for the current clinical use of Mg2+ in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and asthma.","['Kusniec, F', 'Fischer, G', 'Sela, B A', 'Ashkenazy, Y', 'Feigel, D', 'Moshonov, S', 'Zor, U']","['Kusniec F', 'Fischer G', 'Sela BA', 'Ashkenazy Y', 'Feigel D', 'Moshonov S', 'Zor U']","['Department of Hormone Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,9101750,IM,"['Anaphylaxis/complications/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Magnesium/blood/metabolism', 'Magnesium Chloride/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Magnesium Deficiency/complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Myocardial Infarction/drug therapy/pathology', 'Myocardium/metabolism/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol. 1994 Jan-Mar;5(1):45-58.,,"['0 (Antigens)', '02F3473H9O (Magnesium Chloride)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

I) in cell-attached configuration at potentials less negative than -40 mV an 8 ps channel was detected. The potential dependence of channel activity suggests that this is the TTX-sensitive Na+ channel. II) A cation-selective channel was observed with equal permeability for Na+ and K+ and a potential-independent single-channel conductance of 19 pS. The channel is activated by intracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by TEA, III) A predominantly anion-selective channel was identified with the selectivity sequence NO3- > J- > Cl- = Br- >> SO4(2-). The single-channel conductance shows outward rectification, and is in symmetrical NaCl solution 19 pS at -60 mV and 54pS at +50 mV. The open- and closed-time distributions suggest one open and at least four closed states. At submicromolar concentrations, the open state is blocked by H2DIDS leading to channel flicker between open and blocked channel; higher concentrations (apparent KI = 6.8 uM) lead to a longer-lasting blocked state. Both components of inhibition are reversible. IV) In addition, an 8 pS, Na(+)- and K(+)- selective channel could be induced by application of palytoxin. For channel activity, the presence of extracellular Na+ is essential. It is assumed that the Na+, K(+)-pump molecule is involved in the channel formation.

Of the six breast tumor samples examined, all expressed transcripts encoding IL-6 and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). Four of the samples also expressed transcripts for oncostatin M (OSM) and IL-11, and three expressed the IL-6 receptor. Adipose stromal cells expressed IL-6, IL-11 and LIF, but not the IL-6 receptor, consistent with previous conclusions that IL-6 activity in these cells required addition of IL-6 soluble receptor. In the case of T47D cells, expression of IL-11 protein was confirmed by immunotitration. Moreover, in these cells, expression of IL-11 transcripts was induced 3-fold by addition of estradiol to the culture medium. These results add credence to our previous proposal that breast cancer development is regulated in part by local autocrine and paracrine mechanisms via epithelial/mesenchymal interactions, in which estrogen produced by stromal cells surrounding the tumor acts to stimulate the production of growth factors and cytokines by the tumor cells. Some of these may act to stimulate further the growth and development of the tumor, while these or other factors may act on the surrounding mesenchymal cells in a paracrine fashion to stimulate aromatase expression in the presence of glucocorticoids. Thus, a positive feedback loop is established which leads to the development and growth of the tumor.","['Crichton, M B', 'Nichols, J E', 'Zhao, Y', 'Bulun, S E', 'Simpson, E R']","['Crichton MB', 'Nichols JE', 'Zhao Y', 'Bulun SE', 'Simpson ER']","['Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA 75235-9051.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Aromatase/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/*genetics/immunology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/immunology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/19 00:00,1996/04/19 00:01,['1996/04/19 00:00'],"['1996/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0303-7207(96)03761-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1996 Apr 19;118(1-2):215-20. doi: 10.1016/0303-7207(96)03761-6.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']","['5-T32-HD07190/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-A908174/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['Mol Cell Endocrinol 1996 Jul 1;120(2):215'],,,,

The mechanisms leading to these effects, however have not been fully elucidated. One of the underlying mechanisms is believed to be the oxidative damage caused by its metabolites. A comparative study was undertaken to examine the relationships between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation and subsequent cytotoxicity induced by five major benzene metabolites. The generation of ROS by benzene metabolites was demonstrated by the significant and dose-dependent increase of intracellular ROS formation in HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro. 1,4-Benzoquinone (BQ) was found to be the most potent metabolite in induction of ROS formation, followed by 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) and to a lesser extent, phenol (PH) and trans, trans-muconaldehyde (MD). No significant effect was observed when the cells were treated with trans, trans-muconic acid (MA). The enhancement of ROS production by BQ was effectively inhibited by the addition of catalase, deferoxamine (DFO) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but unchanged by superoxide dismutase (SOD), suggest that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) are the two major forms of ROS involved. The results also demonstrate that the ability of benzene metabolites in enhancing ROS generation is closely correlated to their capacity in causing lipid peroxidation and subsequent cytotoxicity. These findings together with earlier parallel observations on DNA damage suggest that ROS play an important role in the mechanism of carcinogenesis induced by benzene metabolites.","['Shen, Y', 'Shen, H M', 'Shi, C Y', 'Ong, C N']","['Shen Y', 'Shen HM', 'Shi CY', 'Ong CN']","['Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,IM,"['Aldehydes/metabolism/toxicity', 'Benzene Derivatives/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism/toxicity', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Phenols/metabolism/toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/096032719601500510 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 1996 May;15(5):422-7. doi: 10.1177/096032719601500510.,,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', '3249-28-3 (muconaldehyde)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Histochemical localization of activity in frozen sections was compared with immunohistochemical localization in paraffin sections of the same tissue specimens. The activity and antigenicity of this enzyme were detected in decidual cells, syncytiotrophoblast, and some macrophages distributed throughout maternal and embryonic tissues, but not in neutrophils. Unlike other tissues previously examined, placenta contains significant numbers of the phosphate-positive cells that are not of macrophage origin.","['Janckila, A J', 'Yaziji, H', 'Lear, S C', 'Martin, A W', 'Yam, L T']","['Janckila AJ', 'Yaziji H', 'Lear SC', 'Martin AW', 'Yam LT']","['Medicine Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Histochem J,The Histochemical journal,0163161,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Macrophages/chemistry/cytology', 'Muramidase/analysis', 'Placenta/cytology/*enzymology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase', 'alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin/analysis', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/analysis']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02331443 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem J. 1996 Mar;28(3):195-200. doi: 10.1007/BF02331443.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In Sweden, train personnel are exposed to comparatively strong magnetic fields in their work. The aim of the present study was to investigate cancer incidence, particularly leukemia and brain tumors, among male railway engine drivers and conductors, respectively, and to compare their cancer incidence with that of the general male population. The study population comprised all male railway engine drivers (n = 7,466) and conductors (n = 2,272) who were ever employed at the Swedish State Railways during the period 1976-90. The study population was observed with regard to cancer incidence by means of the National Cancer Register for the period 1976-90. The total cancer incidence (all tumors included) among railway engine drivers was lower than in the general Swedish population. An increased incidence of lymphocytic leukemia was observed among railway engine drivers and conductors combined (relative risk = 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval = 1.3-3.2), with the same point estimate for both occupational groups. For brain tumor (astrocytoma), the observed relative risk was close to one. The study provides evidence of an excess risk of lymphocytic leukemia in railway engine drivers and conductors, workers with known occupational exposure to magnetic fields.","['Alfredsson, L', 'Hammar, N', 'Karlehagen, S']","['Alfredsson L', 'Hammar N', 'Karlehagen S']","['Division of Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Astrocytoma/epidemiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Magnetics/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Population Surveillance', '*Railroads', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00052944 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1996 May;7(3):377-81. doi: 10.1007/BF00052944.,,,,,,,,['Cancer Causes Control. 1996 May;7(3):299-301.

The hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which is a shortened chromosome 22 (22q-) resulting from a reciprocal translocation involving chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, designed t (9;22) (q34;q11). This translocation juxtaposes parts of two genes; ABL on chromosome 9 and BCR (breakpoint cluster region) on chromosome 22. Transcription of the BCR/ABL fusion gene results in an hybrid mRNA that is translated into a 210 kDa or 190 kDa protein, depending on the location of the breakpoint in the bcr region. This protein plays a key role in CML: its tyrosine-kinase activity, that differs from the normal ABL product, may be involved in leukemic cell growth. Nonetheless, the loss of the negative cell growth regulation by c-ABL, or BCR/ABL fusion protein interaction with other cellular genes (such as RAS or c-MYC) could also be involved in CML pathophysiology. A better understanding of the molecular mecanisms of CML could lead to specific treatment, such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, or site-specific DNA-binding proteins designed against BCR/ABL oncogenic fusion sequence.","['Costello, R', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Sainty, D', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Gabert, J']","['Costello R', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Sainty D', 'Gastaut JA', 'Gabert J']","[""Departement d'hematologie generale, institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/physiopathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0248866396812483 [pii]', '10.1016/0248-8663(96)81248-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 1996;17(3):213-23. doi: 10.1016/0248-8663(96)81248-3.,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,"La leucemie myeloide chronique, aspects biologiques.",139,,,,,,,,

Several members of the IL-6 subfamily induced anorexia, IL-11 was the most potent, LIF the most effective, and OSM had no effect. The results suggest that IL-6 subfamily members act centrally to decrease feeding and this effect may participate in the anorexia which frequently accompanies pathological processes.

In spite of these potential disadvantages: advanced disease, HLA antigen disparate donor and significant maternal T cell contamination, the transplant was successful and at a follow-up of 14 months the child is well with no evidence of chronic GVHD.

Granulocytic sarcoma can involve any site of the body, presenting as a soft tissue mass; it occurred in body cavities (eg pleural cavity, abdominal cavity, spinal canal, stomach and bladder), the head and neck region (orbit, ear, skull base, peripheral nerves), the trunk and limbs, and mammary and sex glands. Granulocytic sarcoma predicts an additional hazard to outcome after BMT. Nine of 26 patients (33%) were alive 15-151 months after the onset of granulocytic sarcoma.

Between 1982 and 1993, 73 patients with CML who underwent ASCT were evaluated. Twenty-eight patients had signs of transformation, 20 were in second or subsequent CP, 22 had CML-CP and had shown resistance to or were unable to tolerate IFN-alpha therapy, and there had Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-negative CML. Survival of patients in CML-CP who underwent ASCT was compared to controls who were in first CP receiving INF-a therapy. Patients and controls were matched for age, decade of therapy, response to IFN-alpha therapy (resistance vs toxicity) and the time to ASCT (study group) vs time to resistance (control group). Nine 12% patients failed to achieve hematologic recovery, and five (7%) had early death secondary to toxicity. Twenty-seven (58%) patients who received transplants in advanced-stage CML and 18 (82%) transplanted in CML-CP achieved complete hematologic remission (CHR). The incidence of complete cytogenetic response was 10 and 14%, respectively. The median survival of these two groups of patients was 5 and 34 months, respectively (P < 0.001). However, the survival of patients in CML-CP was not significantly different from controls (34 vs 49 months; P = 0.17). We conclude that unpurged ASCT does not prolong the survival of patients in CML-CP who are resistant to IFN-alpha therapy.

The disease-freed survival of RA patients and patients presenting with RAEB, RAEBt and AML but transplanted in complete remission, was respectively 50 and 60%. On the contrary, none of the nine high-risk MDS patients transplanted with persistent disease, survived. Outcome after transplantation with alternative donors was inferior with one long-term survivor, mainly related to the high incidence of severe acute GVHD and its accompanying infectious complications.

When no sibling donor is available, identifying and unrelated donor in a timely fashion can be difficult while autologous BMT (ABMT) can be performed more quickly. We have studied the outcome of 115 consecutive referrals of patients with ALL to the University of Minnesota for BMT between September 1991 and August 1993 to determine the feasibility of URD identification and BMT in these patients. In 40 cases (35%) a related allogeneic donor was identified and 30 of these patients received BMT at Minnesota. Our policy for patients with no related donor (n = 75) was to initiate an unrelated donor (URD) search and seek insurance authorization for both URD and ABMT immediately on referral; URD BMT is offered if a donor is available within 4 months. Thereafter ABMT is offered if an URD is no yet available. Fifty-eight patients (50% of referrals) initiated an URD search.

Thirty-eight patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia (17 patients chronic phase, 13 patients accelerated phase, eight patients blast phase), 19 patients had acute leukemia (second complete remission or relapse) and eight patients had myelodysplasia. The patients were transplanted at four different medical centers from July 1988 to November 1992. Ages ranged 4-48 years (median 32). Fifty-seven patients received busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, and eight received busulfan at doses between 15 and 17 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide at doses 100-200 mg/kg as preparative regimens. All patients received cyclosporine for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis; in addition 46 patients received corticosteroid, 38 methotrexate, six anti-CD5 ricin A-immunotoxin, and four T cell-depleted bone marrow. Median follow-up of survivors was 53 months (range 15-68 months). Four year actuarial survival was 24 +/- 12%. Four-year survival based on disease was 29 +/- 27% for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, 20 +/- 9% for chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase, 0% for chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase, 32 +/- 40% for acute leukemia, and 38 +/- 34% for myelodysplasia. Actuarial survival was 66 +/- 40% in patients age < 20 years, vs 23 +/- 13% for patients ages 20 to 40, and 10 +/- 14% for patients age > 40 years. Fifty patients (88%) engrafted.

In the HPRBC assay, rhGH is combined with an excess of the soluble extracellular domain of the recombinant human growth hormone receptor (referred to as 'receptor' in the discussion of the HPRBC assay). Nondenaturing size-exclusion chromatography is used to analyzed the resulting complex, which forms in a 2:1 receptor to rhGH ratio. The 2:1 complex is assayed at a concentration near the Kd (approximately 0.4 nM), providing high specificity for rhGH and detection of rhGH variants with reduced activity. In the CP assay, a mouse myeloid leukaemia cell line (FDC-P1) transfected with the full-length receptor is exposed to varying levels of rhGH for 16-20 h. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA is used as an index of cell proliferation. The results show that the HPRBC assay provides significantly improved precision with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of < or = 5% vs. an RSD of 23% for the rat bioassay. The CP assay has RSDs of 4-16%. Analysis of rhGH variants and mutants shows that the potencies measured by both the HPRBC and CP assays are in general agreement with the rat weight gain bioassay. Both of the HPRBC and CP assays are sufficiently rugged for operating in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) routine batch release testing environment. In vitro alternatives such as the HPRBC and CP assays build a foundation for replacing the hypophysectomized rat weight gain bioassay by correlating receptor dimerization, binding specificity and signal transduction with the biological activity of rhGH.","['Roswall, E C', 'Mukku, V R', 'Chen, A B', 'Hoff, E H', 'Chu, H', 'McKay, P A', 'Olson, K C', 'Battersby, J E', 'Gehant, R L', 'Meunier, A', 'Garnick, R L']","['Roswall EC', 'Mukku VR', 'Chen AB', 'Hoff EH', 'Chu H', 'McKay PA', 'Olson KC', 'Battersby JE', 'Gehant RL', 'Meunier A', 'Garnick RL']","['Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080-4990, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biologicals,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,9004494,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/chemistry/*metabolism/standards', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Hypophysectomy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Weight Gain']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1045-1056(96)90003-2 [pii]', '10.1006/biol.1996.0003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biologicals. 1996 Mar;24(1):25-39. doi: 10.1006/biol.1996.0003.,,"['0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Biochemically, the condition is characterized by a relative resistance to glucocorticoids that can be compensated for by the elevated levels of cortisol. The inheritance pattern of GIGR is incompletely understood, and one of the central questions is whether there is a correlation between genotype and phenotype. Analysis of mutations within the receptor resulting in relative glucocorticoid resistance has identified two regions of clustered mutations in the proximity of previously identified affinity-labeled residues, the putative steroid-binding site. In the majority of cases, the mutation affects steroid binding and transactivation to the same degree, with the exceptions suggesting an explanation for the variability of the clinical manifestations. From a clinical point of view, in addition to preexisting genetic resistance to glucocorticoids, it is important to consider acquired changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene structure and organization, including alterations of noncoding sequences, and the importance of the resultant mutations, deletions, and other changes affecting receptor function. Finally, studies of New World primates and cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies constitute animal and human models for the molecular basis of glucocorticoid resistance where a number of inherited and acquired mutations in the GR gene have been demonstrated.","['Werner, S', 'Bronnegard, M']","['Werner S', 'Bronnegard M']","['Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Steroids,Steroids,0404536,IM,"['Animals', 'Arvicolinae', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Saguinus', 'Syndrome']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0039-128X(96)00017-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0039-128x(96)00017-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Steroids. 1996 Apr;61(4):216-21. doi: 10.1016/0039-128x(96)00017-7.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",,,,42,,,,,,,,

Evidence for primary or secondary responses to CMV was sought by determining IgG antibody avidity using an avidity index method, and antibody titre over a period of up to 3 years after transplant. For the patients whose donors were CMV seropositive, the results showed the characteristics of a secondary response, i.e., rising antibody titres of high avidity immediately after transplant. In contrast, the patients with CMV seronegative donors showed evidence of a primary antibody response usually occurring at about 250 days after transplant, i.e., rising antibody levels initially of low avidity maturing to high avidity over the following 100 to 200 days.

The present work investigates the role of GHR and JAK2 in the activation of Stats 1, 3, and 5 by GH. The ability of GH to stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of these Stats was assessed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing truncated and mutated GHR. GH was observed to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stats 1, 3, and 5 in CHO cells expressing GHRs that bind JAK2 [GHR1-638 (full-length) and GHR1-454 (lacks approximately half of the cytoplasmic domain)] but not in CHO cells expressing GHR that do not bind JAK2 (GHR1-318 or GHR1-294). GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stat5, but not Stats 1 or 3, was reduced in CHO cells expressing GHR1-454. GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stats 3 and 5 was severely reduced and undetectable for Stat1 in cells expressing GHR1-454 in which tyrosines 333 and 338 (the only tyrosines phosphorylated within 1-454) are mutated to phenylalanine (GHR1-454Y333, 338F). However, GH-dependent phosphorylation of Stats 1, 3, and 5 was observed in cells expressing full-length GHR in which tyrosines 333 and 338 are mutated to phenylalanine (GHR1-638Y333, 338F) GH, whose receptor lacks previously defined Stat1- or Stat3-binding sites, was found in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts and 2fTGH-GHR cells to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 to a substantially greater extent than, and JAK1 to a similar extent as, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and/or interferon gamma (IFN gamma), ligands whose receptors contains Stat3- and Stat1-binding sites and activate Stat3 and Stat1, respectively, better than GH. These findings suggest that: 1) JAK2 is required for GH-dependent phosphorylation of Stats 1, 3, and 5; 2) tyrosines 333 and/or 338 are required for maximal tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stats 1, 3, and 5; 3) Stat5 binds to a phosphorylated tyrosine(s) within amino acids 454-638 in addition to tyrosines 333 and/or 338; 4) GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1 in addition to JAK2 with JAK2 having a much greater response; 5) some Stat3 and Stat5 (and possibly Stat1) may bind to nonphosphorylated amino acids in GHR or to phosphorylated tyrosines in proteins that bind to GHR (e.g. JAK22) to be maximally activated; and 6) if JAK2, which contains Stat3-binding motifs, does serve as a docking site for some Stat proteins, Stat-JAK2 binding is likely to be more important for GH than LIF or IFN gamma in 3T3-F442A cells since GH induces 15 times more tyrosyl-phosphorylated JAK2 than LIF or IFN gamma.","['Smit, L S', 'Meyer, D J', 'Billestrup, N', 'Norstedt, G', 'Schwartz, J', 'Carter-Su, C']","['Smit LS', 'Meyer DJ', 'Billestrup N', 'Norstedt G', 'Schwartz J', 'Carter-Su C']","['Department of Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 49109-0622, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Growth Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.10.5.8732683 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1996 May;10(5):519-33. doi: 10.1210/mend.10.5.8732683.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']","['R01 DK034171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1 RR00042/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-34171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have used a U937 monocytic leukemia cell line stably expressing a c-jun dominant-negative, transactivation-domain deletion mutant (TAM67) to assess the role of c-jun in apoptotic events induced by exposure to the antimetabolite 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). Mutant cells produce a truncated M(r) 29,000 protein that interferes with the function of normal c-Jun (and c-Fos) proteins through a quenching mechanism. Parental U937, cells expressing TAM67, and cells carrying only the empty vector (pMM) were exposed to ara-C for 6 h, and apoptosis was monitored by cell morphology as well as qualitative and quantitative assays of DNA damage. No differences in apoptosis could be detected between the three cell lines at any of the ara-C concentrations evaluated. In addition, ara-C concentrations > or = 1.0 x 10(-6) M were equally inhibitory to the clonogenic growth of U937 and TAM67-expressing cells. In contrast, lower concentrations of ara-C (i.e., < 5.0 x 10(-7) M) were significantly less inhibitory to mutant U937 cell colony formation than to their parental counterparts. The reduced sensitivity of TAM67-expressing cells to low concentrations of ara-C could not be attributed to biochemical or cytokinetic factors, since the two cell lines were indistinguishable with respect to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) formation, ara-CTP:dCTP ratios, and S-phase fraction. However, a significantly lower percentage of TAM67-expressing cells exposed to submicromolar concentrations of ara-C exhibited features associated with a differentiated monocytoid phenotype (i.e., increased plastic adherence and CD11b expression) compared to their parental counterparts. Lower concentrations of ara-C were also significantly less effective in decreasing the percentage of S-phase cells and in down-regulating c-myc mRNA levels in the mutant line, events associated with induction of leukemic cell differentiation. Finally, ara-C-induced up-regulation of c-jun message and protein was markedly attenuated in TAM67-expressing cells, findings consistent with a c-jun dominant-negative model. Collectively, these findings suggest that dysregulation of c-jun in U937 cells antagonizes low-dose ara-C-mediated cellular maturation but does not prevent higher concentration of this agent from triggering apoptosis. They also raise the possibility that separate aspects of the antiproliferative actions of ara-C may be differentially regulated by c-jun.","['Grant, S', 'Freemerman, A J', 'Birrer, M J', 'Martin, H A', 'Turner, A J', 'Szabo, E', 'Chelliah, J', 'Jarvis, W D']","['Grant S', 'Freemerman AJ', 'Birrer MJ', 'Martin HA', 'Turner AJ', 'Szabo E', 'Chelliah J', 'Jarvis WD']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxins/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 May;7(5):603-13.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']","['CA 09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA 66990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work, the effects of human PF 4 on megakaryocyte (MK) growth from human CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells were studied in comparison with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Development of MK from CD34+ cells in both plasma clot culture and liquid culture was significantly inhibited by PF 4 (5 micrograms/ml) and TGF beta 1 (1 ng/ml). Inhibition of cell growth by PF 4 was reversible judging from the fact that the CD34+ cells preincubated with PF 4 could regenerate colonies after washing and replating into the cultures. By contrast, TGF-beta 1 pretreated CD34+ cells gave rise to few colonies following replating. Moreover, incubation of CD34+ cells with PF 4 in liquid culture caused an increase in the number of both stem cell factor (SCF)-binding cells and CD34 antigen-bearing cells, and exhibited greater capacity to form MK colonies than control after the treatment of 5-FU. In vivo in mice, twice injections of PF 4 at 40 micrograms/kg with an interval of 6 h followed by one injection of 5-FU at 150 mg/kg resulted in a significant increase in the number of colony-forming cells with high proliferative potential (HPP-CFC) and colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) in bone marrow. In exponentially growing human erythroleukemia cells (HEL), the addition of PF 4 prolonged cell cycle progression and therefore resulted in an increased cell population in S phase, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Different from PF 4, TGF-beta 1 blocked more cells in G 1 phase. These results demonstrate that PF 4 and TFG-beta 1 inhibit MK development from CD34+ CB cells by different mechanisms and suggest that PF 4, unlike TGF-beta 1, exerts its inhibitory effect on cell growth in a reversible and S phasespecific manner by which it protects stem cells and MK progenitor cells from 5-FU cytotoxicity.","['Han, Z C', 'Zhang, X J', 'Xi, X D', 'Lu, M', 'Jiang, S', 'Jiang, L Z', 'Wang, X M', 'Gu, G L', 'Caen, J P']","['Han ZC', 'Zhang XJ', 'Xi XD', 'Lu M', 'Jiang S', 'Jiang LZ', 'Wang XM', 'Gu GL', 'Caen JP']","['Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Academia Sinica.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,0413570,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Coagulants/*pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fluorouracil/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Platelet Factor 4/*pharmacology', 'S Phase', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 1995 Dec;28(4):415-26.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Coagulants)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Approach by confocal laser microspectrofluorometry].,9-15,"Confocal microspectrofluorometry allows the analysis of fluorescent molecules such as anthracylines in isolated living cells. An optical microscope fitted with a phase-contrast 100 X water-immersion objective enables simultaneous observation of the sample, focusing of the laser beam on the selected cell fraction (nucleus) and collection of the fluorescence emitted from the sample. The resulting intranuclear spectra are interpreted according to a quantitative model of the fluorescence spectra of both free and DNA-bound anthracycline. The intranuclear drug concentration can thus be determined. This technique has been applied to blast cells collected in patients with acute leukemia. Leukemic cells are aspirated from bone marrow, separated by Ficoll sedimentation and resuspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 200 nM tetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicin (THP-DOX). After one hour, 20 cells are analyzed and the mean nuclear drug content is determined (C1). Cells are then resuspended in the same medium but without anthracycline for 3 hours and the mean intranuclear drug concentration is then also determined (C3). From C1 and C3 the retention rate (RR) is calculated. Firstly, the accuracy of the method was checked. In 4 AML patients, two different samples aspirated on the same day were divided into two portions. Thus, two measurements were made on each one (4 values per patient). Coefficients of variation were satisfactory (4, 6, 12, and 12%). Secondly, blast cells collected in patients with AML and ALL at diagnosis or in relapse were studied. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CD34 expression was also studied using respectively immunohistochemistry land flow cytometry. Results obtained from the first 21 patients showed that there was no correlation between RR and either P-gp or CD34 expression. This could result from the efflux of THP-DOX by other mechanisms and/or low sensitivity of the staining technique.","['Morjani, H', 'Pignon, B', 'Vilque, J P', 'Millot, J M', 'Lartigue, B', 'Simon, G', 'Etienne, J C', 'Potron, G', 'Manfait, M']","['Morjani H', 'Pignon B', 'Vilque JP', 'Millot JM', 'Lartigue B', 'Simon G', 'Etienne JC', 'Potron G', 'Manfait M']","['Laboratoire de spectroscopie biomoleculaire, UFR de pharmacie, Reims, France.']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'Microspectrophotometry/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 1996;54(1):9-15.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)']",,,Evaluation du phenotype de la resistance pleiotropique sur des prelevements medullaires de patients presentant une leucemie aigue par mesure de l'efflux nucleaire de la tetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicine.

Therefore, when aged individuals present with AML, it is a necessity and a challenge to treat them as efficiently as possible. AML is mainly a disease of the elderly and accounts for more than 50% of its incidence among the general population. The treatment of older individuals with AML has remained difficult and its success is still limited. While in adults with AML of less than 60 years complete responses above 65% and survival rates of 35% are commonly obtained, progress in the treatment of elderly patients has been relatively small. As of today, approximately 50% of older patients may be induced into remission with chemotherapy, and, among these complete responders, only approximately 1 in 10 will survive free of leukaemia beyond 4 years after diagnosis. In fact, on one hand, these results represent the rationale and motivation for offering chemotherapy to the older population. On the other hand, they emphasize that major obstacles to better cure rates still exist. These stumbling blocks apparently relate to the restricted tolerance of older subjects to the exposure of chemotherapy and probably also a greater probability of unresponsiveness of the leukaemia to cytotoxic therapy. The haematopoietic growth factors still hold some promise and may improve outcome, but for the time being there is insufficient direct evidence to indicate a defined and established role. It is evident that new avenues should be pursued and trials specifically designed for elderly people with AML be conducted. These trials would need to address questions related to the choice of chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. idarubicin versus mitoxantrone), their dose and schedule selection, the use of multidrug resistance modulators (to overcome intrinsic drug non-responsiveness), and the optimal clinical use of haematopoietic growth factors, including thrombopoietin. Since trials addressing specific questions regarding the development of treatment of elderly patients with AML have remained scarce, the initiation of these studies is sorely needed. One may hope that these clinical trials will provide some of the necessary answers and new clues, and will be useful to advance future therapy of elderly AML patients.","['Lowenberg, B']",['Lowenberg B'],"['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80041-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1996 Mar;9(1):147-59. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80041-2.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",,,,49,,,,,,,,

ATRA followed by chemotherapy also reduces the incidence of relapse (particularly of early relapse) as compared to chemotherapy alone. However, treatment with ATRA is still complicated by the risk of hyperleukocytosis and potentially fatal ATRA syndrome, whose best preventive approach (addition of chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone) is still debated. Because some patients still relapse after ATRA plus chemotherapy, prognostic factors for relapse need to be precisely determined. They certainly include persistence or re-appearance of PML-RAR transcript during follow-up. Allogeneic BMT should be considered in those patients. Most of the patients who are not cured by the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy or by subsequent allogeneic BMT still die from their disease. This is due to the acquisition by APL cells of progressive resistance to ATRA, that appears to depend on induction of increased ATRA catabolism in APL cells.

Of all late effects of treatment, secondary leukaemia is one of the most serious. Increased risk of AML has been observed both after RT and after CT; however, several types of CT have much stronger leukaemogenic properties than RT. Limited field radiation in the therapeutic dose range is associated with very little or no increased risk of leukaemia, which has been attributed to cell killing at the higher radiation doses. With respect to CT, two different syndromes of treatment-related AML have been recognized. Risk of alkylating agent-related AML is highest in the 5-10 year follow-up period and seems to decrease afterwards. This type of leukaemia is often preceded by MDS, and is characterized by deletions of chromosomes 5 and 7. Leukaemias related to treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitors are characterized by a short induction period, presentation as myelomonocytic or monocytic leukaemia (rather than MDS) and balanced chromosomal translocations involving bands 11q23 and 21q22. This review addresses the risk of secondary AML and MDS following treatment of HD, NHL, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and paediatric malignancies. In patients with HD, the risk of AML is higher with an increasing number of mechlorethamine-procarbazine-containing cycles, a greater number of CT episodes, and after splenectomy. The majority of data shows that RT does not add to the leukaemia risk from CT, but this issue is still surrounded by some controversy. ABV(D)-treated patients have a very low risk of AML. Generally, patients with NHL, testicular cancer and breast cancer experience much lower risk of AML than patients with HD. NHL and breast cancer treatment regimens with cumulative cyclophosphamide doses of 20 g or less do not confer an appreciable increase of AML. Recently, strongly increased AML risk has been observed following autologous bone marrow transplantation and other dose intensification strategies. Risk factors for this excess remain to be defined. PVB treatment for testicular cancer is not followed by increased leukaemia risk, but modern etoposide-containing regimens do confer excess risk, of which the magnitude at conventional drug doses is not yet well known. High risk of leukaemia has been reported in children treated with epipodophyllotoxins. The leukaemogenic hazards of cancer treatment should be weighed against their therapeutic benefits.","['van Leeuwen, F E']",['van Leeuwen FE'],"['Department of Epidemiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80037-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1996 Mar;9(1):57-85. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80037-0.,,,,,,115,,,,,,,,

Immunological studies of myeloid leukaemic blasts has become critical also in identifying biphenotypic leukaemias and AML expressing lymphoid-associated markers (Ly+ AML). At present, while the prognostic value of individual antigen expressions is still controversial, due to technical questions, the immunological detection of MRD seems to be important in monitoring AML patients in remission and, perhaps, in detecting leukaemic cell contamination into bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells collected for autologous transplantation. In addition, the relationship established between genetic abnormalities and certain phenotypes within different FAB subtypes suggests that, in the future, immunophenotypical studies could be used for the screening of AML cases carrying specific genetic aberrations. Compared to acute leukaemias, little information is available concerning immunological patterns in MDS, and the role of the immunophenotype in diagnosis, subclassification, and prognosis of MDS is currently not well established.","['Sanz, M A', 'Sempere, A']","['Sanz MA', 'Sempere A']","['Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Prognosis']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80036-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1996 Mar;9(1):35-55. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80036-9.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,146,,,,,,,,

We have previously used Southern blotting as a definitive method for the diagnosis of monoclonal lymphoproliferation in these disorders, but this is expensive, lengthy and technically difficult.

We found an excellent correlation between the 2 methods in demonstrating monoclonal populations of lymphocytes in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CLL or SLVL. We have further demonstrated monoclonality in a patient who could not be classified as CLL or SLVL on clinical criteria alone.

Mantle cell lymphoma is strongly associated with the t(11;14) chromosomal translocation that rearranges the bcl-1 oncogene (PRAD-1 gene) and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. In this study, we developed a nested polymerase chain reaction system to evaluate the t(11;14) translocation. The study material consisted of 10 mantle cell lymphomas fulfilling the criteria suggested by other authors (P. M. Banks et al. Surg Pathol 16:637, 1992). A novel nested polymerase chain reaction system was used to evaluate the bcl-1 breaks in the major translocation cluster using two successive polymerase chain reaction amplifications. This reaction yielded a background-free single product of the size of 200 to 300 base pairs in four of 10 mantle cell lymphomas. The identity of the product from the nested polymerase chain reaction was confirmed by Southern blotting followed by hybridization with a specific probe. The amplification products were also evaluated by Sst-I, Alu-I, Dde-I, and Ita-I restriction enzymes and showed different patterns of digestion reflecting individual differences between the MTC/ IgH junctions. A selection of other low-grade lymphomas, including lymphocytic, follicular, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia and 29 hyperplastic lymph nodes were negative. This nested polymerase chain reaction system for the t(11;14) translocation involving major translocation cluster offers a convenient specific identification for mantle cell lymphoma. However, this test has a limited diagnostic power because only about half of the mantle cell lymphomas show the bcl-1 breaks in the major translocation cluster. The test performs well in formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded material, allowing the study of large numbers of retrospective cases of mantle cell lymphomas.","['Lasota, J', 'Franssila, K', 'Koo, C H', 'Miettinen, M']","['Lasota J', 'Franssila K', 'Koo CH', 'Miettinen M']","['Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1996 Apr;9(4):361-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the benefits of GH replacement therapy in adults become increasingly appreciated, it is likely that GH therapy started in childhood for GH deficiency will be continued into adult life in many of those with severe GH deficiency. The aim of this study is to determine how many patients who received GH replacement therapy in childhood until completion of growth have GH deficiency severe enough to be considered for GH replacement therapy in adult life. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the peak GH responses to provocative stimuli performed at the time of diagnosis of GH deficiency in childhood and at the completion of growth after GH replacement therapy had been stopped. PATIENTS: Eighty-eight adults (49 male, 39 female) who had received GH therapy in childhood for a diagnosis of GH deficiency. The aetiology of the GH deficiency included craniopharyngioma, radiation induced associated with either a cerebral tumour or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, histiocytosis-X and idiopathic. MEASUREMENTS: In childhood the original diagnosis of GH deficiency was based biochemically on the failure of the peak GH response to reach 20 mU/l during two provocative tests in 59 of the 88 patients and to a single test in the remaining 29. A total of 147 tests were performed, the most common being an insulin tolerance test (ITT, n = 72) and an arginine stimulation test (AST, n = 53). At reassessment in young adult life 146 tests were performed (74 ITT, 64 AST). Severe GH deficiency was defined arbitrarily as a peak GH response of less than 9 mU/l to a single (n = 33) or to two (n = 55) pharmacological stimuli. RESULTS: By definition all patients were considered GH deficient at the time of initial diagnosis. A peak GH response of less than 9 mU/l was seen in 64.8% at initial assessment and 60.2% at reassessment. Analysis in aetiological terms, however, showed that between assessments the incidence of severe GH deficiency increased in the group of radiation induced (48.8 vs. 55.8%) but decreased in the idiopathic group (78.1 vs. 53.1%). Out of the 55 patients who underwent two tests at reassessment, 47.3% of those with a GH peak less than 9 mU/l at one test had a GH peak greater than 9 mU/l at the second test. Fifteen of the 55 patients had additional pituitary hormone deficiencies and all 15 had a GH peak below 9 mU/l in both tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that all children who have received GH replacement therapy in childhood should undergo reassessment of GH status in young adult life. Between 40 and 60% of such patients merit consideration for GH therapy in adult life depending on the definition of severe GH deficiency in use. Patients with isolated GH deficiency should undergo two provocative tests of GH secretion, but those with additional anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies require only one test at reassessment.","['Nicolson, A', 'Toogood, A A', 'Rahim, A', 'Shalet, S M']","['Nicolson A', 'Toogood AA', 'Rahim A', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiency/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1996.671492.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1996 Mar;44(3):311-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1996.671492.x.,,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,['Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1996 Mar;44(3):317.

We compared the erythropoietin receptor in Friend virus transformed murine erythroleukemic F4N and 707 cell lines with the J2E erythroid line generated by the J2 retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase PCR was used to determine transcript size. Erythropoietin receptor cDNAs were then sequenced and protein products analysed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. We show here that the F4N murine erythroleukemic cell line had an enlarged erythropoietin receptor mRNA. In contrast, the 707 and J2E cell line had normal sized transcripts for the receptor. Sequence analysis of the receptor in F4N cells revealed that introns which separate the exons coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor were retained in these transcripts. As a consequence, a premature stop codon had been introduced, leaving only four amino acids in the intracellular portion of the receptor molecule. The normal erythropoietin receptor is approx. 66-70 kDa, but immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine/cysteine labelled cell lysates with an antibody to the amino-terminus of the erythropoietin receptor identified a truncated 37 kDa protein in F4N cells. Despite the severe carboxy-terminal truncation of the erythropoietin receptor, F4N cells continued to proliferate like the other murine erythroleukemia cell lines. This study shows that failure to remove introns from the erythropoietin receptor mRNA in F4N cells has resulted in the production of a smaller protein with virtually no cytoplasmic domain.","['Bittorf, T', 'Busfield, S J', 'Klinken, S P', 'Tilbrook, P A']","['Bittorf T', 'Busfield SJ', 'Klinken SP', 'Tilbrook PA']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Australia, Nedlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*chemistry']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['135727259500128X [pii]', '10.1016/1357-2725(95)00128-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1996 Feb;28(2):175-81. doi: 10.1016/1357-2725(95)00128-x.,,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a study to evaluate the relative importance of distance to power lines and calculated historical magnetic fields when estimating past magnetic field exposure. Another goal was to compare results based on various estimates of magnetic field exposure, to assess the importance of short-term variability in magnetic fields, time between diagnosis and measurement, and sources of magnetic field exposure. We used data from a Swedish case-control study of residential exposure to magnetic fields and cancer. Childhood leukemia risk was associated with calculated historical annual average magnetic fields regardless of distance, and the association with distance disappeared when both variables were entered into the same logistic regression model. Relative risks for measurements at the time of the study (contemporary annual average fields, spot calculations, and spot measurements) were all close to or below unity.

In cytotoxicity assay with L929 cells, one mutant, designated as TNF-B, showed 4.5-fold higher activity than TNF examined.

In receptor binding assay, TNF-B had almost the same affinity for TNF receports on L929 cells as hTNF-alpha. But another mutant, TNFarg, markedly decreased the all activities of hTNF-alpha and had lower affinity for receports on different types of target cell. These results indicated that the relative activity of TNFs to target cells may correlate with their affinity for receports. We also found that TNF-B retained the cytotoxicity of hTNF-alpha for HEp-2 cells. TNF-B also had two-fold higher affinity than hTNF-alpha for receptors on HEp-2 cells (only carrying hTNF-R55) and lower affinity for receptors on U937 cells (expressing mainly hTNF-R75). These results suggested that TNF-B might still interact with the human TNF-R55 receptor, but it might largely lose its ability to bind to human TNF-R75.

The generation of neurons from these clones can be stimulated by either a factor derived from an astrocyte precursor line, Ast-1, or FGF-1. We have shown that neuronal differentiation stimulated by FGF-1 can be inhibited by diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor and mimicked by arachidonic acid, suggesting that the neuronal differentiation is signalled through the phospholipase C gamma pathway. The sequential expression of FGF-2, followed by FGF within the developing forebrain neuroepithelium, fits with the different functions that the two FGFs play in precursor regulation. We have shown that the precursor response to FGF-1 is regulated by a heparan sulphate proteoglycan expressed within the developing neuroepithelium. Precursors restricted to the astrocyte cell lineage can be stimulated by epidermal growth factor or FGF-2F however, the differentiation into glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes appears to require a cytokine acting through the leukaemia inhibitory factor-beta receptor.","['Bartlett, P F', 'Richards, L R', 'Kilpatrick, T J', 'Talman, P T', 'Bailey, K A', 'Brooker, G J', 'Dutton, R', 'Koblar, S A', 'Nurcombe, V', 'Ford, M O']","['Bartlett PF', 'Richards LR', 'Kilpatrick TJ', 'Talman PT', 'Bailey KA', 'Brooker GJ', 'Dutton R', 'Koblar SA', 'Nurcombe V', 'Ford MO', 'et al.']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/embryology', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Prosencephalon/*cytology/embryology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470514795.ch5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1995;193:85-99; discussion 117-26. doi: 10.1002/9780470514795.ch5.,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,

One body of evidence specific to irradiation leukemogenesis documents the role of irradiated murine stromal cells in the cell biologic changes associated with evolution of leukemia in cocultivated, nonirradiated stem cells. Stem cell phenotypic changes that have been documented include upregulation of cell surface c-fms, downregulation of growth requirement for obligatory growth factors, and the appearance of novel transcripts detected by differential display. A second body of evidence documents the potential role of stromal cells functioning as biologic tumor promoters through their release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and production of altered adhesion molecules or growth factors during the chronic response to chemical or physical carcinogens. These molecular biologic mechanisms, potentially operative in stromal cells, can block apoptosis and induce DNA strand breaks in closely associated self-renewing stem cells. In an in vivo model of irradiation effects on lung stromal cells, we have irradiated the lungs of control C57BL/6J mice or other mice with orthotopic Lewis lung tumors and shown that TGF-beta release is increased following irradiation. The TGF-beta increase by irradiation may specifically be inhibited by administering an inhalation plasmid liposome mixture containing a transgene for human manganese superoxide dismutase prior to irradiation. An appreciation of the role of stromal cells in leukemogenesis and carcinogenesis may also be very relevant to the design of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of cancer, particularly since current strategies focus on eradication of stem cell transformants and do not rigorously address the persistence of surviving stromal cells.","['Greenberger, J S', 'Epperly, M W', 'Zeevi, A', 'Brunson, K W', 'Goltry, K L', 'Pogue-Geile, K L', 'Bray, J', 'Berry, L']","['Greenberger JS', 'Epperly MW', 'Zeevi A', 'Brunson KW', 'Goltry KL', 'Pogue-Geile KL', 'Bray J', 'Berry L']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1996 Jan-Feb;10(1):1-17.,,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to correlate the LIF concentrations in pleural effusions with the type of pathology and to compare its levels with those of IL-4, IL-8, IL-10 and M-CSF for a given pathology. Pleural fluids from 97 patients were assayed for cytokines by specific ELISAs. The concentrations of all cytokines tested were higher in infectious pleural effusions than in other pathologies (malignant or transudative). The lowest levels were observed for transudates. Significant differences were noted between pathology groups for each cytokine. A good correlation was observed between LIF and IL-8 for malignant effusions [regression correlation coefficient (RC) = 0.480, P < 0.01], between LIF and IL-4 for infectious disorders (RC = 0.543, P < 0.05) between LIF and IL-10 for transudates (RC = 0.798, P < 0.001) and between M-CSF and IL-8 in all pathologies tested except for primitive neoplasia (P < 0.05).

Of the 20 patients 14 were males and 6 females with a median age of 58 years (44-70). Eight had Binet stage B and 12 stage C. They were previously treated with chlorambucil, prednisone, mini-CHOP or irradiation. Their disease duration prior to fludarabine administration was 49 months (7-180).

In all CR patients a residual monoclonal CD5/CD19 positive lymphocyte population was found in the peripheral blood. All CRs relapsed shortly after discontinuation of therapy within 12 months. The main toxicity observed was upper respiratory tract and/or pulmonary infections in 8 patients, requiring hospitalization. Among the CRs one patient died during the administration of the third course of therapy, due to a severe hypersensitivity reaction with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The importance of maintenance therapy is also stressed as PR was sustained in some patients using 3 day cycles every 2-4 months. One patient was maintained in this fashion for 60 + months.

Hybrids displayed spontaneous high Ig secretion, which did not appear to be modified through stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC). Parental cells secreted minimal amounts of Ig spontaneously or through IFN-gamma and SAC stimulation, whereas PMA succeeded in increasing this secretion. An opposite pattern was observed when TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion an expression at the mRNA level were assessed in hybrids and parental cells. TNF-alpha and IL-6 were spontaneously secreted by parental cells and this secretion was increased after PMA and SAC stimulation, both cytokine secretion and expression at the mRNA level were negative in hybrid cells. The absence of expression of these cytokines could be explained either by chromosomal loss or by down regulation.

Significant amounts of other gangliosides were not found. The expression of GM2 on the MM cell lines, a cell type derived from outside of the nervous system, is unusual. This high level of expression was also seen in metabolic labeling studies. GM2 was readily detectable in the SKMM1 human multiple myeloma cell line by flow cytometry and served as a target for human complement-mediated cytotoxicity.

Although many questions regarding the optimal use of autotransplantation remain unanswered, the issue of the preferred timing at which to apply transplantation is of critical importance in planning therapeutic strategies for patients with this disease. This paper will focus on the timing options for autotransplantation in Hodgkin's disease. In the absence of a formal Phase III study comparing conventional salvage therapy versus autotransplantation in first relapse patients, the encouraging results from our center and others support the use of transplantation at the time of first relapse after combination chemotherapy. Non-relapse mortality is low in this setting, and the primary problem has been recurrent disease despite transplantation. Risk factors for both disease recurrence, as well as for the probability of progression-free survival, can be defined based on biologic features present at the time of first relapse after chemotherapy, and may provide a basis for improving the current transplant results for first relapse patients. Prolonged follow-up will be important to define the incidence and risk of late toxicities in autografted patients.","['Reece, D E', 'Phillips, G L']","['Reece DE', 'Phillips GL']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209067606 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Apr;21(3-4):245-53. doi: 10.3109/10428199209067606.,,,,,,55,,,,,,,,

CdA is phosphorylated intracellularly to its monophosphate derivative by the enzymes deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase. Cell lines deficient in deoxycytidine kinase were shown to be resistant to CdA and a high deoxycytidine kinase level in combination with low 5'-nucleotidase has been proposed to partly explain the selectivity in CdA toxicity for lymphoid cells. In this report biochemical properties in CdA phosphorylation mediated by deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase are reviewed and discussed in relation to the further metabolism of CdA 5'-monophosphate, the different possible mechanisms of action and the correlation with clinical response. It is concluded that much is known about the metabolism and mechanisms of action of CdA, but that the remarkable therapeutic effect in hairy cell leukemia has yet to be explicitly explained.","['Arner, E S']",['Arner ES'],"['Medical Nobel Institute for Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Cladribine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209067604 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Apr;21(3-4):225-31. doi: 10.3109/10428199209067604.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",,,,64,,,,,,,,

Cytofluorometric studies on fresh blast cells have demonstrated that CD11a, CD11b CD11c, CD15, CD45RO and CD54 expression is significantly lower in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) than is acute myeloid leukemia of other subtypes (AML). In vitro treatment with ATRA dramatically modifies the adhesion phenotype of APL blast cells, promoting a consistently striking up-regulation of CD11b, CD11c, CD15, CD65, CD54, and CD38. Which is in general, poorly demonstrable in AML. The behaviour of CD15s is variable and fully independent from CD15 and CD65 in induction experiments, suggesting a differential enzyme regulation within the selectin ligand system. ATRA is capable, in both APL and AML, of producing a switch from the high- (RA) to the low- (RO) molecular weight isoform of CD54, Moreover, treatment with this retinoid exerts a negative regulation of the membrane expression of CD49e, CD58 and CD11a in APL as well as in AML. Of particular interest is the fact that the negative effect on CD1 1a expression generates an asynchronous phenotype in APL (CD11a-, CD11b+, CD15+), undetectable on normal maturing myeloid cells. In the last part of this review the possible implications of adhesion molecule modulation in the pathogenesis of ATRA syndrome are discussed.","['Di Noto, R', 'Lo Pardo, C', 'Schiavone, E M', 'Ferrara, F', 'Manzo, C', 'Vacca, C', 'Del Vecchio, L']","['Di Noto R', 'Lo Pardo C', 'Schiavone EM', 'Ferrara F', 'Manzo C', 'Vacca C', 'Del Vecchio L']","['Divisione di Oncologia Sperimentale C, Ospedale A.

We report that amounts of a single multienzyme complex can vary on a per mitochondrion basis depending on the number of mitochondria per cell. Human branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) expression is used as a paradigm in these studies. Expression is compared and contrasted in HepG2 and DG75 cells in which mitochondrial content is twofold higher in the hepatocarcinoma line than in the lymphoblastoid line. Per cell, BCKD activity is equal in the two cells types, but BCKD protein concentration per mitochondrion is twofold higher in DG75 cells. Steady-state mRNA levels do not appear to be directly related to amounts of protein in the two cell lines. To test whether one subunit is limiting in formation of complex, overexpression of each BCKD subunit was elicited by plasmid transfection of the DG75 cells. Only overexpression of the beta-subunit of the decarboxylase component induced more BCKD activity without apparent increase in mRNA for the other endogenously expressed subunits. This implies that free BCKD subunits exist in a cell and can be recruited into an active complex when the limiting subunit becomes available.","['McConnell, B B', 'McKean, M C', 'Danner, D J']","['McConnell BB', 'McKean MC', 'Danner DJ']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['3-Methyl-2-Oxobutanoate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/enzymology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19960401)61:1<118::AID-JCB13>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19960401)61:1<118::aid-jcb13>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1996 Apr;61(1):118-26. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19960401)61:1<118::aid-jcb13>3.0.co;2-k.,,"['0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.2.4.4 (3-Methyl-2-Oxobutanoate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide))']",['DK 38320/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, CNTF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) reduced the apparent number of primary serotonergic neurons in E14 raphe culture by 90% as determined by immunocytochemistry for serotonin (5HT). The reduction in 5HT cell number was not due to neuronal loss as removal of CNTF after 4 days in culture resulted in a partial restitution of the serotonergic phenotype. In the RN46A serotonergic cell line which is induced to become serotonergic by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the addition of CNTF suppressed tryptophan hydroxylase and 5HT synthesis and increased choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) expression by 6-fold and ChAT activity by 20- to 30-fold over 12 days. As with the primary neurons, removal and replacement of CNTF with BDNF after 4 days resulted in a partial restitution of 5HT expression. Moreover, other members of the CNTF-cytokine family that use gp130 and/or LIF receptor beta as their signal transducing receptors-LIF, oncostatin M, interleukin 6, and interleukin 11-had similar effects on increasing ChAT activity and reducing 5HT expression in RN46A cells. Analysis of 5HT levels showed no significant difference in the amount of serotonin between wild-type and CNTFR alpha knockout mice at birth, suggesting that the potential to switch phenotype mediated through CNTFR alpha is a latent property of neuroepithelial precursors in the raphe nucleus.","['Rudge, J S', 'Eaton, M J', 'Mather, P', 'Lindsay, R M', 'Whittemore, S R']","['Rudge JS', 'Eaton MJ', 'Mather P', 'Lindsay RM', 'Whittemore SR']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In the current study, we have developed a model of hormone injection into the subcutaneous space overlying mouse parietal bones to demonstrate that similar processes occur in osteoblasts in vivo. Specifically, PTH and PTHrP rapidly and transiently induce expression of the mRNAs encoding IL-6 and LIF. The effects are dose-dependent, with a maximal stimulation of approximately 50-fold for each cytokine. Although PTH and PTHrP activate both adenyl cyclase and phospholipase C-dependent signal transduction pathways, stimulation of IL-6 and LIF depends on adenyl cyclase since it is not reproduced by PTH(3-34), a partial agonist that only activates phospholipase C. These results confirm our previous in vitro studies and support the hypothesis that IL-6 and/or LIF are physiologically important mediators of at least some of the actions of PTH and PTHrP.","['Pollock, J H', 'Blaha, M J', 'Lavish, S A', 'Stevenson, S', 'Greenfield, E M']","['Pollock JH', 'Blaha MJ', 'Lavish SA', 'Stevenson S', 'Greenfield EM']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,"['Actins/analysis/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Osteocalcin/analysis/drug effects', 'Parathyroid Hormone/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650110606 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1996 Jun;11(6):754-9. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650110606.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)']",['AR41674/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Cell lines stably expressing the mutant DNAs all released virion particles, and in all but one case infectious virus were generated. These viable mutants were all found to have reverted to the wild-type sequence. To generate fully mutant virus stocks, the mutant DNAs were introduced transiently into COS cells, which are resistant to infection with MuLV, thus prohibiting reversion by error-prone mechanisms involving reverse transcription. Virions harvested from the COS cells were confirmed as mutant by analyzing both virion proteins and the viral DNA they generated, and were then tested for infectivity in NIH/3T3 cells. The mutant viruses were infectious, but still rapidly gave rise to revertants. We conclude that the mutations within the cytoplasmic domain do not provide an absolute block to virus replication, but that the mutants replicate more slowly than the wild-type and quickly give rise to revertants with selective advantage for replication.","['Granowitz, C', 'Berkowitz, R D', 'Goff, S P']","['Granowitz C', 'Berkowitz RD', 'Goff SP']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA, Viral', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virion', '*Virus Replication']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168170295012788 [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(95)01278-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1996 Mar;41(1):25-42. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(95)01278-8.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cancer incidence on Pellworm was prospectively registered in the only general practice on the island from 1986 to 1992. Age-standardized rates and expected rates were calculated on the basis of the Saarland cancer registry, the only registry in Germany. Standardized incidence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Poisson-distributed events were also calculated. The cancer data were summed up over a seven-year period. SETTING: The only general practice on the island of Pellworm, a North Frisian marshland-island. SUBJECTS: The total practice population between 1986 and 1992 (N = 1172) RESULTS: The crude annual cancer incidence rate for Pellworm was, according to the impression, unexpectedly high: 634/100 000 for men and 502/100 000 for women. After age standardization, however, this increased rate of cancer incidence was even lower than in the Saarland (ratios: 0.86 for men and 0.95 for women). Only the incidence of neoplasms of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue in men exceeded the limits of statistical likelihood (ratio: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.17-7.10). CONCLUSION: The impression of an increased rate of cancer on Pellworm could not be validated. The overall incidence rate was even lower than expected. Only the rate of leukaemia/lymphoma (men) was significantly higher. Reasons for this result could not be detected by a descriptive approach. General practice is a suitable place for studies in cancer epidemiology, especially in such ideal circumstances as a clearly limited area and complete and reliable documentation.","['Kurzke, U', 'Himmel, W', 'Wegscheider, K', 'Abholz, H H', 'Kochen, M M']","['Kurzke U', 'Himmel W', 'Wegscheider K', 'Abholz HH', 'Kochen MM']","['Department of General Practice, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Scand J Prim Health Care,Scandinavian journal of primary health care,8510679,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Family Practice/statistics & numerical data', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Isolation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02813439608997066 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Prim Health Care. 1996 Mar;14(1):36-42. doi: 10.3109/02813439608997066.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell survival was estimated with trypan blue supravital stain following a 24 h incubation and has been followed in continuous cell cultures of 4 weeks duration.

A 99.9999% inhibition of Reh-6 and HL-60 was noted at irradiation doses where the corresponding mean survival of normal bone narrow cells was (33.6 +/- 15.5)% and (50.6 +/- 10.7)% respectively.

In the present study, the purine antagonist 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA, cladribine) and the pyrimidine antagonist 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine) were tested on four myeloma cell lines (i.e., U 266, OPM 2, RPMI 8226, IM 9), one plasma cell leukemia cell line (HS Sultan) and a myeloid control cell line (HL 60), all of which are resistant to 10-6 M dexamethasone. Gemcitabine has been found to be promising in the chemotherapy of other tumors with low proliferative activity, but its effectiveness against myeloma cells has not been analyzed so far. In our tests, gemcitabine induced a significant degree of apoptosis in all cell lines investigated. After incubation for 48 h with 10 microM gemcitabine, the median numbers of apoptotic cells were in the range of 45% in the OPM 2 and 79% in the U 266 cell line. All of the investigated cell lines were responsive to concentrations of 10 microM gemcitabine even after an exposure of only 30 min, three of them (U 266, HS Sultan, IM 9) also responded to a concentration of 10 nM. Higher concentrations and longer exposure times were necessary to suppress the growth of normal hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells. In contrast to gemcitabine, standard concentrations of 2-CdA (i.e., 30 and 300 nM) failed to induce a significant degree of apoptosis in the cell lines investigated but inhibited the growth of myeloid progenitor cells. The results suggest that gemcitabine induces apoptosis in myeloma and plasma cell leukemia lines resistant to steroids and 2-CdA. The fact that tumor cell apoptosis was achieved at concentrations clinically achievable and tolerable, which at the same time do not inhibit the growth of normal CFU-GM progenitor cells, favors the initiation of phase I trials with this drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Gruber, J', 'Geisen, F', 'Sgonc, R', 'Egle, A', 'Villunger, A', 'Boeck, G', 'Konwalinka, G', 'Greil, R']","['Gruber J', 'Geisen F', 'Sgonc R', 'Egle A', 'Villunger A', 'Boeck G', 'Konwalinka G', 'Greil R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biotin', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Steroids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140351 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 May;14(3):351-62. doi: 10.1002/stem.140351.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Steroids)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

M07e is a GM-CSF or interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent human leukemic cell line having surface markers characteristic of both myeloid progenitors and megakaryocytes. The effects of TPO on the proliferation and survival of M07e cells were investigated. Following an 18-h factor starvation period to remove residual growth factor signals and phase the cells in G0/G1, TPO provides a weak proliferative signal to M07e compared to IL-3 or GM-CSF treatment under the same conditions. However, TPO synergizes with both GM-CSF and IL-3, and to a greater extent with steel factor, a competence factor for M07e, in the induction of cellular proliferation. TPO sustains cellular integrity of M07e during prolonged (18 days) growth factor withdrawal and also protects M07e cells in serum-free conditions. In addition, preincubation of M07e for 72 h in TPO maintains its survival for subsequent cytokine-induced proliferation, while control media do not. TPO suppresses growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis as evaluated by flow cytometric detection of both in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling and cellular DNA content via propidium iodide staining. These results suggest a role for TPO as a survival factor for M07e cells.","['Ritchie, A', 'Vadhan-Raj, S', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Ritchie A', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biotin', 'Blood Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140330 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 May;14(3):330-6. doi: 10.1002/stem.140330.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']","['R01 HL-49202/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that HOXA and HOXB genes are expressed in human CD34+ cells, and are downregulated as cells leave the CD34+ compartment. In addition, expression of certain genes, including HOXB3 and HOXB4, is largely restricted to the long-term culture-initiating cell enriched pool, containing the putative stem cell population. Studies have also shown that HOX genes appear to be important for normal T lymphocyte and activated natural killer cell function. Overexpression of Hox-b4 in transplanted murine marrow cell results in a dramatic expansion of stem cells, while maintaining normal peripheral blood counts. In contrast, overexpression of Hox-a10 resulted in expansion of progenitor pools, accompanied by unique changes in the differentiation patterns of committed progenitors. Overexpression of Hox-a10 or Hox-b8 led to the development of myeloid leukemias, while animals transfected with marrow cells overexpressing Hox-b4 do not appear to develop malignancies. Blockade of HOX gene function using antisense oligonucleotides has revealed that several HOX genes appear to influence either myeloid or erythroid colony formation. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the HOX-a9 gene show reduced numbers of granulocytes and lymphocytes, smaller spleens and thymuses, and reduced numbers of committed progenitors. These studies demonstrate that HOX homeobox genes play a role in both the early stem cell function as well as in later stages of hematopoietic differentiation, and that perturbations of HOX gene expression can be leukemogenic.","['Lawrence, H J', 'Sauvageau, G', 'Humphries, R K', 'Largman, C']","['Lawrence HJ', 'Sauvageau G', 'Humphries RK', 'Largman C']","['Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140281 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 May;14(3):281-91. doi: 10.1002/stem.140281.,,,,,,99,,,,,,,,

The PCR studies to date suggest that this sensitive technique can detect residual disease in virtually all patients during the first year of treatment. The residual disease becomes undetectable in the majority of patients by the end of treatment; however, a subset of patients remain PCR positive at a time when therapy is electively discontinued. The development of a highly accurate quantitative PCR technique may allow the possibility of distinguishing the patterns of residual disease for patients who will be cured by treatment from those who relapse. If such a pattern can be discerned, then an immediate benefit for PCR monitoring will be that clinicians will have the opportunity to test whether treating patients at the time of 'molecular relapse' will help to improve the cure rate for this disease. The PCR studies of remission marrows at the end of treatment raise a number of questions about the biology of disease persistence in patients who remain in extended 'remission.' A commitment to obtaining and analyzing bone marrow specimens in patients who have completed therapy is necessary to discern whether novel strategies, such as immunomodulatory manipulations, are needed to control or eradicated residual disease in patients who have completed planned chemotherapy. Thus, the long-term benefit of residual disease monitoring by PCR may be a better understanding of the biology and definition of 'cure' in ALL.","['Roberts, W M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kitchingman, G R', 'Zipf, T F']","['Roberts WM', 'Estrov Z', 'Kitchingman GR', 'Zipf TF']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Division of Pediatrics, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4613-1261-1_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 1996;84:149-66. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-1261-1_8.,,,,,,56,,,,,,,,

We used this combination plus novantrone (FLANG regimen) in a case of Ph1+ chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) unresponsive to interferon alpha that had progressed to an acute phase, after 3 months of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and hydroxyurea. The patient was treated with two courses of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 (days 1-5) + Ara-C 2 g/m2 (days 1-5) + novantrone 5 mg/m2 (days 1-3) and G-CSF from day 0 to neutrophil recovery. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, bone marrow blasts decreased from 100% to less than 5% (clinical complete remission), with a progressive clearance of Ph1+ metaphases (from 100% to 12%). At the end of the second course, a progressive increase of blasts was observed again and karyotypic detection of Ph+ cells was also documented (from 12% to 42.9%). During this partial remission, the patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA matched identical brother. At the time of this report, he is still alive and well and in complete karyotypic remission.

The CD11c expression only decreased by exposure to GM-CSF and IL-4. The cells also showed a decrease in alpha-naphthylesterase (alpha-NAE) activity and an increase in peroxidase (Px) activity in the GM-CSF supplemented cultures. Remarkable changes in cell morphology were also observed. IL-4 induced morphologic features resembling histiocytic-like cells positive for the expression of alpha-NAE and negative for Px. GM-CSF induced cells with pseudopods, negative for alpha-NAE expression and positive for Px. TPA effect on U-937 cells was similar to that observed with GM-CSF. No proliferative response was detected with any of the factors assayed.

Typical isoenzyme patterns designated Mono 1/Mono 2 (for monocyte-associated), My 1/My 2 (for myeloid or myeloma), Lym 1/Lym 2 (for lymphoid) and Und (for undifferentiated) could be reproducibly discerned. The Mono patterns contained one unique isoenzyme encoded by the monocyte-specific esterase gene. This comparative analysis of 255 leukemia-lymphoma cell lines covered the major cell lineage that are affected by hematological neoplasias. The results showed that (except for myelomas) lymphoid-derived malignancies, both leukemias and lymphomas, expressed primarily the Und and Lym esterase isoenzyme profiles. In contrast, myeloid leukemia cells and the related erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines displayed mainly the My patterns. The Mono patterns were detected predominantly in monocyte-derived leukemias. As the B-lymphocytic hierarchy progresses from pre B-cells via B-cells to plasma cells, number and intensity of the isoenzymes increased as well from the Und pattern to the My isoenzyme profile. Hodgkin's disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma lines displayed heterogenous isoenzyme profiles consistent with their heterogenous cellular origin. The present study using continuous leukemia-lymphoma cell lines as model systems provides a biochemical characterization of different hematopoietic cell lineages and stages of differentiation.","['Gignac, S M', 'Hu, Z B', 'Denkmann, S A', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Gignac SM', 'Hu ZB', 'Denkmann SA', 'Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Esterases/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia/classification/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*enzymology/pathology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051742 [doi]'],ppublish,"Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jun;22(1-2):143-51,follow. 186, color plate XII. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051742.",,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the French-American-British (FAB) and standard histologic classification, the cases corresponded to small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL, group I; n = 22, consisting of CLL, n = 10, CLL/PL, n = 3, and CLLmixed, n = 7); intermediate differentiated lymphoma/mantle cell lymphoma (IDL/MCL, group II, n = 18); and others with CD5-positive lymphomas (group III, n = 18). The CD5+ B-cell lymphomas showed morphologic and prognostic variability among the three groups. The clinical and immunophenotypic features were remarkably consistent in leukemic disease being seen in 73% of all cases, splenomegaly in 63%, and intense CD19, CD20, surface membrane immunogobulin M (SmIgM) or SmIgM and SmIgD, light-chain expression, and no CD10 expression. The median survival time of groups I, II, and III was 7.8, 3.3, and 0.8 years, respectively. These findings suggest that CD5 antigens may serve as valid markers for the prognosis and clinical features of B-cell lymphomas and that CD5+ B-cell lymphomas with an overall poor prognosis occurs at a relatively high frequency in Japan. This also suggests that a combination of immunophenotypic and morphologic features is of value for characterizing CD5+ B-cell neoplasms.","['Kamihira, S', 'Hirakata, Y', 'Atogami, S', 'Sohda, H', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Kamihira S', 'Hirakata Y', 'Atogami S', 'Sohda H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blood Cell Count', 'CD5 Antigens/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051741 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jun;22(1-2):137-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051741.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have evaluated whether apoptosis occurs in AML cells of patients treated by HDMP using morphological criteria. For light and electron microscopic examination bone marrow aspirates were obtained four days and two weeks after methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) treatment from two children with newly diagnosed AML (AML-M3 and AML-M4). In both patients maturation of leukemic cells has previously been reported four days (in patient with AML-M3) and two weeks (in patient with AML-M4) after HDMP treatment. Electron microscopy revealed the characteristic ultrastructural changes of various stages of apoptosis four days after HDMP treatment in a case with AML-M3. Morphologic evidence of apoptosis induced by HDMP were also detected on Wright-stained and toluidine blue stained semithin sections of BM preparations in a patient with AML-M4 and AML-M3 respectively. These findings suggest that HDMP which could induce in vivo terminal differentiation in myeloid leukemic cells is also able to induce apoptosis in patients with AML.

The malignant clone produces TNF, and addition of exogenous TNF up-regulates the TNF mRNA in B-CLL cells. Interleukin-6 (rIL-6) may also be important in this growth loop. We studied the interaction of TNF and IL-6 in the regulation of DNA synthesis (3H-TdR uptake), cytokine release and cell survival in CLL cells in vitro. Addition of TNF (100 U/ml over 5 days) enhanced DNA synthesis from 718 +/- 284 (mean cpm +/- SE) to 2730 +/- 545 compared to cells cultured in medium alone (n = 16, p < 0.01). TNF-alpha induced DNA synthesis was inhibited in all cases studied by the addition of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (5 micrograms/ml) to cell cultures. Spontaneous IL-6 protein release was enhanced in the presence of TNF (100 U/ml and 250 U/ml) by CLL cells at 48 hours of culture 143.6% and 172% (p < 0.05, n = 6). At 120 hours of culture, the increase was 323% and 412.5% (4 of 7 cases) of the control respectively. IL-6 (100 U/ml or greater) increased spontaneous DNA synthesis (3H-TdR uptake) but, in the presence of high concentrations of TNF-alpha, inhibited TNF induced DNA synthesis in a dose dependent manner. Cell survival was reduced in the presence of anti-IL-6 mAb, while IL-6 was able to protect CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis. These results suggest that IL-6 in an autocrine manner may inhibit DNA synthesis but prolongs survival in CLL cells. Increased serum IL-6 levels were detected in 27 of 50 cases of CLL, the mean level being significantly higher in Rai Stage III and IV cases compared to Rai Stage O-II cases.","['Reittie, J E', 'Yong, K L', 'Panayiotidis, P', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Reittie JE', 'Yong KL', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Hoffbrand AV']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, England, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051732 [doi]'],ppublish,"Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jun;22(1-2):83-90, follow. 186, color plate VI. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051732.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, patients with primary immuno-deficiencies, or those suffering from diseases characterized by autoimmune dysfunction, show an increased risk for the development of NHL. Several viruses have been identified as possible etiologic agents for NHL; one of the best studied is the Epstein-Barr virus, which was detected in cultures of tumor cells from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. The pathogenetic potential of this virus is illustrated by its association with an increasing number of malignant diseases. In addition, the human T-cell lymphotropic virus family (HTLV), was also recognized as possible etiologic agents for several lymphomas, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and T-cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome (HTLV-I), and T-cell hairy cell leukemia (HTLV-II). Recently, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection has also been recognized in several hematological malignancies such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, low-grade malignant lymphomas and Waldenstrom's disease.

The administration of colony-stimulating factor(s) (CSFs) to patients with MDS increased blood neutrophil concentrations, in most patients, and was also expected to be beneficial and to prevent infections. However, the progression to AML during the treatment with CSFs was suspected in some patients. Therefore, extensive in vitro studies were expected to lead to the establishment of criteria for selection of patients who are likely to benefit from CSF's as well as to establish the overall value of the different types of CSFs therapy. For this purpose, in vitro colony assays provide an excellent tool for investigating the biologic characteristics of MDS progenitor cells. However, conditions of the culture must be such that each progenitor can express its full potential for proliferation and differentiation. Because of the above, MDS progenitor cells cannot be used because they carry an impairment in proliferation and differentiation. To address this problem, one needs to know how many cells are being handled and the maximum numbers of colonies and clusters expected. CD34, a stem cell phenotype, is at present one of the best markers of progenitor cells, and can be used for purposes of purification. Using a defined number of CD34+ cells, it was feasible to make direct investigations on MDS progenitor cells. In this review the properties of MDS progenitor cells are described, in association with proliferation and differentiation, with special emphasis on the phenotypic subpopulations of MDS CD34+ cells.","['Sawada, K']",['Sawada K'],"['Department of Internal Medicine II, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology/therapy', 'Neutropenia/etiology/therapy']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051727 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jun;22(1-2):43-51. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051727.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",,,,127,,,,,,,,

A feedback regulatory loop involving pRb, p16ink4a, and CDKs seems to regulate G1/S phases transition. p16ink4a and p15ink4b are deleted in high frequency in human cell lines and in some fresh solid tumors. Point mutations of p16ink4a have also been sequenced, especially in familial melanomas and digestive cancers but preferential mechanism of p16ink4a/p15ink4b inactivation seems to be biallelic deletion. In hematological malignancies, homozygous deletions of p16ink4a and p15ink4b occur frequently in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (14-40%), lymphoid type blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and adult T cell leukemia (ATL), but p16ink4a deletions are more frequent than p15ink4b deletions, and hemizygous deletions of either p16ink4a and p15ink4b are rare.

In vitro studies with cells from a spectrum of CLL patients demonstrate that loxoribine induces B-CLL cells to enter and traverse the cell cycle. This is reflected by marked increases in DNA synthesis, by standard morphological criteria, and by flow cytometric evaluation of cell cycle status and of cell surface activation markers. Cells from about 75% of patients studied evince this response. Analysis of a variety of biological parameters indicate that only the ratio of T cells (CD4+ or CD8+) to B-CLL cells correlates with induction and degree of proliferative response. Co-stimulation with loxoribine and IL-2 results in modest proliferative synergy, presumably due to upregulation of IL-2R alpha expression on B-CLL cells by loxoribine. Prolonged exposure of B-CLL cells to stimulatory concentrations of loxoribine frequently culminates in progression of the responsive cells to apoptosis. The capacity of loxoribine to transiently approximate the reversible transformation of a low grade B cell malignancy to one of a higher grade presents the opportunity for evaluation of cycle-active drugs under these conditions. Recent studies indicate that pre-treatment of B-CLL cells with loxoribine results in synergistic killing of leukemic cells with cycle-active drugs. The ability to induce B-CLL cells into cell cycle entry and/or into either activation-induced apoptosis or into phases of the cell cycle sensitive to cytotoxic therapy opens up new perspectives for the development of potentially curative strategies for this chronic leukemia.","['Goodman, M G', 'Spinosa, J C', 'Saven, A', 'Piro, L D', 'Wormsley, S']","['Goodman MG', 'Spinosa JC', 'Saven A', 'Piro LD', 'Wormsley S']","['Scripps Research Institute, Department of Immunology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Count/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051723 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jun;22(1-2):1-10. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051723.,,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '9CAS0V66OI (loxoribine)']",,,,51,,,,,,,,

The failure of peptide N-glycosidase F to completely remove alpha 2, 8-polysialic acid bearing oligosaccharides from the RBL protein, and the sensitivity of these oligosaccharides to beta-elimination, suggests that alpha 2, 8-polysialic acid may be found on O-linked oligosaccharides.

Other issues of interest include CB volume reduction, hematopoietic progenitor purification, ex vivo expansion prior to transplantation, and experimental protocols for gene transfer, such as those related to the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene.","['Lazzari, L', 'Corsini, C', 'Curioni, C', 'Lecchi, L', 'Scalamogna, M', 'Rebulla, P', 'Sirchia, G']","['Lazzari L', 'Corsini C', 'Curioni C', 'Lecchi L', 'Scalamogna M', 'Rebulla P', 'Sirchia G']","['Centro Trasfusionale e di Immunologia dei Trapianti, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Blood Banks/*organization & administration/standards', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Preservation/methods', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cryopreservation/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Fetal Blood', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/standards', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'North America', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.117 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1996 Apr;5(2):117-22. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.117.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutropenic patients were given piperacillin combined with amikacin, and teicoplanin was added to the regimen the day fever developed in patients suspected of having a staphylococcal infection or 48 h later. Teicoplanin was given intravenously at a dosage of 6 mg/kg of body weight at 0, 12, and 24 h and once a day thereafter. Five to eleven blood samples per patient were collected. Teicoplanin concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography. A bicompartmental model was fitted to the data by a nonlinear mixed-effect-model approach. Multiple-linear regression analysis was applied in an attempt to correlate PK parameters to nine covariates. The mean trough concentrations of teicoplanin 48 h after the onset of treatment and 24 h after the last injection (last trough) +/- standard deviations were 8.8 +/- 4.1 and 17.5 +/- 13.5 mg/liter, respectively. A significant increase was noted in the mean rate of elimination clearance of teicoplanin in neutropenic patients compared with that of HV (0.86 versus 0.73 liter/h, P = 0.002), as was the case with rates of distribution clearance (5.89 versus 4.94 liter/h, P = 0.002); the mean half-life of distribution was significantly shorter in patients than in HV (0.43 versus 0.61 h, P = 0.002). In contrast, the volumes of the central compartment (ca. 5.8 liters for both groups), the volumes of distribution at steady state (HV, 37.6 liters; patients, 55.9 liters), and the elimination half-lives (HV, 39.6 h; patients, 52.7 h) were not significantly different between HV and neutropenic patients. Interindividual variabilities of rates of clearance (coefficient of variation [CV], 43%) and elimination half-lives (CV, 56%) were mainly explained by the variabilities among rates of creatinine clearance. Interindividual variabilities of the volumes of the central compartment (CV, 33%) and the volumes of distribution at steady state (CV = 51%) were correlated to interindividual variabilities among numbers of leukocytes and the ages of patients, respectively. On the basis of the population PK model of teicoplanin, simulations were made to optimize the dosing schedule. A supplemental 6 mg/kg dose of teicoplanin at 36 h resulted in a trough concentration at 48 h of 16.0 +/- 4.5 mg/liter, with only 7% of patients having a trough concentration of less than 10 mg/liter, compared with 46% of patients on the usual schedule.","['Lortholary, O', 'Tod, M', 'Rizzo, N', 'Padoin, C', 'Biard, O', 'Casassus, P', 'Guillevin, L', 'Petitjean, O']","['Lortholary O', 'Tod M', 'Rizzo N', 'Padoin C', 'Biard O', 'Casassus P', 'Guillevin L', 'Petitjean O']","['Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital Avicenne, Universite Paris-Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amikacin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperacillin/pharmacokinetics', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy', 'Teicoplanin/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.40.5.1242 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1996 May;40(5):1242-7. doi: 10.1128/AAC.40.5.1242.,PMC163299,"['61036-62-2 (Teicoplanin)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal adult mice, polyreactive IgM secreting lymphocytes constituted 8-9% of the actively expressed repertoire. Under conditions of generalized immune activation, this frequency increased to 13-19% (p. < .01). Polyreactive IgG secreting B cells, which were present at frequencies of < 0.5% in normal adult mice, were found at freqeuncies of 6-10% in mice with autoimmune disease, chronic virus infection or following mitogen treatment (p. < .001).

Previous studies have shown that PCR positivity is common following BMT. However, the clinical significance of this finding for any given individual who is PCR positive remains unclear, as many of these patients remain long-term disease-free survivors after allogeneic BMT. In the present study, we used PCR to detect BCR-ABL mRNA in 144 blood or marrow samples from 36 patients who received a T cell-depleted BMT for CML in first chronic phase. Six patients had no evidence of PCR-detectable residual disease at any time following transplant. The other 30 patients had at least one positive PCR result post-BMT. Once PCR positivity was found, it was usually sustained, with only four patients having a subsequent PCR negative assay. No patient who had two consecutive PCR-positive assays had a return to PCR negativity. None of the six patients with exclusively PCR-negative assays have developed either cytogenetic or hematologic relapse at a median follow-up of 42 months. Of the 30 patients with at least one PCR-positive assay post-BMT, 28 were PCR positive at last follow-up, and 22 have progressed to cytogenetic or hematologic relapse. If the PCR-positive assay occurred within 24 months of the transplant then the estimated probability of progression to cytogenetic or hematologic relapse was 65% at 24 months. Twenty of the 26 patients who were studied early (< or = 6 months) after BMT had at least one positive PCR assay. Fifteen of the 20 patients who were PCR positive < or = 6 months following transplant have progressed to either cytogenetic or hematologic relapse resulting in an estimated probability of relapse of 84% at 24 months. These results indicate that following T cell-depleted BMT for CML in first chronic phase, PCR is highly predictive of relapse and may identify a cohort of patients in need of therapeutic intervention before the onset of overt clinical relapse.","['Mackinnon, S', 'Barnett, L', 'Heller, G']","['Mackinnon S', 'Barnett L', 'Heller G']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Life Tables', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Apr;17(4):643-7.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven of 311 patients examined had CNS disease at presentation, but none had active CNS disease at the time of BMT. Lumbar punctures were performed in 93 patients 1-2229 days (median 98) after BMT because of suspected CNS infection, hemorrhage or relapse (n = 65), or after systemic relapse (n = 28).

In this study, the clinical and serologic responses to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in children after BMT was assessed. Twenty-two BMT recipients were vaccinated with MMR II (MSD). All were at least 2 years post-BMT and without GVHD. Their underlying conditions were leukemia (11), aplastic or Fanconi's anemia (7), thalassemia (3) and metabolic disease (1). All were allogeneic transplants with matched related donors. The mean age at transplantation was 6.9 years. There were no reported adverse effects of the vaccination. Antibody status for MMR was determined using commercial assays (IFA and ELISA) on paired specimens. The mean interval between transplantation and vaccination was 48 months. Pre-vaccination, no BMT recipient was sero-positive for all three, but 23% were positive for measles, 31% for mumps and 14% for rubella. Post-vaccination, 68% of BMT recipients were sero-positive for all three, with 77% for measles, 87% for mumps and 91% for rubella. Therefore, MMR vaccination at 2 years or later after BMT in paediatric recipients without GVHD was safe and significantly increased the proportion sero-positive for MMR.","['King, S M', 'Saunders, E F', 'Petric, M', 'Gold, R']","['King SM', 'Saunders EF', 'Petric M', 'Gold R']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Sick Children, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contraindications', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Measles Vaccine/*immunology', 'Measles virus/immunology', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Mumps Vaccine/*immunology', 'Mumps virus/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rubella Vaccine/*immunology', 'Rubella virus/immunology', 'Safety', 'Time Factors', '*Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Combined/*immunology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Apr;17(4):633-6.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Measles Vaccine)', '0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Mumps Vaccine)', '0 (Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Combined)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, it has also been shown that combining Epo with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and with myelodysplastic syndromes resulted in additive effects on erythropoiesis. To test the effects of combined G-CSF + Epo therapy on erythroid recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation a pilot randomized, three-arm trial was designed. Thirty patients suffering from lymphoid malignancies submitted to ABMT were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF alone (5 micrograms/kg, from day + 1 up to reaching an ANC > or = 10(9)/1), G-CSF + Epo (150 U/kg, from day +1 to +21), or neither of these (controls). Patients receiving G-CSF + Epo had significantly more reticulocytes on day +21 and reached 30 x 10(9)/1 reticulocytes earlier when compared to both G-CSF and control patients; however, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions was not modified by the addition of Epo to G-CSF, although both groups had significantly fewer units transfused than controls. No effect on platelet recovery or platelet transfusional requirements was observed. Myeloid recovery was comparable in the G-CSF and G-CSF+Epo groups, and significantly accelerated as compared to controls. We conclude that the addition of Epo to G-CSF causes a slight acceleration of erythroid recovery after ABMT, but is not associated with transfusional benefits. Therefore, the present data do not support the use of Epo in association with G-CSF to hasten erythroid recovery after ABMT.","['Vannucchi, A M', 'Bosi, A', 'Ieri, A', 'Guidi, S', 'Saccardi, R', 'Lombardini, L', 'Linari, S', 'Laszlo, D', 'Longo, G', 'Rossi-Ferrini, P']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Bosi A', 'Ieri A', 'Guidi S', 'Saccardi R', 'Lombardini L', 'Linari S', 'Laszlo D', 'Longo G', 'Rossi-Ferrini P']","['BMT Unit, University of Florence, Careggi Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Anemia/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Blood Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Reticulocyte Count/drug effects', 'Safety', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Apr;17(4):527-31.,,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to decrease the variability of BU steady-state concentration (Css) following oral dosing, a BU dose escalation study based on targeted plasma levels was performed in patients receiving autologous transplants for AML or syngeneic transplants for CML. In this study, the BU dose was adjusted up or down based on observed plasma concentration. All patients received a fixed dose of CY 60 mg/kg and TBI of 12 Gy. The first dose level evaluated was 8.6 mg/kg with a target BU Css of 511 ng/ml. Eight patients were entered at this level and the median BU Css achieved was 441 (range 253-566). One of eight patients developed grade 3-4 regimen-related toxicities (RRT). The oral dose of BU for dose level II was 10.6 mg/kg with a target Css of 632 ng/ml. Six patients were entered at this level and median BU Css achieved was 642 (range 566-674). One of six patients developed grade 3-4 RRT. The oral dose for dose level III was 12.6 mg/kg with a target BU Css of 754 ng/ml. Five patients with AML were entered at this dose level and the median plasma BU Css was 733 ng/ml (682-900). Two of five (40%) patients at dose level III developed grade 3-4 RRT which was considered excessive making dose level II the MTD. This study showed that targeted BU Css can reliably be achieved with a bias of -5.23% and mean absolute error of 11.3%. Overall, targeting made a -32.5% to 158.3% change in plasma BU Css as compared to expected BU Css based on first dose pharmacokinetics if targeting were not performed in this study. Thus, targeting avoided much of the variability in BU Css seen in other studies and appears to have allowed for an increase in oral dosing from 8 mg/kg to 10.6 mg/kg. Despite achieving higher and more uniform BU Css, there was no apparent effect on relapse or survival, although the number of patients evaluated was small.","['Demirer, T', 'Buckner, C D', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Sanders, J', 'Lambert, K', 'Clift, R', 'Fefer, A', 'Storb, R', 'Slattery, J T']","['Demirer T', 'Buckner CD', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Bensinger WI', 'Sanders J', 'Lambert K', 'Clift R', 'Fefer A', 'Storb R', 'Slattery JT']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', '*Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Apr;17(4):491-5.,,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']","['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Even with HLA identity by microlymphocytotoxicity assay and non-reactive MLC, URD marrow transplant recipients have a higher incidence of graft rejection and GVHD. The preparative regimen busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg (BuCy2) has been shown to be at least as effective in preparation of recipients with CML of HLA-identical sibling grafts as cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Cy/TBI). However, concern about a high rejection rate in URD transplants has prevented most centers from using BuCy2 in this setting. From March 1990 to March 1994, 26 patients underwent URD transplantation following preparation with BuCy2. Patients received either standard cyclosporine and methotrexate or cyclosporine and methylprednisolone for GVHD prophylaxis.

In particular, long term effects on healthy donors by the mobilization procedure which includes the exposition to G-CSF over several days are unknown. Recently the possibility of an increase in risk for acute leukaemia in this cohort has been discussed. Systematic long-term safety monitoring for AlloPBPCT donors cannot be adequately planned without agreeing on a both relevant and reasonably pessimistic hypothetical size of the increased leukaemia risk to be detected if present. Using data on leukaemia after treatment for Hodgkin's disease as example it is argued that a) excess leukaemia cases should be expected to occur predominantly between 2 and 10 years after the leukaemogenic event and b) a reasonably pessimistic guess would expect about 0.5% leukaemia cases at 10 years in AlloPBPCT donors. Such a tenfold increase over the general population's 10 year leukaemia incidence would be relevant, but require long-term follow up of several thousands of donors to demonstrate or exclude.

In the MCSA system, antibody-induced Ab1' responses were effective in protecting mice from tumor development upon subsequent challenge with live virus. Furthermore, antigen-independent modulation of immunity to both viral and nonviral antigens was found to be thymus-dependent.

Two families of RA receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), have been identified. The therapeutic effect of all-trans-RA (ATRA) in induction of remission for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has largely been proved, and this has, over the past 10 years, greatly stimulated research on oncogenesis and RA-regulated differentiation pathways. In APL, one of the RAR genes, RARA, is fused to PML in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(15; 17). However, a small subset of APL patients have a different fusion gene, PLZF-RARA, resulting from the variant translocation t(11;17). A third translocation, t(5;17), in which the NPM gene is fused to RARA, has been described. Current data suggest that PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha fusion receptors may play an important role in the development of APL and that PML-RAR alpha could be the target of ATRA differentiation therapy. Characterization of the genes regulated by retinoic acid may open up new prospects for an understanding of the mechanisms of ATRA differentiation therapy for APL and may help to extend the concept of cancer-targeting treatment to other types of leukemias or solid tumors.","['Chen, Z', 'Tong, J H', 'Dong, S', 'Zhu, J', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, S J']","['Chen Z', 'Tong JH', 'Dong S', 'Zhu J', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Peoples Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*physiopathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/physiology', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199603)15:3<147::AID-GCC1>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199603)15:3<147::AID-GCC1>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996 Mar;15(3):147-56. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199603)15:3<147::AID-GCC1>3.0.CO;2-2.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,123,,['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Feb;18(2):151-3.

Dipyridamole inhibited the enhanced efflux of epirubicin in doxorubicin-resistant cells. However, dipyridamole had no effect on both the influx and efflux of epirubicin in doxorubicin-sensitive cells. In mice, lethal and bone marrow toxicity induced by epirubicin were potentiated by administration of high-dose of dipyridamole. In addition, in vivo results also demonstrated that dipyridamole in combination with epirubicin produced a significant reversal of the in vivo antitumor activity of epirubicin in mice bearing P388/DOX cells.

The optimal technique still needs to be defined. Selection of CD34+ cells in transplant material may be of benefit in allogeneic and autologous peripheral blood precursor cell transplantation (PBPCT), since it allows elimination of unwanted CD34-negative cells, such as T-cells and contaminating tumor cells. We have evaluated the feasibility of CD34 selection in PB transplants and studied hemopoietic reconstitution after autologous transplantation of CD34 selected precursor cells. Between August 1994 and June 1995 CD34 selection was performed on 12 transplants for 9 patients with malignant disease (non-Hodgkin lymphoma [n = 5]; Ewing sarcoma [n = 1]; chronic lymphocytic leukemia [n = 1]; breast cancer [n = 1]; multiple myeloma [n = 1]). PBPC were collected with a Fenwall CS 3000 harvester after stimulation with G-CSF. For selection of CD34+ cells the Ceprate LC34 system (CellPro) was used. A median CD34 purity of 73% (range 40-94%) was achieved. The median number of CD34 positive cells per transplant was 4.8 x 10(6)/kg body weight (range 0.7-15.8). The median number of colony forming cells per transplant was 31 x 10(4)/kg body weight (range 1.5-131.3). For autologous PBPCT the minimal number of CD34 positive cells required in the transplantate was arbitrarily set at 1.0 x 10(6)/kg body weight. This number was achieved in 10 of the 12 transplants. The median loss of CD34+ cells during selection was 1.5 x 10(6)/kg body weight (range 0.2-6.4). In 2 patients the total number was reduced to below the critical value of 1.0 x 10(6)/kg. 7 of the 9 patients received the CD34 selected transplant after intensive chemotherapy and irradiation. The median follow-up time after PBPCT was 196 days (range 62-278). All 7 patients are now alive and with normal hemopoietic function. A granulocyte count above 0.5 x 10(9)/l and a platelet count above 20 x 10(9)/l was achieved on day 14 (median), and on day 19 after PBPCT. We conclude that CD34 selection is technically feasible and that CD34 selected cells can be used for PBPCT. The procedure is time consuming and expensive; it requires complex organization at laboratory level, and the benefit of CD34 selection with regard to T-cell depletion and tumor purging still needs to be proven. However, CD34+ selection is likely to open new perspectives in transplantation medicine.","['Tichelli, A', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Bargetzi, M', 'Nissen, C', 'Wernli, M', 'Herrmann, R', 'Orth, B', 'Signer, E', 'Speck, B']","['Tichelli A', 'Gratwohl A', 'Bargetzi M', 'Nissen C', 'Wernli M', 'Herrmann R', 'Orth B', 'Signer E', 'Speck B']","['Departement Zentrallaboratorium, Universittsspital, Basel.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*isolation & purification', 'Blood Component Removal/methods', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/02/10 00:00,1996/02/10 00:01,['1996/02/10 00:00'],"['1996/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1996 Feb 10;126(6):201-6.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,Autologe Transplantation von hmopoietischen Vorlauferzellen nach CD34-Anreicherung.,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), interferon alpha 2b (IFN alpha 2b), interleukin 2 (IL-2) or their combinations to induce cytotoxicity. This stimulation significantly increased the percentage of cells expressing p53, which was at its maximum when induced by IL-2 combined with IFN alpha 2b. The role of p53 in the modulation of different aspects of cytotoxic activity of these cells was analyzed by studying the effects of p53 abrogation by antisense oligonucleotide (p53 AS) treatment in comparison with p53 sense or scrambled (missense) oligonucleotide (p53 S or p53 MS) treatment. We show that p53 plays a key role through induction of apoptosis in target cells (tumor necrosis factor pathway) rather than through osmolytic degeneration (perforin pathway) which is only slightly increased by p53 abrogation. Meanwhile, in vitro abrogation of p53 expression in PBL was found to be accompanied by an increase of CD8+ lymphocytes and an important increase of the CD56 'bright' NK cell sub-population.","['Mahdi, T', 'Tanzer, J', 'Brizard, A', 'Guilhot, F', 'Babin, P', 'Kitzis, A']","['Mahdi T', 'Tanzer J', 'Brizard A', 'Guilhot F', 'Babin P', 'Kitzis A']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, CHU de Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thionucleotides', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0248490096894275 [pii]', '10.1016/0248-4900(96)89427-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 1995;84(3):175-85. doi: 10.1016/0248-4900(96)89427-5.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Four of six patients showed toxicity after AmB and AmB/lipid infusions; only one patient reacted to liposomal AmB. Clinical toxicity was associated with increases in TNF-alpha plasma levels during two of four infusions of AmB and three of four infusions of AmB/lipid. Major increases in IL-6 occurred during three of four infusions of AmB and during all four AmB/lipid infusions associated with clinical toxicity. Three of four AmB infusions and all four AmB/lipid infusions accompanied by clinical toxicity were associated with major increases in IL-1-RA plasma concentrations. Liposomal AmB was better tolerated than AmB and AmB/lipid. This formulation also caused the lowest liberation of all three cytokines tested. The severity of clinical symptoms did not correlate closely with absolute cytokine plasma levels.

Chickens of line 15I5 x 7(1) susceptible to ALV-induced lymphoma were inoculated at hatch with Rous-associated virus-1 (RAV-1) or strain RPL-40 of subgroup A ALV. All chickens, except for negative controls, were also inoculated at hatch with strain 301B/1 of serotype 2 MDV or strain FC126 of turkey herpesvirus (HVT), a serotype 3 MDV. At 11 and 14 weeks of age, serial sections of bursal tissues from chickens in various treatment groups were stained with methyl green pyronin and examined for ALV-induced pre-neoplastic bursal lesions, also known as hyperplastic follicles. At 6 days and at 11 and 14 weeks of age, bursal tissues from groups of chickens inoculated with serotype 2 MDV and ALV at hatch were also examined for the presence of MDV genome by in situ hybridization. The number of ALV-induced hyperplastic follicles was significantly higher in chickens inoculated with serotype 2 MDV than in unvaccinated chickens or in chickens vaccinated with HVT. In contrast, the lowest number of hyperplastic follicles was noted in chickens vaccinated with HVT, regardless of strain of ALV used. These results suggest that enhancement of lymphoid leukosis may result from an increase in the number of ALV-induced hyperplastic follicles caused by the MDV and also that the enhancing effect of MDV on ALV-induced lymphomagenesis may occur at the stage of formation of hyperplastic follicles in the bursa.","['Marsh, J D', 'Bacon, L D', 'Fadly, A M']","['Marsh JD', 'Bacon LD', 'Fadly AM']","['U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, East Lansing, Michigan 48823, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/pathology', '*Avian Leukosis Virus', 'Bursa of Fabricius/*pathology', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/classification/*immunology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*immunology/pathology', 'Serotyping', 'Time Factors', '*Viral Vaccines']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Avian Dis. 1995 Oct-Dec;39(4):743-51.,,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of magnetic field exposure was studied on cells initially exhibiting (1) non-oscillating, low Ca2+ concentration and (2) prolonged Ca2+ concentration oscillations. In case (1) the result was negative. In case (2), statistically significant changes were found: the oscillation amplitude was reduced on average by 30%, and the frequency composition was shifted towards higher frequencies.","['Galvanovskis, J', 'Sandblom, J', 'Bergqvist, B', 'Galt, S', 'Hamnerius, Y']","['Galvanovskis J', 'Sandblom J', 'Bergqvist B', 'Galt S', 'Hamnerius Y']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Polylysine', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/02 00:00,1996/02/02 00:01,['1996/02/02 00:00'],"['1996/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0048-9697(95)04916-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0048-9697(95)04916-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 1996 Feb 2;180(1):19-33. doi: 10.1016/0048-9697(95)04916-9.,,"['25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects exposed occupationally to radiofrequencies (RF) and microwaves (MW) were selected from the population on the basis of their service records and documented exposures at service posts. The population size varied slightly from year to year with a mean count of about 128,000 persons each year; each year about 3700 of them (2.98%) were considered as occupationally exposed to RF/MW. All subjects (exposed and non-exposed to RF/MW) were divided into age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59). All newly registered cases of cancer were divided into 12 types based on localisation of the malignancy; for neoplasms of the haemopoietic system and lymphatic organs an additional analysis based on diagnosis was performed. Morbidity rates (per 100,000 subjects annually) were calculated for all of the above localisations and types of malignancies both for the whole population and for the age groups. The mean value of 15 annual rates during 1971-1985 represented the respective morbidity rate for the whole period. Morbidity rates in the non-exposed groups of personnel were used as 'expected' (E) rates for the exposed subjects, while the real morbidity rates counted in the RF/MW-exposed personnel served as 'observed' (O) rates. This allowed the calculation of the observed/expected ratio (OER) representing the odds ratio for the exposed groups. The cancer morbidity rate for RF/MW-exposed personnel for all age groups (20-59 years) reached 119.1 per 100,000 annually (57.6 in non-exposed) with an OER of 2.07, significant at P < 0.05. The difference between observed and expected values results from higher morbidity rates due to neoplasms of the alimentary tract (OER = 3.19-3.24), brain tumours (OER = 1.91) and malignancies of the haemopoietic system and lymphatic organs (OER = 6.31). Among malignancies of the haemopoietic/lymphatic systems, the largest differences in morbidity rates between exposed and non-exposed personnel were found for chronic myelocytic leukaemia (OER = 13.9), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (OER = 8.62) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (OER = 5.82).","['Szmigielski, S']",['Szmigielski S'],"['Department of Biological Effect of Non-Ionizing Radiations, Center for Radiobiology and Radiation Safety at the Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,IM,"['Adult', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Microwaves', 'Middle Aged', 'Military Personnel', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Poland/epidemiology', '*Radio Waves']",1996/02/02 00:00,1996/02/02 00:01,['1996/02/02 00:00'],"['1996/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0048-9697(95)04915-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0048-9697(95)04915-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 1996 Feb 2;180(1):9-17. doi: 10.1016/0048-9697(95)04915-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is successfully used in the differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, we studied signal transduction in RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. Histamine and the H2-receptor agonist, impromidine, induced both rises in cAMP levels and cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Substances acting at post-receptor sites to increase cAMP did not increase [Ca2+]i. H2- but not H1-receptor antagonists inhibited histamine-induced cAMP accumulation and rises in [Ca2+]i were more effectively inhibited by H2- than by H1-receptor antagonists. Histamine-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were completely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and were abolished by the blocker of NSC channels, Gd3+, but were resistant to inhibition by pertussis toxin. Unlike FMLP, histamine did not activate PLC. The effects of FMLP on [Ca2+]i were less sensitive to blockade by Gd3+ than those of histamine, and there was no cross-desensitization between the two stimuli. FMLP, but not histamine, inhibited transiently thapsigargin-induced rises in [Ca2+]. Taken together, our results show that histamine activates AC-mediated cAMP accumulation in RA-differentiated HL-60 cells via H2-receptors and NSC channel-mediated Ca2+ influx via H2- (and H1)-receptors. Histamine-induced NSC channel activation is not the consequence of AC- or PLC stimulation and occurs, directly or indirectly, via pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. FMLP and histamine activate Ca2+ influx by different mechanisms. There are similarities in H2-receptor-mediated signal transduction between RA-differentiated HL-60 cells and HL-60 promyelocytes and differences between the former cells and neutrophils, indicating that RA-differentiated HL-60 cells must be considered as partially immature.","['Burde, R', 'Seifert, R']","['Burde R', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Histamine/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00168748 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 1996 Jan;353(2):123-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00168748.,,"['0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The same procedure has also allowed dose-escalation of standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant disease of nonhematological origin. Unit recently, bone marrow has been the sole source of hematopoietic stem cells, but limitations of conventional bone marrow transplantation have stimulated a search for alternative sources and uses of stem cells. Fetal tissues (especially liver) are a recognized source of transplantable stem cells and offer the great advantage of reduced immunogenicity, potentially removing the problems of tissue type matching. Umbilical cord blood is also a rich source of stem cells and, although it contains alloreactive cells, it is readily available without special ethical constraints. Both fetal tissue and cord blood suffer the disadvantages of limited numbers of stem cells per donation, and there is much interest in the development of technologies for the safe and reliable expansion and/or pooling of stem and progenitor cells. The observation that small numbers of stem cells are found in the peripheral blood of adults has led to the exploitation of the blood as a further source of stem cells. The ability to mobilize these cells from the medullary compartment into the periphery by the use of chemotherapy and/or recombinant hematopoietic growth factors has enabled the collection of sufficient numbers of cells for transplantation purposes. All of these advances are increasing the options and the range of choices available to clinicians and patients in the arena of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Amos, T A', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Amos TA', 'Gordon MY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fetal Tissue Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0963689795000372 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 1995 Nov-Dec;4(6):547-69.,,,,,,256,,,,,,,,

We have further investigated this role and show here that the generation of neurons in cultures of embryonic day 10 spinal cord cells is inhibited by antibodies to the beta subunit of the LIF receptor. Since there are more undifferentiated precursors in antibody-treated cultures than in control and LIF-treated cultures, it is concluded that the primary action of LIF, or related molecules, is to promote neuronal differentiation, not precursor survival. In addition, the failure of LIF to support neuronal survival in the period immediately following differentiation suggests that the increased numbers of neurons generated with LIF are not attributable to its neurotrophic action. By selecting neuronal precursors on the basis of their inability to express class 1 major histocompatibility complex molecules, it was shown that LIF acted directly upon these cells and not via an intermediary cell. LIF also appears to be involved in regulating the differentiation of astrocytes, since it increases the number of glial fibrillary protein (GFAP)-positive cells present in the cultures and since the spontaneous production of GFAP-positive cells is blocked by antibodies to the LIF beta receptor. These findings suggest that LIF or related factors promote the differentiation of neural precursors in the spinal cord, but that they are not involved in preferentially promoting precursors down a specific differentiation pathway.","['Richards, L J', 'Kilpatrick, T J', 'Dutton, R', 'Tan, S S', 'Gearing, D P', 'Bartlett, P F', 'Murphy, M']","['Richards LJ', 'Kilpatrick TJ', 'Dutton R', 'Tan SS', 'Gearing DP', 'Bartlett PF', 'Murphy M']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Collaborative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, Royal Melbourne Hospital, 3050 Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Biological Factors/pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cricetinae', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Fibronectins/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Laminin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects', 'Ornithine/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/*embryology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01213.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1996 Feb;8(2):291-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01213.x.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is expressed mostly in tissues of mesoderm and neuroectoderm origin, and is thought to play an important role in the mesoderm induction. Although hematopoietic cells derive from the mesoderm, relatively few studies have, until recently, addressed the role of FGF-2 in hematopoiesis. FGF-2 is expressed in cells of the bone marrow including stromal cells, and possibly cells from several hematopoietic cell lineages. It is stored in the bone marrow extra-cellular matrix and released by enzymes such as heparanase, plasmin, or phospholipase C and D. FGF-receptors (FGF-Rs) are expressed in leukemic cell lines and in hematopoietic cells. FGF-2 positively regulates hematopoiesis, by acting on stromal cells, on early and committed hematopoietic progenitors, and possibly on some mature blood cells. The action of FGF-2 is most likely indirect since its action, on megakaryocytopoiesis for example, is abrogated by anti-IL6 antibodies. It synergizes with hematopoietic cytokines, or antagonizes the negative regulatory effects of TGF-beta. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FGF-2 is a potent hematopoietic growth factor that is likely to play an important role in physiological and pathological hematopoiesis.","['Allouche, M', 'Bikfalvi, A']","['Allouche M', 'Bikfalvi A']","['Laboratoire CNRS, Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Prog Growth Factor Res,Progress in growth factor research,8912757,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/analysis', 'Stromal Cells/physiology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0955-2235(95)00041-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Prog Growth Factor Res. 1995;6(1):35-48. doi: 10.1016/0955-2235(95)00041-0.,,"['0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,,86,,,,,,,,

The obtained data are applied to studying changes in cation and water balance in the Jurkat lymphoid cells equilibrated to hyposmotic solutions. It is concluded that a steady state volume regulation in Jurkat cells, maintained in hyposmotic media 180 mosM for up to 24 h, is achieved due mainly to non-ionic mechanisms. Under the lower osmolarity of the media, 155 mosM, the ionic cell volume regulation occurs. The increase in PCl and/or the decrease in Na-Cl symport (or its equivalent, e.g. Na/H and Cl/HCO3 exchange) are considered as the most probable cause of the long-term volume decrease in lymphoid cells.","['Vereninov, A A', 'Glushankova, L N', 'Rubashkin, A A']","['Vereninov AA', 'Glushankova LN', 'Rubashkin AA']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Humans', 'Ion Transport', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Mathematics', '*Models, Biological', 'Osmosis', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water/*metabolism', 'Water-Electrolyte Balance']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 1995;37(12):1151-66.,,"['059QF0KO0R (Water)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,Rol' ionnykh transporterov v dolgovremennoi reguliatsii soderzhaniia vody v zhivotnykh kletkakh.

HMBA alters factors controlling G1-to-S phase transition, leading to G1 arrest and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Among the inducer-mediated changes, suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase cdk4, which may be required for phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRB and perhaps p107, is critical in the pathway of terminal differentiation. HMBA induces an increase in the level of p21 which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity and, in turn, may cause cells to arrest in G1. p107 complexes with transcription factor E2F, which may alter E2F-dependent gene transcription. the relationship of the inducer-mediated changes in cyclins, cdks, cyclin-cdk inhibitors and transcription factors to the expression of differentiation-specific genes has not yet been established. The hybrid polar compounds are potent inducers of differentiation of a wide variety of transformed cells. HMBA has been shown to induce differentiation of neoplastic cells in patients. A second generation of hybrid polar compounds have been synthesized which are up to 1000 fold more potent than HMBA on a molar basis as inducers of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and other transformed cells in vitro.

We have previously reported that NZB-derived malignant B-1 cells, which serve as a murine model for human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, demonstrate altered expression of surface IgM and CD45 signalling molecules, and a failure to proliferate following membrane IgM stimulation. To examine receptor-mediated cytosolic calcium (Cai) signalling in B cell leukaemia, we studied IgM-induced Cai responses in malignant B-1 cells and B cells from non-leukaemic mice. Basal Cai was slightly lower in malignant B-1 cells than in non-leukaemic cells. Anti-IgM stimulation induced a sustained increase in Cai to levels 1.3-fold greater than basal Cai in conventional B cells. In contrast, leukaemic B-1 cells demonstrated a sharp but transient rise in Cai followed by a gradual increase to levels 2.3-fold greater than basal [Ca]i Ca influx from extracellular sources contributed to the early and late Cai signal in both sets of cells. Pre-incubation (2-30 min) with anti-CD45 had no effect on basal Cai or the anti-IgM Cai signal in B cells, but reduced the Cai transient in malignant B-1 cells. Additional experiments characterized the effects of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on the Cai profile following anti-IgM stimulation. Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors decreased the anti-IgM-induced Cai transient in malignant B-1 cells by 80%, but only moderately affected (40%) of the Cai response in non-leukaemic B cells. Protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors and protein kinase C (PKC) activators attenuated the Cai response to the same degree in normal and leukaemic B cells. These results show that Cai signalling differs widely between non-malignant B cells and malignant B-1 cells, and that tyrosine phosphorylation and CD45 modulation of IgM signalling are involved in the altered Cai responses in malignant B-1 cells.","['Dang, A M', 'Balasubramanyam, M', 'Garcia, Z', 'Raveche, E', 'Gardner, J P']","['Dang AM', 'Balasubramanyam M', 'Garcia Z', 'Raveche E', 'Gardner JP']","['Department of Pathology, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Protein Kinase C/pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1995.81 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1995 Dec;73(6):511-20. doi: 10.1038/icb.1995.81.,,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis showed 4-HPR to cause partial cell arrest in the G2/M phase after a 3-day treatment and an additional G1 phase arrest after a 7-day treatment. With RA-treated cells, a reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase was observed after 7 days of treatment. In 4-HPR-treated cells an extra peak, characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, was found in the cell cycle phase distribution analysis. Determination of specific protein expression changes by Western blot analysis showed that the p34cdc2 was down-regulated by both chemicals. Furthermore, RA induced bcl-2 but prevented the processing of actin, whereas 4-HPR had little effect on bcl-2 but increased the specific processing of actin. These results suggest that RA promotes neutrophil differentiation and the establishment of a semi apoptosis-resistant state, possibly through the overexpression of the bcl-2 gene. By contrast, 4-HPR may trigger apoptosis by inducing overall cyto-architectural changes and specific DNA fragmentation subsequent to increased turnover of the protein actin.","['Dipietrantonio, A', 'Hsieh, T C', 'Wu, J M']","['Dipietrantonio A', 'Hsieh TC', 'Wu JM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/07/25 00:00,1996/07/25 00:01,['1996/07/25 00:00'],"['1996/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)91109-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.1109 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Jul 25;224(3):837-42. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1109.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

More slowly migrating proteins with an apparent molecular mass of roughly 110 kDa interact strongly with the nuclei, while faster migrating proteins displaying molecular masses roughly 84-85 kDa show lower affinity for the nuclear compartment. Similarly, TLE1 proteins with an apparent molecular mass of roughly 118 kDa exhibit higher affinity for the nuclear compartment than do faster migrating forms with apparent molecular masses of 90-93 kDa. Moreover, we show that the nuclear, more slowly migrating, TLE1 proteins are induced during neural determination of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells.

In view of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic, as well as the improved survival of patients with prolonged neutropenia owing to better intensive care units, there is reason to believe that other as yet undocumented clinicopathologic manifestations of invasive candidiasis or other opportunistic infections may come to light.","['Moyana, T N', 'Kulaga, A', 'Xiang, J']","['Moyana TN', 'Kulaga A', 'Xiang J']","['Department of Pathology, Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Adult', 'Appendicitis/*complications/*microbiology/pathology', '*Candidiasis', 'Female', 'Granuloma/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1996 Feb;120(2):203-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 7087 people underwent an annual health check, and those with arthropathy had further physical and radiological examinations by rheumatologists. The presence of HTLV-I antibody was determined by the particle agglutinin method, and integration of the proviral DNA in peripheral lymphocytes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HTLV-I was positive in 26.1% of inhabitants; the incidence increased to 37.0% in patients with symptoms of polyarthritis. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was significantly different between HTLV-I carriers (0.56%) and non-carriers (0.31%). The stage of bone destruction in HTLV-I carriers with articular symptoms was milder than that in RA patients without HTLV-I. The relative risk of HTLV-I infection for polyarthritis was 1.66 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This is the first epidemiological report clarifying the association between HTLV-I and polyarthritis. Our results suggest that this viral infection has a relationship to RA.","['Motokawa, S', 'Hasunuma, T', 'Tajima, K', 'Krieg, A M', 'Ito, S', 'Iwasaki, K', 'Nishioka, K']","['Motokawa S', 'Hasunuma T', 'Tajima K', 'Krieg AM', 'Ito S', 'Iwasaki K', 'Nishioka K']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Nagasaki Chuo National Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Rheum Dis,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,0372355,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/epidemiology/*virology', 'Carrier State', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Risk']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/ard.55.3.193 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Rheum Dis. 1996 Mar;55(3):193-5. doi: 10.1136/ard.55.3.193.,PMC1010128,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a combination of IDA with Ara-C, which is the main metabolite of BH-AC, was evaluated with regard to its in vitro cytotoxic activity on mouse P 388 leukemic cells. The effect of this combination proved to be additive according to isobologram analysis. Secondly, the antitumor activity of an intravenous bolus-administration of a combination of BH-AC and IDA was evaluated by the life span of P 388 bearing mice, and compared with the activity of the Ara-C and IDA combination. The antitumor activity of Ara-C administered alone was clearly dependent on the administration schedule and was most intense when Ara-C was administered with the most frequent injections (3 bolus injections/day x 3 days), whereas antitumor activity of BH-AC was less dependent on the schedule. IDA administered alone showed dose-dependency in its antitumor activity up to 3 mg/kg. The maximum effects of IDA were observed with amounts of 3 - 4 mg/kg. In the same leukemia model, the combination of frequent injections of BH-AC and a single injection of IDA (increased life span: ILS>300%; cure ratio: CR = 3/5) conferred a more potent effect compared to the results of BH-AC (ILS = 133%, CR = 0/5) or IDA (ILS = 67%, CR = 2/5) alone. The effect of BH-AC and IDA combination was comparable or superior to that of the Ara-C and IDA (ILS = 233%, CR = 2/5) combination.

It was the aim of the present study to elucidate the role of macrophage activation during the growth and rejection of highly immunogenic murine leukemia P388/adria cell line which was made resistant by suboptimal treatment of mice with adriablastin during the serial passaging of parental P388 cells. The functional activity of peritoneal macrophages and the serum level of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were studied in different groups of mice. Mice from group 1 (control) received saline. Mice from group 2 (tumor bearers) with fast subcutaneous (s.c) 100% tumor growth were compared with animals from group 3 that had been twice previously immunized with lethally irradiated P388/adria cells and later inoculated with viable tumor cells. Tumors grew in only 25% of group 3 animals with a significant delay. The activity of peritoneal macrophages was studied by NO2- production and the NBT-test. Both tests revealed the early high systemic activation of macrophages in group 2. This coincided with the elevation of serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. This effect was not dependent on whether alive or lethally irradiated tumor cells were inoculated. The NO2- production by peritoneal macrophages correlated well with the dynamics of serum cytokine levels while the NBT-test did not. Studies on group 3 showed total abrogation of early macrophage and cytokine reactions. The production of inhibitory factors by macrophages in previously immunized mice is suggested. The fact that the early activation of macrophages and increase of serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines occurred in animals with fast growing tumors, which was decreased or absent in animals with tumor delay or rejections, allows us to suppose that this reaction plays more a supporting than a protecting role for tumor growth.","['Kisseleva, E', 'Becker, M', 'Lemm, M', 'Fichtner, I']","['Kisseleva E', 'Becker M', 'Lemm M', 'Fichtner I']","['Institute for Experimental Medicine, St. Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*blood', '*Doxorubicin/therapeutic use/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Jul-Aug;16(4A):1971-8.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DU-145 and PC-3 had minimal growth inhibition with PSAP-antipol alone or PSAP-antitop alone. However, when cotransfected with PSAP-antipol and PSAP-antitop, DU-145 and PC-3 displayed 42% and 55% growth inhibition, respectively. In contrast, no cytotoxicity was observed in the remaining 5 cell lines when transfected with PSAP-antipol, PSAP-antitop or both.

In this study we analyzed the clinical, histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features of 84 skin lesions from 42 patients (M:F = 1.3:1; mean age, 66.0 years; range, 42-83 years) with specific cutaneous manifestations of B-CLL. The duration of B-CLL before skin manifestations varied from 0 to 142 months (mean, 39 months). In seven patients (16.7%), skin lesions represented the first sign of disease. Clinical presentations included localized or generalized erythematous papules, plaques, nodules, and large tumors. Ulceration was uncommon. In six patients lesions were confined at the sites of scars from previous herpes zoster (four patients) or herpes simplex (two patients) eruptions. Histologically, three main patterns were recognized: (a) patchy perivascular and periadnexal, (b) nodular-diffuse, and (c) band-like. Cytomorphologically, small monomorphous lymphocytes predominated. Proliferation centers were observed in only four specimens. In two patients presenting with tumors, a high content of large cells with feature of centroblasts and immunoblasts was found (Richter's syndrome). Immunohistologic analyses were performed on paraffin-embedded specimens in 40 biopsies from 20 patients and on cryostat sections in 17 biopsies from 11 patients. Neoplastic B lymphocytes in all cases showed an aberrant phenotype (paraffin sections: CD20+/CD5+/CD43+; cryostat sections: CD19+/CD5+; immunoglobulin light-chain restriction). Proliferation markers (Ki67, PCNA, MIB1) stained 5 to 80% of cells (mean, 25%; median, 20%). Polymerase chain reaction performed in nine cases on paraffin-embedded tissues using consensus primers for immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes showed a monoclonal population of B lymphocytes in all cases. Several discrete bands in addition to the prominent ones were noted in five cases, indicating the additional presence of B lymphocytes whose immunoglobulin genes were not monoclonally but oligoclonally rearranged. Follow-up data could be obtained from 31 patients. The two patients with Richter's syndrome died after 5 and 8 months, respectively. The 5-year survival of patients with small-cell cutaneous B-CLL was 66.6%.

The CD117 ligand is stem cell factor, an important hematopoietic regulator. CD117 is present on approximately 4% of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells and in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis, but rarely in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Initially viewed as a primitive myeloid marker, CD117 has been identified in all FAB subtypes of AML and may predict poor outcome. CD34, a primitive stem cell marker, may also predict poor outcome. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between CD117 and CD34 expression on leukemic blasts and to determine whether CD117 is related to lymphoid-associated antigen (LAA) expression in AML. Consecutive bone marrow samples were studied from cases of AML (30 cases), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (4 cases), myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis (MPD-BC) (6 cases), and ALL (5 cases). Cases were diagnosed according to FAB criteria and included M0 (3 cases), M1 (2 cases), M2 (13 cases), M3 (1 case), M4 (6 cases), M5 (3 cases), M6 (1 case), AML NOS (1 case), RAEB (3 cases), and RAEB-T (1 case). CD117 and CD34 were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Blasts in 10 de novo AML samples were CD117+/CD34+ in 4 cases, CD117+/CD34-in 3 cases, CD117-/CD34+ in 1 case, and CD117-/ CD34- in 2 cases. Blasts in 20 cases of relapsed AML were CD117+/ CD34+ in 13 cases, CD117+/CD34- in 6 cases, and CD117-/CD34+ in 1 case. Blasts in MDS were CD117+/CD34+ in 3 cases, CD117-/ CD34+ in 1 case. Blasts in MPD-BC were CD117+/CD34+ in 4 cases, CD117-/CD34+ in 2 cases. Blasts in ALL were CD117+/CD34+ in 1 case, CD117-/CD34+ in 1 case, CD117-/CD34- in 3 cases. Of 26 cases of CD117+ AML, CD4 was expressed in 15 (58%) cases, CD7 in 7 (27%) cases, and CD2 in 2 (8%) cases. CD117/CD34 expression did not correlate with FAB subtype of AML. CD117 is borne on most leukemic blasts of myeloid origin (in this study, 87% of AML, 80% of MPD-myeloid BC, and 75% of MDS) and does not exclude expression of LAA. Although CD117 is a receptor for stem cell factor, its expression does not appear to correlate with CD34 positivity.","['Wells, S J', 'Bray, R A', 'Stempora, L L', 'Farhi, D C']","['Wells SJ', 'Bray RA', 'Stempora LL', 'Farhi DC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/106.2.192 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 Aug;106(2):192-5. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/106.2.192.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of LAA expression in AML and MPD/MBC (Ly + AML); to assess lymphoid differentiation at the genomic level in Ly + AML; and to compare features of Ly + AML with AML and MPD/MBC lacking these antigens (Ly-AML). Seventy-four consecutive cases of AML and MPD/MBC were reviewed for blast morphology, TdT reactivity, and cytochemistry results. Blast immunophenotyping was performed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Acute myeloid leukemia was subtyped according to the FAB classification. Acute myeloid leukemia and MPD/MBC cases expressing one or more of the following antigens, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD19, or CD20, were considered to be Ly + AML. Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies were performed by Southern blot analysis using probes for JH, Jkappa, and JBI/BII. Sixteen of the 74 cases (22%) were identified as Ly + AML. Of these, the T-cell-associated markers CD7, CD2, and CD5 were expressed on 7(44%), 6(38%), and 4(25%) Ly + AML cases, respectively. The B-cell-associated markers CD19 and CD20 were expressed on two cases (13%) and one (6%) case, respectively. The FAB subtypes were similarly represented among Ly + AML and Ly-AML. Expression of LAA did not correlate with TdT positivity. In nine cases of Ly + AML (7 expressing T-cell-associated antigens and two expressing B-cell-associated antigens), Southern blot analysis revealed no Ig or TCR gene rearrangements. These results suggest that expression of CD2, CD5, and CD7 in otherwise straightforward AML should not be taken as evidence of lymphoid lineage commitment and does not warrant a diagnosis of AMLL.","['Launder, T M', 'Bray, R A', 'Stempora, L', 'Chenggis, M L', 'Farhi, D C']","['Launder TM', 'Bray RA', 'Stempora L', 'Chenggis ML', 'Farhi DC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/106.2.185 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 Aug;106(2):185-91. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/106.2.185.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Data at the level of the 459 district level local authorities in England, Wales and regional districts in Scotland are analysed in two complementary ways: first, by Poisson regressions with the inclusion of environmental covariates and a smooth spatial structure; secondly, by a hierarchical Bayesian model in which extra-Poisson variability is modelled explicitly in terms of spatial and non-spatial components. From this analysis, we deduce a strong indication that a main part of the variability is accounted for by a local neighbourhood 'clustering' structure. This structure is furthermore relatively stable over the 15 year period for the lymphocytic leukaemias which make up the majority of observed cases. We found no evidence of a positive association of childhood leukaemia incidence with outdoor or indoor gamma radiation levels. There is no consistent evidence of any association with radon levels. Indeed, in the Poisson regressions, a significant positive association was only observed for one 5-year period, a result which is not compatible with a stable environmental effect. Moreover, this positive association became clearly non-significant when over-dispersion relative to the Poisson distribution was taken into account.","['Richardson, S', 'Monfort, C', 'Green, M', 'Draper, G', 'Muirhead, C']","['Richardson S', 'Monfort C', 'Green M', 'Draper G', 'Muirhead C']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/adverse effects', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', '*Models, Statistical', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.4780142116 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 1995 Nov 15-30;14(21-22):2487-501. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780142116.,,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A high fat intake is associated with a greater mammary cancer risk in humans and in animal models. Higher intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids in humans shows little or no association with mammary tumor development in epidemiologic surveys. From literature data, it appears that a higher intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid) is related to an increase in mammary tumorigenesis in animal studies in which chemical carcinogens like dimethylbenz[a]anthracene are used as tumor initiator. Mostly the latency period of these chemically induced models in rather short. In this study, the Bald/c-MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) mouse strain was chosen as an animal model: MMTV leads to tumor initiation, and dietary factors influence tumor promotion over a relatively long latency period. The mice were fed diets with two fat concentrations: a high [36% of energy (en%)] or low (16 en%) fat level; fat was isocalorically replaced by carbohydrates (cornstarch). At both dietary fat levels, linoleic acid was given at four levels: 2, 3, 6, and 10 en%. Linoleic acid-rich fat was isocalorically replaced by oleic acid-rich fat. The diets were consumed ad libitum over a lifetime. Animals were euthanized as soon as mammary tumor diameter was > or = 1 cm or when the animals were in a poor clinical condition. The incidence of mammary tumors at 18 months was significantly higher in one group only: 36 en% fat and 2 en% linoleic acid. This group also showed the shortest mean latency period for mammary tumor development. Mean mammary tumor incidence was higher and mean onset time shorter in the four high-fat groups than in the low-fat groups. No (linear) dose-response relationship between dietary linoleic acid concentration and mammary tumor incidence and latency period was observed. This indicates that a higher dietary linoleic acid intake does not increase the incidence or shorten the latency period of breast cancer in the Balb/c-MMTV mouse strain at two different dietary fat levels.","['Ritskes-Hoitinga, J', 'Meijers, M', 'Timmer, W G', 'Wiersma, A', 'Meijer, G W', 'Weststrate, J A']","['Ritskes-Hoitinga J', 'Meijers M', 'Timmer WG', 'Wiersma A', 'Meijer GW', 'Weststrate JA']","['Department of Diet and Health Research, Unilever Research Laboratorium, Vlaardingen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Dietary Fats/*administration & dosage', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/mortality', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology/mortality/pathology', '*Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635589609514438 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1996;25(2):161-72. doi: 10.1080/01635589609514438.,,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Linoleic Acids)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we characterize the half-site bound by both Pbx1 and Hox proteins on a prototypic element (TGATTAAT) and determine how the orientation of the Hox protein contributes to the DNA binding specificity of Pbx-Hox heterodimers. We demonstrate that the Hox protein binds the 3' TAAT sequence as its recognition core and exhibits sequence-specific binding at positions 3' to the TAAT core. Unfavored sequences at this position, such as two cytosines, abrogate binding to the element. The upstream Pbx1 core sequence, TGAT, must immediately juxtapose the Hox core. This geometry maintains the preference of Hox/HOM-C proteins for a T base at position -1, as T represents the fourth position of the Pbx1 core, and suggests that this T base is bound by both Pbx1 and Hox proteins, Pbx1 binding in the major grove and the Hox protein binding in the minor grove.

Most mutations found are of missense type and located in the central region of the gene (exons 5 to 8). In the present study, a germline p53 alteration was identified in a late onset breast cancer family (kindred Lund 5; mean age 58 years) using single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. The mutation (a CCG to CTG transition) at codon 82 in exon 4, resulting in a proline to leucine substitution, has not previously been reported and was not present in a control set of 60 healthy individuals. Three of five woman with breast cancer (45, 57 and 65 years) were carriers of the alteration. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was not seen in the primary tumors of these women, but appeared as a partial loss of the wildtype allele in subsequent recurrent lesions of two gene carriers. The family manifested no linkage to the p53 gene (a two-point LOD-score of -0.41), and has previously also been excluded for linkage to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci, as well as being carrier of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Although it seems unlikely that the p53 germline mutation is the major cause of disease predisposition in Lund 5, the data suggest that some p53 alteration may confer a subtle influence on breast cancer development and progression.","['Sun, X F', 'Johannsson, O', 'Hakansson, S', 'Sellberg, G', 'Nordenskjold, B', 'Olsson, H', 'Borg, A']","['Sun XF', 'Johannsson O', 'Hakansson S', 'Sellberg G', 'Nordenskjold B', 'Olsson H', 'Borg A']","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Genetic Linkage', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree']",1996/07/18 00:00,1996/07/18 00:01,['1996/07/18 00:00'],"['1996/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jul 18;13(2):407-11.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML-1/ETO and TEL/AML-1 fusion proteins, created by the t(8;21) and t(12;21) respectively, disrupt AML-1B-dependent transcription. Recently, two human members of the runt homology domain family of transcription factors have been identified, AML-2 and AML-3, which also regulate transcription through enhancer core motifs. If multiple factors regulate transcription through the same site, a dominant interfering protein may be required to promote leukemogenesis, rather than the inactivation of both AML1 alleles. To determine which AML family proteins are active in hematopoietic cells, we developed antisera specific to each family member for use in gel mobility shift assays. We have found that AML-1B is the major DNA binding activity in T-cell lines, while both AML-1B and AML-2 are expressed in myeloid and B-cell lines. AML-1B represents most of the active protein in the mouse thymus, whereas AML-1 and AML-2 are equally expressed in the mouse spleen. AML-3 is expressed at very low levels in a single myeloid cell line, 32D.3, and is the only core binding activity present in Buffalo rat liver cells. We demonstrate that AML-2-dependent transactivation mediated by enhancer core motifs is inhibited by the AML-1/ETO and TEL/AML-1 fusion proteins. This indicates that the t(8;21) and t(12;21) fusion proteins inhibit transcriptional activation by the AML-1 transcription factor family, and in so doing contributes to leukemogenesis.","['Meyers, S', 'Lenny, N', 'Sun, W', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Meyers S', 'Lenny N', 'Sun W', 'Hiebert SW']","[""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/18 00:00,1996/07/18 00:01,['1996/07/18 00:00'],"['1996/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jul 18;13(2):303-12.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']","['5 P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein, which is activated transiently in normal myeloid cells by cytokines such as GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor), was constitutively activated in cell lines derived from CML patients, even in the absence of GM-CSF. STAT5 was also activated in primary mouse bone marrow cells acutely transformed by the CML-specific BCR-ABL oncogene, but not by the serine kinase oncogene v-MOS. Reconstitution experiments in non-hematopoietic cells show that STAT5 activation by BCR-ABL occurs independent of cytokines. Results using BCR-ABL mutants which specifically uncouple connections to known signal transduction pathways show that STAT5 activation is kinase dependent and correlates directly with ability to confer cytokine independent growth in hematopoietic cells.

Addition of lovastatin (30 microM) to HEL cells in culture inhibited protein synthesis by approximately 35%. However, this treatment resulted in a 5-fold increase, as quantitated by [alpha-32P]GTP binding, in the amount of cytosolic 24 kDa GTP-binding protein. Addition of cycloheximide plus lovastatin to cells in culture abolished the observed increase in 24 kDa GTP-binding protein. Incubation of cells with lovastatin plus [R,S]-[5-(3)H] mevalonolactone resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity into several polypeptides in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions including a polypeptide of molecular mass of 24 kDa in the cytosol. The mobility of this 24 kDa isoprenylated protein on SDS-PAGE was identical to that of the GTP-binding protein increased in response to lovastatin. However, the 24 kDa protein remained in the cytosol after undergoing isoprenylation. The 24 kDa protein was distinct from the HEL cell, G25K/CDC42Hs GTP-binding protein and the GTP-binding protein that was a substrate for botulinum toxin C3 catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Results demonstrate that lovastatin specifically increases the expression of a 24 kDa GTP-binding protein in HEL cells and that, isoprenylation of low molecular mass GTP-binding protein(s) may have function(s) in addition to its role in the targetting of these proteins to cell membrane.","['Bhullar, R P']",['Bhullar RP'],"['Department of Oral Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/metabolism', 'Anticholesteremic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', '*Botulinum Toxins', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Prenylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/09 00:00,1996/03/09 00:01,['1996/03/09 00:00'],"['1996/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00239320 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1996 Mar 9;156(1):59-67. doi: 10.1007/BF00239320.,,"['0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (exoenzyme C3, Clostridium botulinum)', 'EC 3.4.24.69 (Botulinum Toxins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we present a novel method that generates expression profiles of these receptors. The method was tested and optimized using the myeloblastic/ promyelocytic cell line KG1. The method involves PCR of cDNA using class III-specific degenerate primers and subsequent restriction enzyme digests of the 147 bp amplicons followed by fractionation on denaturing poly-acrylamide gels. This primary fingerprint of KG1 revealed equal expression of c-kit and flt3 and to a lesser extent PDGF-R alpha and c-fms. One residual band of unknown origin was seen and appeared to be the proto-oncogene RET following cloning and sequence analysis. This tyrosine kinase receptor is known to play an important role in neural development. In order to detect less abundantly expressed sequences, a secondary fingerprint was generated by pre-digestion of the receptors present in the primary expression profile and subsequent amplification of the residual band. No other tyrosine kinase receptors were observed in KG1. In conclusion, this method allows direct visualization of expression of the HGF-TKRs and has the potential to detect novel homologous receptors.","['Visser, M', 'Sonneveld, R D', 'Willemze, R', 'Landegent, J E']","['Visser M', 'Sonneveld RD', 'Willemze R', 'Landegent JE']","['Laboratory for Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Primers', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lung', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1395-9.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunofluorescence microscopic evaluation of cytocentrifuge preparations has remained the preferred technique for detection of intracellular antigens for a long time. Recently, flow cytometric detection of intracellular antigens has been improved by the development of new permeabilization/fixation solutions. We compared four commercially available solutions: FACS Brand Lysing Solution (FACS Brand; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), Fix & Perm cell permeabilization kit (Fix & Perm; An der Grub, Vienna, Austria), OptiLyse B lysing solution (OptiLyse B; Immunotech, Marseille, France), and ORTHO PermeaFix(PermeaFix; Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Raritan, NJ, USA). These solutions were evaluated for the complexity and duration of the intracellular staining procedure, the effects on light scatter patterns, and the staining results for the intracellular antigens terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), cytoplasmic CD3 (CyCD3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin light chains (CylgL). The four methods could easily be introduced in our laboratory and had only minor effect on the light scatter patterns of the tested cell samples. Each of the four tested antigens was detectable with at least one of the four methods. Only the Fix & Perm cell permeabilization kit could be used for reliable detection of all four intracellular antigens. In a large series of 450 BM and PB samples containing various percentages of TdT+ cells, the results of flow cytometric TdT staining with FACS Brand Lysing Solution were highly comparable to the results obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy (P = <0.00001).

The biochemical assay could detect TdT activity in the mixture containing NALM-18 cells at concentrations of more than 10 percent. The immunofluorescent (IF) method could detect positive cells in the mixture containing NALM-18 cells at concentrations of more than 1 percent. Furthermore, an approximately 10(5)-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained by the combination of RT-PCR and subsequent Southern blotting, as compared to biochemical assay. In many leukemia cases the expression of TdT-mRNA corresponded well to that of TdT protein. However, in some patients with leukemia, only TdT-mRNA was detectable by RT-PCR without any expression of TdT protein.

The molecular events governing the progression of CLL are poorly understood. In order to develop model systems for predicting the aggressiveness of leukemic clones in CLL, in vivo transplantation of SCID mice with CLL cells, and the in vitro growth of CLL cells on mouse and human stromal layers, were investigated. Bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from 40 patients at different stages of CLL were transplanted into 172 immune-deficient SCID mice. Thirty-five percent of SCID mice injected with CLL cells were positive for the presence of human DNA by Southern blot or PCR analysis. The most frequently involved sites were the spleen, lung, kidney and bone marrow, at levels corresponding from 0.1 to 10 percent human DNA. Thrice-weekly intraperitoneal injections of IL-2, alone or in combination with IL-7, did not increase the level of human cell engraftment. SCID mice developed endogenous thymic lymphomas at an incidence of 10-33 percent, a rate that was not increased by CLL cell transplantation. In vitro, CLL cells were able to proliferate for 9 weeks on human stromal layers supplemented with CM (conditioned media from a culture of the human bladder carcinoma cell line 5637), but failed to thrive on the murine stromal cell line MTE cultured either in CM or autologous serum. FACS analysis revealed that 81 percent of proliferating cells on human stromal layers carried the CD5 cell surface marker, identifying them as CLL cells. Previously EBV-negative CLL cells became EBV-positive after 9 to 12 weeks in culture. The results of this study provide a firm foundation for the development of in vivo and in vitro model systems for the study of human CLL.","['Hummel, J L', 'Lichty, B D', 'Reis, M', 'Dube, I', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Hummel JL', 'Lichty BD', 'Reis M', 'Dube I', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['Institute of Medical Sciences, Graduate Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1370-6.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of 24 lymphoid malignancies from patients with AIDS demonstrated HHV-8 sequences by Southern blot and PCR analyses. The fourth was positive by PCR only. None of the non-AIDS-associated lymphomas contained HHV-8 sequences. All three Southern blot positive samples were derived from extranodal regions, two from pleural effusions, and one from a soft tissue mass in the thigh. This latter patient initially presented with a pleural effusion. The fourth PCR positive but Southern blot negative tumor was from a gingival lymphoma in a patient with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 1 alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) induce differentiation of HL60 cells into CD11b+ mature granulocytes and monocytes, respectively. We studied telomerase activity after differentiation of HL60 cells. A marked inhibition of the enzyme activity was observed in the differentiated CD11b+ cells after 72-120 h treatment with either differentiating agent. In contrast, the VD3-treated CD11b- HL60 cells, which failed to undergo differentiation and human erythroleukemic cell line K562, exposed to ATRA retained high levels of telomerase activity. This finding suggests, that telomerase activity is repressed as a differentiation-associated event in HL60 cells. Our results provide the first evidence that immortal leukemic cells, like normal human cells, have a telomerase repressing mechanism which can be activated by differentiation and thus lead to the suppression of telomerase activity. This in vitro model may be useful for studies of the mechanisms controlling telomerase activity and in the search for physiological telomerase modulators.","['Xu, D', 'Gruber, A', 'Peterson, C', 'Pisa, P']","['Xu D', 'Gruber A', 'Peterson C', 'Pisa P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Granulocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Monocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1354-7.,,"['0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assess whether the analysis of distinct cell populations could provide differential information on the extent of the disease, we compared the proportion of residual normal cells in RBC, monocyte and PMN populations. The mean percentage of unaffected cells was higher in RBC as compared to PMN (50.5 +/- 18.7 vs 17.7 +/- 19.7, P < 0.0001). The proportion of normal PMN was, in turn, significantly greater than that of normal monocytes (17.7 +/- 19.7 vs 8.7 +/- 11.0; P < 0.05). The percentage of CD14+ monocytes was directly related to Hb concentration and platelet (Plt) count, and inversely to percent lysis at the Ham's test.

Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway has been implicated in IL-7R signaling. We investigated which STAT complexes are formed upon stimulation of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells with IL-7. Gel retardation assays with STAT-binding oligonucleotides showed that IL-7 induces the formation of two major STAT complexes in BCP-ALL cells. Supershifts with anti-STAT antibodies identified these as STAT1 and STAT5 complexes. This pattern of STAT activation was seen in all BCP-ALL cases that respond to IL-7 in proliferation assays. IL-7 also induced STAT/DNA binding in BCP-ALL cases that failed to proliferate in response to IL-7, suggesting that the ability of IL-7R to activate the JAK/STAT pathway per se is not sufficient for proliferation induction. To determine the contribution of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R alpha) to activation of STAT proteins, transfectants of the murine pro-B cell line BAF3 were made that express chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of human IL-7R alpha. Activation of the chimeric G-CSF-R/IL-7R alpha with G-CSF resulted in a full proliferative response and induced the phosphorylation of JAK1 but not JAK2. Major STAT complexes activated by G-CSF-R/IL-7R alpha contained STAT1 or STAT5, while some formation of STAT3-containing complexes was also seen. These findings establish that STAT1 and STAT5, and possibly STAT3, are activated upon stimulation of precursor B cells with IL-7. The data further indicate that the IL-7R alpha chains are directly involved in the activation of JAKs and STATs and have a major role in proliferative signaling in precursor B cells.","['van der Plas, D C', 'Smiers, F', 'Pouwels, K', 'Hoefsloot, L H', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I P']","['van der Plas DC', 'Smiers F', 'Pouwels K', 'Hoefsloot LH', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/chemistry/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/physiopathology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1317-25.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that both IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting the transcription rate of the IL-6 gene. The strong inhibition of the IL-6 transcription rate prompted us to study the effect of IL-10 and IL-4 on the expression of transcription factors. We questioned whether or not IL-10 and IL-4 affected the expression of transcription factors that are known to be involved in the control of the IL-6 transcription rate, namely activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL6), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) we showed that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced AP-1 binding activity. The inhibiting effect of IL-4 was slightly more pronounced than that of IL-10. Downregulation of LPS-induced AP-1 was accompanied, and thus possibly explained, by a reduced expression at mRNA level of the two major components of the AP-1 complex, namely c-fos and c-jun as determined by Northern experiments. Binding activity of NF-IL6 was also strongly inhibited by IL-4 whereas IL-10 showed no effect. NF-IL6 mRNA levels were not affected by IL-10 or IL-4, suggesting that IL-4 affects binding activity of preexisting NF-IL6. Neither IL-10 nor IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B binding activity. In agreement with this finding, Northern experiments where p65 and p105 mRNA levels were determined, demonstrated that expression of these components of the NF-kappa B transcription factor were not affected by IL-10 or IL-4. Furthermore, neither IL-10 nor IL-4 showed any effect on I-kappa B mRNA expression as determined by Northern experiments. Thus, IL-10 and IL-4 similarly affect IL-6 expression. However, for IL-4 this was accompanied with a reduction of AP-1 and NF-IL6 binding activity whereas IL-10 only inhibited AP-1 binding activity.","['Dokter, W H', 'Koopmans, S B', 'Vellenga, E']","['Dokter WH', 'Koopmans SB', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factor RelB', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1308-16.,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic studies showed 11q23 abnormalities in 24 of 27 ALL cases with MLL gene rearrangements. MLL gene rearrangements were significantly correlated with absence of CD10 expression and poor prognosis, but not with age under 6 months, hyperleukocytosis, myeloid-associated antigen expression, or CNS leukemia. The 3-year overall survival rate for ALL cases with MLL gene rearrangements was 5.3 +/- 5.2 percent, compared with 88.9 +/- 10.5 percent for cases with germline MLL (P=0.0001). Absence of CD10 expression was also associated with poor prognosis (9.9 +/- 6.6 percent vs 85.7 +/- 13.2 percent, P = 0.0003). Of the five AML cases, three have remained alive for 27 months to 67 months. These findings suggest that infant ALL with MLL gene rearrangement is strongly associated with poor prognosis.

PML/RAR alpha fusion transcripts were detected in all APL cases, including two cases lacking cytogenetic evidence of t(15;17). Breakpoint usage in PML was determined using a combination of PCR amplification with differing 5' primers, junction-specific probes, and sequence analysis in selected cases. Consistent with previously published data, case analysis demonstrated fusion products resulting from three breakpoint cluster regions (bcr) in PML, and a single breakpoint region in intron 2 of RAR alpha. Transcripts resulting from breakpoints in bcr1 were detected in 59 percent of cases, bcr2 in 27 percent and bcr3 in 14 percent.

A comparison with results in acute myeloid leukemia.,1269-73,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in children is often considered as a variant of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and frequently treated as such. However, there are very few reported data on the outcome following AML treatment. We analyzed 20 consecutive cases of de novo MDS treated in Denmark according to the NOPHO AML protocols. The results were compared with those obtained in 31 children with de novo AML treated with the same protocols, and with the outcome in 10 children with MDS who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) without prior AML therapy. Distinction between MDS and AML was made morphologically according to the FAB criteria. All children were followed for at least 37 months. The proportion of complete remission in MDS and AML was 35 percent vs 74 percent. (P = 0.005), resistant disease 25 percent vs 10 percent (P = 0.14), death in cytopenia 40 percent vs 16 percent (P= 0.06), and 3-year survival 15 percent vs 35 percent. (P = 0.11), respectively. Duration of treatment-related cytopenia was similar in MDS and AML, except for a longer period of leukopenia in MDS following the second course of induction. Seven of 10 MDS children receiving BMT without prior chemotherapy are long-term survivors. Our data suggest that conventional AML regimens are associated with a low rate of complete remission, a high risk of death in cytopenia, and a limited curative potential in childhood MDS. Allogeneic BMT was in contrast associated with a high survival rate. BMT may, at least in some patients, be performed successfully without prior induction chemotherapy. The different response to therapy in MDS and AML may reflect fundamental biological differences between the two conditions.","['Hasle, H', 'Kerndrup, G', 'Yssing, M', 'Clausen, N', 'Ostergaard, E', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Jacobsen, B B']","['Hasle H', 'Kerndrup G', 'Yssing M', 'Clausen N', 'Ostergaard E', 'Jacobsen N', 'Jacobsen BB']","['Department of Pediatrics, Odense University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1269-73.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it has been known for years that a variety of agents, including retinoids, could induce leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro, it was not until the initial report from Shanghai in 1988 that laboratory studies translated into clinical activity and benefit in patients. Since this initial report, a number of studies have confirmed that the majority of patients with both newly diagnosed and previously chemotherapy-treated patients with APL achieve complete remission (CR) with ATRA. In addition, the characteristic life-threatening coagulopathy resolves quickly. Several limitations to this approach have emerged, including the development of retinoid resistance, hyperleukocytosis and the retinoic acid syndrome, a constellation of findings including unexplained fever, fluid retention, pleuropericardial effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Although ATRA is very effective in inducing CR, its benefits compared to conventional chemotherapy are only now being addressed. The first prospective randomized trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone was terminated early because of an improved event-free survival for patients receiving ATRA. The benefit was attributable to a difference in relapse rate. A large, intergroup, prospective, randomized trial comparing conventional chemotherapy to ATRA for induction and ATRA to observation for maintenance has recently completed accrual and will provide insight into the emerging role of ATRA in patients with APL. ATRA represents the first example of a specific form of antileukemic therapy targeting a specific genetic abnormality and may serve as a paradigm for the development of differentiating therapy for patients with other hematologic malignancies.","['Tallman, M S']",['Tallman MS'],"['Northwestern University Medical School, Robert H Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Aug;10(8):1262-8.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,62,,,,,,,,

Cells that overcome the normal senescence mechanisms do so by stabilizing telomere length, probably due to the activity of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that synthesizes telomeric repeats. Most human primary tumors contain telomerase, while the cells of most normal tissues lack this activity. A hypothesis gaining prominence is that the activation of telomerase is necessary for the sustained growth of most solid tumors. Since normal hematopoietic stem cells and some of their progeny already express telomerase activity, it is important to consider whether or not telomere shortening and telomerase activity play any role in cancer progression in various forms of leukemia.

However, an additional possible tumorigenic mechanism is inhibition of normally occurring apoptosis. We have studied the mechanism of action of bcr-abl in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by inhibiting its expression using antisense oligonucleotides. K562 cells, derived initially from a patient with CML, were incubated with 16 microM 3',5'-capped bcr-abl antisense phosphodiester 18mer targeting the bcr-abl junctional sequence. Antisense reduced cell number by day 5 by 44% +/- 2.5% S.E. compared to nonsense or no-oligomer controls. Compared to nonsense oligomer, antisense oligomer reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation by only 13% +/- 1%. By the more reliable bromodeoxyuridine incorporation method, antisense had no inhibiting effect on DNA synthesis. In contrast to its minimal effect on DNA synthesis, antisense had a large effect on apoptosis. At day 4, after 3 days of oligomer treatment, antisense increased the proportion of cells with less than 2 N DNA 2.5 +/- 0.3-fold compared to nonsense, as revealed by analysis of DNA distribution following propidium iodide-staining. After 3 days of oligomer treatment and 24 h of serum deprivation, antisense increased the proportion of cells with less than 2 N DNA even more, over 3.1 +/- 1.1-fold compared to nonsense. Because CML cells are resistant to the induction of apoptosis (as judged by DNA laddering on electrophoresis, which requires double-stranded breaks), we also assayed the binding of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which requires only single-stranded DNA breaks. Antisense treatment for 3 days increased TdT binding at day 4 by 16.4 +/- 8.7-fold. We conclude that, in CML, bcr-abl may lead to the accumulation of myeloid cells to a greater extent by inhibiting apoptosis than by increasing cell division. This bcr-abl induced inhibition of apoptosis may thwart chemotherapy and foster the accumulation of further mutations leading to the development of the blastic phase of the disease.","['Rowley, P T', 'Keng, P C', 'Kosciolek, B A']","['Rowley PT', 'Keng PC', 'Kosciolek BA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(95)00172-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00172-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jun;20(6):473-80. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00172-7.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Very few EpoR genetic abnormalities have been reported so far. Polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by low/normal serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels with proposed Epo hypersensitivity. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by refractory anemia with variable serum Epo levels. Several reports have suggested EpoR abnormalities in both types of stem cell disorders. We analyzed DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of seven healthy controls, 20 patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD, 11 patients with PV, five agnogenic myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, four essential thrombocytosis) and eight patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), an MDS variant. The DNA was digested with four restriction enzymes (BamHI, Bgl II, Sacl and HindIII), followed by Southern blot, using a 32P radiolabeled probe, containing 1.5 kb of the human EpoR cDNA. All 20 MPD patients and seven out of the eight MDS patients demonstrated a restriction pattern which was identical to the seven normal controls, as well as to the erythroid cell line K562, and also consistent with the expected restriction map, for all four enzymes tested. One RARS patient had a normal pattern with three enzymes but a different one with HindIII. The HindIII 12 kb large band was replaced by a faint 12 kb band and a new (about 9 kb) band appeared. The EpoR restriction map and the normal pattern obtained with the other three enzymes suggest that this patient has a 3 kb upstream deletion in one allelic EpoR gene. The same molecular pattern was detected in the patient's sister, who suffers from anemia with mild bone marrow (BM) dyserythropoiesis and plasmacytosis. Northern blot analysis showed that the patient's BM RNA carried normal EpoR message. This familial pattern may represent polymorphism. However, the patient's very high serum Epo level, her resistance to treatment with recombinant Epo, and the abnormally low growth rate of in vitro erythroid cultures, suggesting poor response to Epo in this MDS patient as well as the hematological abnormalities in her sister, support the speculation that the different EpoR gene might serve as a genetic predisposing marker and potentially could be involved (probably via post-transcriptional mechanisms and by an interaction with other factors or cytokines) in the pathogenesis. Our data suggest that the EpoR is intact in MPD and in most patients with RARS. One RARS patient had a familial different genetic structure, which could represent polymorphism. However, we can speculate also that it might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Mittelman, M', 'Gardyn, J', 'Carmel, M', 'Malovani, H', 'Barak, Y', 'Nir, U']","['Mittelman M', 'Gardyn J', 'Carmel M', 'Malovani H', 'Barak Y', 'Nir U']","['Department of Medicine B, Hasharon Hospital, Petah-Tikva, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA/blood', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/blood/pharmacology', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00002-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00002-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jun;20(6):459-66. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00002-1.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to examine the possibility of retroviral etiology in AML, we determined retroviral antigens related to HTLV-I in leukemic cell samples from 32 AML cases and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from 20 healthy donors by D-IGSS with high sensitivity and specificity, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity by a simple and sensitive non-radioisotopic RT assay, and retroviral particles by electron microscopy. The HTLV-I-related antigens were detected in 50.0% (16/32) of fresh leukemic cell samples and 87.5% (28/32) of cultured leukemic cell samples. The HTLV-I-related antigen-positive cells in fresh and cultured leukemic samples were 10.2% and 52.8%, respectively. Both frequency and level of HTLV-I-related antigens in cultured samples were much higher than in fresh samples. In contrast, no HTLV-I-related antigens were found in normal hematopoietic cells from 20 healthy donors. Further study results show that RT activity was detected not only in HTLV-I-related antigen-positive samples, but was also well correlated with the level of HTLV-I-related antigens in these samples, and preferred Mn+2 to Mg+2 as a cation. Moreover, typical retroviral particles were localized in most cultured HTLV-I-related antigen-positive samples by immunoelectron microscope.

A transcript hybridizing with this sequence is expressed in normal C57BL/6 mice. The transcript, designated Edv, has been previously cloned and sequenced (Y. Kubo, Y. Nakagawa, K. Kakimi, H. Matsui, K. Higo, L. Wang, H. Kobayashi, T. Hirama, and A. Ishimoto, J. Gen. Virol. 75:881-888, 1994). Compared with the nucleotide sequence of the helper LP-BM5 ecotropic virus, the pathogenic replication-defective MAIDS virus has a 16-bp deletion and a 1-bp insertion in the 5' and 3' regions of the p12gag sequence, respectively, and the Edv transcript contains only a 3-bp deletion. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of the defective MAIDS virus p12gag region is not homologous to that of the helper virus and the Edv transcript because of the frameshift. To determine whether the amino acid sequence resulting from the frameshift is critical for MAIDS development, we constructed chimeric viruses that contained the p12gag regions of the helper virus and the Edv transcript, respectively, with and without the same frame as the defective MAIDS virus by the artificial frameshift mutations. The mutant viruses with the frameshift mutations induced MAIDS in inoculated mice, but the viruses without the mutations did not. These results suggested that the MAIDS virus was generated by frameshift mutations in the p12gag region of Edv or a related sequence.","['Kubo, Y', 'Kakimi, K', 'Higo, K', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Ono, T', 'Iwama, Y', 'Kuribayashi, K', 'Hiai, H', 'Adachi, A', 'Ishimoto, A']","['Kubo Y', 'Kakimi K', 'Higo K', 'Kobayashi H', 'Ono T', 'Iwama Y', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Hiai H', 'Adachi A', 'Ishimoto A']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'Codon', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis', 'Genes, env', '*Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.9.6405-6409.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Sep;70(9):6405-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.9.6405-6409.1996.,PMC190669,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using confocal microscopy, we found that Tax localizes to subnuclear domains which overlap with structures previously identified as interchromatin granules or spliceosomal speckles. These Tax speckled structures are coincident with a subset of nuclear transcriptional hot spots. Disruption of the Tax speckled structures by heat shock revealed the existence of different populations of Tax. One population of Tax is tightly associated with nuclear speckles.

BLV can be transmitted in cocultures to adherent susceptible cells, which become infected, express viral proteins, and fuse into multinucleated syncytia several days later. PBMCs from 3 of 10 BLV-infected sheep displayed a lifelong deficiency in induction of syncytium formation among indicator cells in culture, although large numbers of PBMCs synthesized viral transcripts or capsid protein. Since the infected, syncytium-deficient PBMCs were > or = 97% B cells, the deficiency could not be attributed to altered host cell tropism. The syncytium-deficient phenotype was recapitulated in newly infected sheep, demonstrating that this property is regulated by the viral genotype. The alteration in the BLV genome delayed but did not prohibit the establishment of BLV infection in vivo. Envelope glycoproteins were synthesized in syncytium-deficient PBMCs, translocated to the cell surface, and incorporated into virions. However, monoclonal antibodies specific for the BLV surface glycoprotein did not stain fixed PBMCs of the syncytium-deficient phenotype. Moreover, an animal with syncytium-deficient PBMCs had lower titers of neutralizing antibodies throughout the first 5 years of infection than an animal with similar numbers of infected PBMCs of the syncytium-inducing phenotype. The syncytium-deficient variant productively infected indicator cells at greatly reduced efficiency, showing that the alteration affects an early step in viral entry or replication.

This suggests that Vif either acts on another viral protein or is itself incorporated into particles. In this study, we have examined the latter possibility. We confirm our previous observation that Vif is incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions at a ratio of approximately 1 molecule of Vif for every 75 to 220 molecules of p24, or 7 to 20 molecules per virion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relative concentration of Vif is much lower in particles than in infected cells, whereas the opposite is observed for the main virus components. The viral envelope, Nef, Vpr, Vpu, protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase, nucleocapsid, and p6gag proteins as well as the viral genomic RNA are dispensable for Vif packaging. Furthermore, mutating several highly conserved residues (H-108, C-114, C-133, L-145, and Q-146) or deleting the C-terminal 18 amino acids of Vif, either of which severely impairs Vif function, does not abolish its incorporation into virions. Finally, Vif can be packaged into murine leukemia virus particles. On the basis of these data, we conclude that the specificity of Vif incorporation into virions remains an open question.","['Camaur, D', 'Trono, D']","['Camaur D', 'Trono D']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Gene Products, vif/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Virion/physiology', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.9.6106-6111.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Sep;70(9):6106-11. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.9.6106-6111.1996.,PMC190632,"['0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",['AI32349/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the requirements of the individual E-boxes in MLV transcriptional regulation. In lymphoid cell lines only, the E(gre)-binding protein complexes included ALF1 or HEB and E2A basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Ectopic ALF1 and E2A proteins required intact E(gre) motifs for mediating transcriptional activation. ALF1 transactivated transcription of Akv MLV through the two E(gre) motifs equally, whereas E2A protein required the promoter-proximal E(gre) motif. In T- and B-cell lines, the E(gre) motifs were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity, while the EA/S motif had some effect. In contrast, neither E(gre) nor EA/S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells lacking DNA-binding ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins. The Id1 protein was found to repress ALF1 activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ectopic Id1 repressed E(gre)-directed but not EA/S-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines.

In the course of virus assembly, NCp10 is necessary for core formation, and the zinc finger flanked by the basic residues is required for the packaging of the genomic RNA dimer. In vitro, NCp10 exhibits strong nucleic acid binding and annealing activities that appear to be critical for virus infectivity since NCp10 promotes dimerization of the viral RNA containing the E/DLS packaging-dimerization signal and annealing of replication primer tRNA(Pro) to the initiation site of reverse transcription (PBS). Recent in vitro studies have suggested that NCp10 may also play a role in proviral DNA synthesis. To investigate the function of NCp10 in proviral DNA synthesis in vivo, we developed a simple and convenient genetic packaging system consisting of two DNA constructs expressing the packaging components gag-pol and env of Friend MuLV and a Moloney MuLV-based lacZ vector with either the MuLV E+ or a rat VL30 E packaging signal. This system allowed us to examine the consequences of a set of mutations in NCp10 on a single round of recombinant virus replication. Most mutations in the N- or C-terminal domain of NCp10 do not significantly alter infectivity, while those in the zinc finger drastically impair infectivity. Analysis of the viral RNA content in virions showed that all mutations in the zinc finger decrease but do not abolish packaging of the recombinant genome. Interestingly enough, mutation of Y-28 to S (mutation Y28S) in the zinc finger results in RNA packaging at a level similar to that observed upon deletion of three prolines and three arginines in the C-terminal domain of NCp10 (mutant delta PR3). However, mutant Y28S is noninfectious while mutant delta PR3 is only threefold less infectious than the wild-type virus, which prompted us to examine the role of NCp10 protein in proviral DNA synthesis in vivo using these nucleocapsid mutants. PCR amplification was used to analyze viral DNA synthesized in newly infected cells, and results indicate that the Y28S zinc finger mutation impairs reverse transcription, thus suggesting that the nucleocapsid protein zinc finger plays a key role in proviral DNA synthesis in vivo.","['Yu, Q', 'Darlix, J L']","['Yu Q', 'Darlix JL']","['LaboRetro, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA Replication', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, env', '*Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication', '*Zinc Fingers']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.9.5791-5798.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Sep;70(9):5791-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.9.5791-5798.1996.,PMC190593,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore compared the direct antileukemic activities of these compounds in stroma-supported cultures of leukemic lymphoblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from children with B-lineage ALL were cultured on allogeneic bone marrow-derived stromal layers and exposed to various concentrations of glucocorticoids. After 4 days of culture, the number of viable leukemic cells was counted by flow cytometry and compared with that in parallel cultures without drugs. RESULTS: In 28 B-lineage ALL samples tested, the concentration producing 50% cytotoxicity (LC50) of prednisolone ranged from 2.0 to 7,978 nmol/L (median, 43.5 nmol/L), and that of dexamethasone from 0.6 to 327 nmol/L (median, 7.5 nmol/L). Despite the wide variability of responses among samples, there was an excellent correlation between LC50 values obtained with the two drugs (linear r = .99, P < .0001; Spearman rank-order r = .77, P < .0001). The median ratio of dexamethasone to prednisolone LC50 and LC90 values was 1:5.5 (range, 1:1.0 to 1:24.4 for LC50; 1:1.1 to 1:25.5 for LC90). Studies with ALL cell lines demonstrated that both drugs were cytotoxic through induction of apoptosis. Stromal layers did not absorb or inactivate measurable amounts of corticosteroids, which indicates that the assay system did not bias results toward increased drug resistance. CONCLUSION: In a bone marrow-derived microenvironment, dexamethasone is five to six times more cytotoxic (on a molar basis) than prednisolone, in agreement with the antiinflammatory activities of these drugs. This finding may serve to guide the selection of dexamethasone dosage in the treatment of ALL.","['Ito, C', 'Evans, W E', 'McNinch, L', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Pui, C H', 'Campana, D']","['Ito C', 'Evans WE', 'McNinch L', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Mahmoud H', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.8.2370 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Aug;14(8):2370-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.8.2370.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']","['P01-CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive adult patients with AML in first complete remission (CR) were treated with HD Ara-C consolidation therapy as a method of in vivo purging before marrow collection. High-dose therapy consisted of fractionated total-body irradiation (FTBI) 12 Gy, intravenous etoposide 60 mg/kg, and cyclophosphamide 75 mg/kg, followed by reinfusion of cryopreserved marrow. RESULTS: Sixty patients underwent consolidation treatment with HD Ara-C with the intent to treat with autologous BMT. Sixteen patients were unable to proceed to autologous BMT (10 patients relapsed, one died of sepsis, one developed cerebellar toxicity, two had inadequate blood counts, and two refused). Forty-four patients underwent autologous BMT and have a median follow-up time of 37 months (range, 14.7 to 68.7) for patients who are alive with no relapse. The cumulative probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 24 months in the intent-to-treat group is 49% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37% to 62%) and in those who actually underwent autologous BMT is 61% (95% CI, 46% to 74%). The probability of relapse was 44% (95% CI, 31% to 58%) and 33% (95% CI, 20% to 49%) for the intent-to-treat and autologous BMT patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: This approach offers a relatively high DFS rate to adult patients with AML in first CR. The results of this study are similar to those achieved with allogeneic BMT.","['Stein, A S', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Chai, A', 'Schmidt, G M', 'Nademanee, A', 'Parker, P M', 'Smith, E P', 'Snyder, D S', 'Molina, A', 'Stepan, D E', 'Spielberger, R', 'Somlo, G', 'Margolin, K A', 'Vora, N', 'Lipsett, J', 'Lee, J', 'Niland, J', 'Forman, S J']","['Stein AS', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Chai A', 'Schmidt GM', 'Nademanee A', 'Parker PM', 'Smith EP', 'Snyder DS', 'Molina A', 'Stepan DE', 'Spielberger R', 'Somlo G', 'Margolin KA', 'Vora N', 'Lipsett J', 'Lee J', 'Niland J', 'Forman SJ']","['Department of Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.

HTLV-I seroconversion may not take place for many years after infection and some patients develop relatively low concentrations of antibodies that are difficult to detect by means of conventional assays. Some serologic tests also yield high rates of false-positive results. We therefore decided to determine whether the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) might be more sensitive than serology for the diagnosis of HTLV-I infection. Samples of serum and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 50 patients with spastic myelopathy and nine with T-cell neoplasia. The serum samples of serum were tested for the presence of HTLV-I antibodies by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive results were confirmed by Western blot (WB) assay. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a PCR performed by use of two primer pairs from the env and pol regions of the proviral genome. Seven of the 50 patients with myelopathy and none of those with T-cell neoplasia had detectable antibodies to HTLV-I and all seven were PCR positive. One patient with an indeterminate WB result and one who was HTLV-I antibody-negative, both with myelopathy, were also PCR-positive. In this study, PCR was found to be more sensitive than serology for the diagnosis of HTLV-I infection. PCR should therefore be considered for selected HTLV-I antibody-negative patients with unexplained spastic myelopathy or T-cell neoplasia.","['van der Ryst, E', 'Smith, M S', 'Visagie, H M']","['van der Ryst E', 'Smith MS', 'Visagie HM']","['Department of Virology, University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/diagnosis', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serologic Tests']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-4453(96)91219-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0163-4453(96)91219-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect. 1996 Mar;32(2):109-12. doi: 10.1016/s0163-4453(96)91219-0.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine cells were splenic erythroblasts from animals infected with the anemia strain of Friend virus (FVA cells). In FVA cells cultured without EPO, the c-myc mRNA and protein levels decrease sharply within 3 to 4 h, showing that continual EPO stimulation is required to maintain c-myc expression. When cultured with EPO, the c-myc mRNA level of FVA cells is raised within 30 min of exposure. The c-myc mRNA and protein reach maxima at 1 to 3 h, then decline slowly to very low levels by 18 h. In contrast, c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels are not regulated by EPO in FVA cells. The human cells analyzed were colony-forming units-erythroid, CFU-E, derived in vitro by the culture of peripheral blood burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E). When grown in EPO and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) these cells differentiate into reticulocytes over 6 days rather than the 2 days required for murine cells, but the c-myc mRNA kinetics and response to EPO parallel those of mouse cells at similar stages of differentiation. Both IGF-1 and c-kit ligand (SCF) cause an additive increase in c-myc mRNA in human CFU-E in conjunction with EPO. These additive effects suggest that EPO, IGF-1, and SCF affect c-myc mRNA accumulation by distinct mechanisms. Addition of an antisense oligonucleotide to c-myc in cultures of human CFU-E specifically inhibited cell proliferation but did not affect erythroid cell differentiation or apoptosis. When human cells were grown in high SCF concentrations, an environment which enhances proliferation and retards differentiation, antisense oligonucleotide to c-myc strongly inhibited proliferation, but such inhibition did not induce differentiation. This latter result indicates that differentiation requires signals other than depression of c-Myc and resultant depression of proliferation.","['Bondurant, M C', 'Yamashita, T', 'Muta, K', 'Krantz, S B', 'Koury, M J']","['Bondurant MC', 'Yamashita T', 'Muta K', 'Krantz SB', 'Koury MJ']","['Department of Medicine, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199608)168:2<255::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199608)168:2<255::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-O [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Aug;168(2):255-63. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199608)168:2<255::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-O.,,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']","['DK-15555/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

LTR-env-gene-spliced mRNA of 9 and 3.5 Kb is widely expressed in human tissues and cells, but gag-pol mRNA has not been found. Further, the env gp70 gene contains an open reading frame throughout its length and its expression has recently been detected as a full-length protein. The highest expression of ERV3 detected so far is in placenta and the lowest in cytotrophoblasts and choriocarcinoma cell lines. In this report we have studied ERV3 mRNA and protein expression in the human monoblastic cell line U-937 during differentiation into monocytes/macrophages. Differentiation of U-937 cells was induced by 1,25a-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitD3), retinoic acid (RA), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA-TPA). The expression of ERV3 env mRNA was found to be differentiation-associated, with high expression detected in the late stages of monocytic development. Using TPA, the expression of ERV3 env was detected as 9- and 3.5-kb transcripts by Northern blotting, as mRNA by in situ hybridization and as a cytoplasmic 65-kDa protein by immunofluorescence and Western blots. Low levels of basal expression were found, with up-regulation of both message and protein at 24 to 48 hr after addition of TPA. Induction with vitD3, IFN-gamma and RA produced higher levels of mRNA at earlier time points. It is concluded that the U-937 cell line represents an excellent model system for further studies to study the relationship between ERV3 expression and cellular differentiation.","['Larsson, E', 'Venables, P J', 'Andersson, A C', 'Fan, W', 'Rigby, S', 'Botling, J', 'Oberg, F', 'Cohen, M', 'Nilsson, K']","['Larsson E', 'Venables PJ', 'Andersson AC', 'Fan W', 'Rigby S', 'Botling J', 'Oberg F', 'Cohen M', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/*cytology/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/29 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/29 00:00'],"['1996/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<451::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<451::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jul 29;67(3):451-6. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<451::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-9.,,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined here whether MRK-16 can enhance MDR reversal activity of PSC833. We found that MRK-16 potentiated the MDR reversal activity of PSC833, and of CsA, in MDR sublines of human myelocytic leukemia K562 and human ovarian cancer A2780 cells. Like MRK-16 combined with CsA, MRK-16 enhanced the effect of a sub-optimum dose of PSC833 on vincristine accumulation in MDR cells. However, MRK-16 could not increase cellular accumulation of PSC833 in MDR tumor cells, yet it could increase cellular accumulation of CsA. P-glycoprotein could not transport PSC833 but could transport CsA. Our results indicate that MRK-16 potentiates the MDR reversal activity of both PSC833 and CsA, yet also suggest that the molecular mechanism of the potentiation differs between the two substances.","['Naito, M', 'Watanabe, T', 'Tsuge, H', 'Koyama, T', 'Oh-hara, T', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Naito M', 'Watanabe T', 'Tsuge H', 'Koyama T', 'Oh-hara T', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*immunology', 'Affinity Labels', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1996/07/29 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/29 00:00'],"['1996/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<435::AID-IJC20>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<435::AID-IJC20>3.0.CO;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jul 29;67(3):435-40. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<435::AID-IJC20>3.0.CO;2-5.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to restore p53, we evaluated in vitro infectivity and cytotoxicity of a wild type (w.t.) p53-expressing adenovirus (Ad-p53) toward a panel of human cancer cell lines (n = 19). At a multiplicity of infection of 30, both Ad-p53 and adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) infected greater than 99% of cells derived from brain, lung, breast, ovarian, colon, and prostate cancer, but failed to infect leukemia or lymphoma cells. Ad-p53, but not Ad-LacZ, infection of cancer cells was followed by nuclear accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p21WAFI/CIPI, cell cycle arrest and loss of viability. Ad-p53 induced apoptotic death in cancer cells that express mutant p53, including multi-drug resistant cells, but fewer deaths were observed in some w.t. p53 expressing cells. Ad-p53-infected SKBr3 breast cancer cells were more sensitive to cytotoxicity of the DNA damaging drugs mitomycin C or Adriamycin, but not the M-phase specific drug vincristine. Our results suggest that Ad-p53 is capable of infecting and killing cancer cells of diverse tissue origins (including multi-drug resistant cancer cells), that p21WAFI/CIPI may be a useful marker of p53 infectivity and that there may be synergy between Ad-p53 and either mitomycin C or Adriamycin induced cell death in tumors with p53 mutations.","['Blagosklonny, M V', 'el-Deiry, W S']","['Blagosklonny MV', 'el-Deiry WS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Cell Cycle Regulation, University of Pennsylvania Comprehensive Cancer Center, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenovirus Infections, Human/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/therapy/virology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/therapy/virology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Genes, p53', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/therapy/virology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/therapy/virology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy/*virology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",1996/07/29 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/29 00:00'],"['1996/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<386::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<386::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jul 29;67(3):386-92. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960729)67:3<386::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-6.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies show that uPAR itself is a high-affinity adhesion receptor for vitronectin and that urokinase (uPA) is an activator of this adhesive function. In the course of exploring possible G-protein involvement in this adhesion it was observed that TGF-beta 1/D3-primed U937 cells became adhesive to vitronectin in an uPAR-dependent manner when exposed to pertussis toxin (PTX). The adherent response is concentration- and time-dependent, and was not due to the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin because the purified B-subunit of PTX was equally effective. Although promoting adhesion to serum- or vitronectin-coated surfaces, PTX blocked spontaneous cell adhesion to fibrinogen, an endogenous ligand for the Mac-1 receptor (CD11b/CD18). Flow cytometry study showed that expression of the alpha-subunit of Mac-1 (CD11b) on primed cells was increased by nearly threefold. Monoclonal antibody to CD11b abolished the PTX-induced cell adhesion and the binding of the primed cells to PTX-coated plates. Activation of Mac-1 receptor by its endogenous ligand fibrinogen induced cell adherent response similar to PTX. PTX, but not uPA, triggered a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i in primed U937 cells, and PTX-induced adhesion was significantly attenuated by 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/acetoxy-methyl ester (BAPTA/AM), a selective membrane-permeant [Ca2+]i chelator. PTX-induced cell adhesion was also prevented by antibodies to uPAR and by conditioned medium containing soluble uPAR. Together these data indicate that PTX B-subunit may bind to Mac-1 integrin, which leads to a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i and subsequent activation of uPAR for adherence to vitronectin, suggesting a functional link between Mac-1 and activation of uPAR important to cellular trafficking and host defence in response to Bordetella pertussis infection.","['Wong, W S', 'Simon, D I', 'Rosoff, P M', 'Rao, N K', 'Chapman, H A']","['Wong WS', 'Simon DI', 'Rosoff PM', 'Rao NK', 'Chapman HA']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/immunology/*physiology', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Plasminogen Activators/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology', 'Vitronectin/*metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1996.d01-646.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 1996 May;88(1):90-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1996.d01-646.x.,PMC1456468,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (Vitronectin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['GM41076/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-44712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'L02768/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The two most common opportunistic fungal infections seen today are caused by Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. Systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients have an extremely high mortality and require aggressive therapy. Skill in identifying early clinical features is therefore crucial and the multifaceted role of the nurse is of major importance in the management of at-risk patients. Nurses are the key resource in the prevention, early detection and treatment of fungal infection. All neutropenic patients should be thoroughly assessed at least twice a day, with special attention given to the most frequent sites of infection-the oral mucosa, lungs, skin, venepuncture sites and perineal area. Although fever is the hallmark of infection, it may be absent in the neutropenic patient who is unable to mount an adequate inflammatory response. It may also be masked by the use of certain drugs, such as steroids or analgesics. When systemic fungal infection is suspected, seriously ill patients require immediate antifungal therapy. Amphotericin B is currently the only agent with a sufficiently broad spectrum of activity to cover all the most common pathogens. Although conventional amphotericin B is effective, however, the required doses often carry significant toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity. The new, lipid-based forms of amphotericin B, such as Abelcet, are indicated for and have been shown to be effective in patients with severe systemic and/or deep mycoses in whom conventional amphotericin B has proven ineffective or is contraindicated because of renal impairment, and in patients who have failed to respond to other antifungal agents.","['Antrum, J']",['Antrum J'],"['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol Suppl,European journal of haematology.

To determine whether, among individuals who develop cancers, some may have been more susceptible to the mutagenic effects of environmental agents, skin biopsies were taken from 79 cancer patients with different common types of cancers (e.g., lung, breast, bladder, colon, cervix, ovary, brain, vocal cord, uterus, skin, testis, stomach, basal cell carcinoma, leukemia, etc.). Fibroblast cultures have been established from skin explants from nearly all of the patients. The sensitivity of some of these cells as well as a number of other fibroblast strains established from ""clinically normal"" individuals to a battery of mutagenic agents (e.g., ethylmethane sulfonate, methylmethane sulfonate, ethidium bromide, actinomycin D, mitomycin C, bleomycin, camptothecin), which induce different kinds of DNA damage was examined. For the control group of fibroblasts, a normal range of toxicity for all of the above agents have been established. In contrast to other mutagens for which sensitivity of all of the control cell strains lay within a narrow range, large and interesting differences in sensitivity were observed for ethidium bromide. The fibroblast strains established from fetal tissue were found to be highly resistant to ethidium bromide, whereas fibroblasts from two clinically normal persons exhibited greatly enhanced sensitivity to this agent. The genetic or biochemical basis of increased sensitivity or resistance to ethidium bromide remains to be determined. The sensitivity of cells from 28 cancer patients to a number of the mutagenic agents was also examined. Most of these strains exhibited normal range of sensitivity to the mutagens; however, a few showed small but noticeable differences in sensitivity to specific agents. The fibroblast strains from cancer patients provide a useful resource to examine the genetic and metabolic factors that may be important determinants in cancer susceptibility.","['Gupta, R S', 'Gupta, R', 'Goldstein, S']","['Gupta RS', 'Gupta R', 'Goldstein S']","['Department of Biochemistry, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Gerontol,Experimental gerontology,0047061,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0531-5565(95)00023-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0531-5565(95)00023-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Gerontol. 1996 Jan-Apr;31(1-2):267-80. doi: 10.1016/0531-5565(95)00023-2.,,['0 (Mutagens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the cDNA cloning and characterization of the antigen recognized by the 6C6 mAb. The isolated cDNA clone encodes a protein of 246 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 27 991 Da. The protein contains three amino-terminal hydrophobic regions, which could represent transmembrane domains, and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region, which we show to be extracellular. The identity of the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA as the 6C6 antigen was confirmed by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation experiments, and by transfection into cell lines that do not react with the 6C6 mAb, which resulted in the expression of a 28-kDa surface protein that was recognized by the antibody. The 6C6 antigen appears to be a type II transmembrane protein, with multiple membrane-spanning domains and a long extracellular non-glycosylated carboxy-terminal domain, to which the 6C6 epitope has been mapped. The overall structure of the protein and weak amino acid similarities with a family of multiple-transmembrane-spanning-domain proteins that includes some antigens (such as L6, CD63/ME491 and CO-029) that are overexpressed in tumor cells, suggest that the 6C6 antigen may belong to this family of proteins.","['Li, E', 'Bestagno, M', 'Burrone, O']","['Li E', 'Bestagno M', 'Burrone O']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Area Science Park, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0631w.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Jun 15;238(3):631-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0631w.x.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (BCAP31 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,['GENBANK/X81109'],,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that IL-11 and LIF induced only minimal stimulation on production of APP by human primary hepatocytes compared with IL-6, known as the major inducer. Serum levels of CRP were elevated in RA and SpA, and significantly higher than in SLE patients. Despite the presence of a high APP response in some of our patients and despite the fact that we used sensitive assays to measure IL-11 and LIF, serum levels of both cytokines were not detected in any of the tested sera.

In contrast, induced differentiation of murine p19 embryonal carcinoma and Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells did not result in a loss of telomerase activity. These results are therefore consistent with the absence of telomerase activity in human somatic cells and the presence of telomerase activity in many somatic murine cells and tissues.","['Bestilny, L J', 'Brown, C B', 'Miura, Y', 'Robertson, L D', 'Riabowol, K T']","['Bestilny LJ', 'Brown CB', 'Miura Y', 'Robertson LD', 'Riabowol KT']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Aug 15;56(16):3796-802.,,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

E-MuLV expression was intensely inhibited in F1 hybrids with the strains either with the Fv-1b allele (BALB/C, C57BL/10, and A/J) or with the Fv-1nr allele (NZB). In these F1 mice, no lymphoma developed by 18 months of age. On the other hand, F1 hybrids with the strains with the Fv-1n allele [C3H/He, CBA/N, SJL, DBA/2, and MSM/Ms (hereafter referred to as MSM)], high or intermediate levels of E-MuLV expression were observed. Lymphoma incidence in these F1 hybrids, however, was low. This observation suggests the presence of non-Fv-1 dominant resistance genes in these strains. In an attempt to characterize such host genes, we analyzed crosses between SL/Kh mice and a wild mouse-derived inbred strain, MSM/Ms. The latter was susceptible to N-tropic virus expression, but (SL/Kh x MSM)F1 hybrids, did not develop and lymphomas. Of 60 SL/Kh x (SL/Kh x MSM)F1 hybrids, 14 B-lineage lymphomas, including 13 pre-B and 1 follicular center cell lymphoma, developed by 18 months of age. This was compatible with the hypothesis of two independently segregating dominant genes of MSM suppressing lymphomagenesis. By scanning all chromosomes for linkage of lymphoma susceptibility with polymorphic microsatellite loci, one significant linkage disequilibrium was found in the proximal segment of chromosome 17, containing D17MIT44 (map position 15.0) to D17MIT150 (position 33.3), and another linkage disequilibrium, in the midproximal segment of chromosome 18, containing D18MIT90 (map position 28.0) and D18MIT140 (37.0). All 13 pre-B lymphoma-bearing backcross mice were homozygous for SL/Kh-derived alleles at these loci.

However, its role in the neuroendocrine system is relatively unexplored, with the exception of one report indicating that LIF may act to determine the unique vascular organization of the pituitary gland. In the present study the expression of LIF mRNA has been demonstrated for the first time in the pituitary gland of the rat, in all three pituitary lobes. However, LIF gene expression is restricted to tissues in explant culture where LIF transcripts are readily detectable by Northern Techniques. Similar studies using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique also failed to detect LIF transcripts in fresh tissue from adult animals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LIF acts to mediate the response to trauma, a response that may include the induction of neuropeptide expression in the anterior pituitary. In further studies it has also been shown that anterior pituitary LIF mRNA is super-induced in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, a response that indicates a role for a labile protein in the attenuation of LIF expression. Both the explantation response, and the response to protein synthesis inhibitory drugs are decreased in the presence of dexamethasone indicating that a glucocorticoid receptor mechanism acts as a general modulatory influence on LIF mRNA levels. These findings are consistent with the presence of multiple regulatory controls on the expression of LIF that serve to restrict its expression to pathological conditions, and indicate that LIF does not participate in normal endocrine physiology.","['Carter, D A']",['Carter DA'],"['Physiology Unit, School of Molecular and Medical Biosciences, University of Wales, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neuroendocrinol,Journal of neuroendocrinology,8913461,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2826.1995.tb00800.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuroendocrinol. 1995 Aug;7(8):623-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2826.1995.tb00800.x.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease-free survival at 10 years was 73% in children receiving allo-BMT in 1CR, 50% in the matched controls (P = 0.02), and 59% in the remaining HR-ALL patients. The good prognosis of the allo-BMT group was due to a low relapse rate of 9%, as opposed to 41% in the group of matched controls. The superiority of allo-BMT as therapy in 1CR was mainly apparent in those with a very high WBC of > or = 100 x 10(9)/I at diagnosis; in the allo-BMT group 9/10 survived, as opposed to 8/20 of the matched controls (P = 0.03).

The purpose of this study was to determine whether administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) early after ABMT might induce or exacerbate acute skin GVHD. Fourteen patients at high risk for post-transplant relapse, eight with NHL and six with AML > or = first relapse, were conditioned with chemotherapy and total body irradiation (13) or chemotherapy alone (1), and received purged (10) or unpurged (4) marrow. A median of 35 days (range 25-58) after ABMT, they received a 5-day induction course of Roche IL-2 (9 x 10(6) U/m2/day) followed by apheresis, reinfusion of LAK cells, and a 10-day maintenance course of IL-2 (0.9 x 10(6) U/m2/day), all by continuous i.v. infusion. Serial skin biopsies were obtained before and after IL-2 therapy and were read blindly. Patients were studied prospectively for the development of acute cutaneous GVHD as reflected by rash ( > or = 25% body surface area), skin biopsy ( > or = grade II histologic changes) and T cell infiltration as assessed by staining of the biopsy with antibodies UCHL-1 and TIA-1. No patient had a rash before IL-2 therapy, but 12 of 14 (85%) developed a rash during the IL-2 induction course. Before IL-2 therapy, biopsies from three of 10 patients (30%) revealed histologic GVHD; after induction IL-2, biopsies from 11 of 14 patients (79%) revealed grade II acute GVHD. Biopsies from all patients with histologic GVHD after IL-2 therapy contained TIA-1 positive T cells. HLA-DR was negative in the keratinocytes of these paraffin-embedded sections. One patient died early of sepsis, one patient required and responded to topical corticosteroids and 12 had spontaneous resolution of the rash. Six patients relapsed at 3-13 months, while seven remain in complete remission 32+ to 41+ months after ABMT. The results demonstrate that IL-2 therapy after ABMT can induce effects which histologically and clinically mimic cutaneous acute GVHD in most patients. Prospective, randomized trials of IL-2 vs observation after transplantation of autologous marrow or stem cells for high-risk NHL and AML have been initiated which may allow us to determine whether this phenomenon is associated with a clinical GVL effect as reflected by a decreased relapse rate.","['Massumoto, C', 'Benyunes, M C', 'Sale, G', 'Beauchamp, M', 'York, A', 'Thompson, J A', 'Buckner, C D', 'Fefer, A']","['Massumoto C', 'Benyunes MC', 'Sale G', 'Beauchamp M', 'York A', 'Thompson JA', 'Buckner CD', 'Fefer A']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Mar;17(3):351-6.,,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase II study was carried out in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies receiving allogeneic transplants without improvement in outcome as compared to historical controls. In that study, steady-state concentration (Css) of BU in 13 patients receiving a fixed dose of BU varied from 209 to 735 ng/ml. In an attempt to decrease the variability of the Css of BU, a study of targeting specific plasma concentrations was performed. In this study, BU dose was adjusted up or down based on first dose pharmacokinetics. The first dose level evaluated was 7.5 mg/kg with a target BU plasma level of 460 ng/ml. Six patients were entered at this level and the median BU plasma concentration achieved was 410 (range 390-533). One of six patients developed grade 3-4 regimen-related toxicities (RRT). Dose level II was a target of 559 ng/ml with a starting oral dose of BU of 9.6 mg/kg. Twelve patients were entered at this level and median plasma BU level was 548 (range 427-689). Three of 12 (25%) patients developed grade 3-4 RRTs and this was considered to be the MTD. The actuarial probability of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 0.70. Eight of 21 evaluable patients (38%) developed chronic GVHD. Of 18 patients who died, seven died of relapse at a median of 160 days (range 65-353) and 11 (61%) died of causes other than relapse at a median of 152 days (range 18-570). The actuarial probabilities of DFS, relapse and relapse-free mortality at 2 years in all patients were 0.13, 0.50 and 0.75, respectively. This study showed that targeted BU plasma levels within 10% of target can reliably be achieved with a bias of -2.07% and mean absolute error of 7.47%. Overall, targeting made a -31.8% to 100% in plasma BU Css as compared to expected BU Css based on first dose pharmacokinetics if targeting were not performed in this study. Thus targeting avoided much of the variability in BU concentrations seen in other studies. When compared with our previous phase II experience in same group of patients receiving same regimen, dose escalation of BU based on targeted plasma levels did not improve the outcome.","['Demirer, T', 'Buckner, C D', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Lambert, K', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Clift, R', 'Storb, R', 'Slattery, J T']","['Demirer T', 'Buckner CD', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Lambert K', 'Bensinger WI', 'Clift R', 'Storb R', 'Slattery JT']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Mar;17(3):341-6.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']","['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We measured baseline and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated NK cell cytotoxicity, as well as expression of IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) (alpha-chain (p55) and beta-chain (p75)), and adhesion molecules. The cytotoxic activity of PB NK cells was significantly lower in autologous transplant patients than in normal donors (P < 0.0005) and this difference was not mitigated following IL-2 activation. In contrast, BM from autologous patients showed normal NK cell cytotoxicity, but contained higher numbers of NK cells (P < 0.025), with more intense CD56 expression (P < 0.05). Expression of p75 was lower on BM than on PB NK cells in both patients and normal donors. In addition, induction of p55 by IL-2 was abrogated in autologous PB NK cells. Therefore, depending on the site of harvest and the nature of donor cells (pre-BMT vs normal), our results show significant differences in NK cell number, function, and IL-2 receptor expression. This may affect relapse rates following autologous transplants performed with either PB or BM grafts.","['Arbour, S', 'Toupin, S', 'Belanger, R', 'Gyger, M', 'Halle, J P', 'Perreault, C', 'Roy, D C']","['Arbour S', 'Toupin S', 'Belanger R', 'Gyger M', 'Halle JP', 'Perreault C', 'Roy DC']","['Division of Hematology-Immunology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/blood', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Mar;17(3):315-22.,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To establish a rapid and sensitive method to detect neoplastic cells carrying a specific chromosomal translocation, we have developed a novel strategy based on long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) amplification. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor cells carrying t(14;19)(q32;q13), t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(3;22)(q27;q11), t(2;3)(p12;q27), or t(3;14)(q27;q32). Thirty-two to 35-mer oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to be complementary to exons or flanking sequences of the BCL3, c-MYC and BCL6 oncogenes, and to IG constant region genes. LD-PCR with a newly available Taq polymerase for longer product synthesis successfully amplified fragments representing BCL3/C alpha junctional sequences for t(14;19); c-MYC/C mu, c-MYC/C gamma, and c-MYC/C alpha for t(8;14); BCL6/C lambda for t(3;22); BCL6/C kappa for t(2;3); 5'-BCL6/C mu, and 5'-BCL6/C gamma for t(3;14). In Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia, all materials in which c-MYC rearrangements were detectable by conventional Southern blot hybridization showed positive LD-PCR amplification. The sizes of the amplified fragments varied from 1.8 kb to 12 kb, and these were specific to each material. Serial dilution of tumor cells or DNA in negative materials demonstrated a single band on agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide at a level of sensitivity of 10(-3), and hybridization with radioactive probe improved the level by one order of magnitude (1 cell in 10(4)), indicating that this LD-PCR approach is a sensitive technique capable of detecting minimal residual disease. Thus, the present study provided a useful tool for diagnosis and subsequent management of B-cell neoplasms characterized by specific chromosomal translocations.","['Akasaka, T', 'Muramatsu, M', 'Ohno, H', 'Miura, I', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Fukuhara, S', 'Mori, T', 'Okuma, M']","['Akasaka T', 'Muramatsu M', 'Ohno H', 'Miura I', 'Tatsumi E', 'Fukuhara S', 'Mori T', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, myc', 'Herpesviridae Infections/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/pathology/virology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62525-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):985-94.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work was to establish an ability to measure the extent to which melphalan reacts with the DNA of individual tumor cells, thereby creating new possibilities for molecular pharmacological studies on clinical samples. A novel approach for staining drug-DNA adducts is described in which cells were embedded in agarose and then lysed. The DNA from each cell remained in an ideal state for quantitative immunofluorescent staining using a previously described monoclonal antibody. Immunofluorescence and DNA-Hoechst dye fluorescence were quantified using a cooled slow scan charge coupled device camera and image analysis procedures. Immunofluorescence of drug-treated cells from a human leukemia cell line was partially correlated with DNA content. Mean integrated immunofluorescence of 50 to 100 cells was dependent on drug concentration and was linearly related to adduct levels. In these cells and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells obtained from patients, there was considerable intercell heterogeneity in apparent adduct levels.

Although LIF alone or in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) has no effect on colony formation of unfractionated bone marrow cells (BMCs), it enhances M-CSF-induced colony formation. In comparison, LIF synergizes with IL-3, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and Steel Factor (SLF) to promote the colony formation of partially purified lineage-negative (Lin-) BM progenitors without altering their differentiation. These effects were directly mediated since identical results were observed in single-cell assays. Comparing the effect of LIF with other members of this subclass of hematopoietins (IL-6, oncostatin M [OSM], and ciliary neurotrophic factor [CNTF]), we found that while LIF and IL-6 equally synergize with M-CSF and SLF to promote the colony formation of Lin- BMCs, OSM, and CNTF have no effect. In agreement with OSMs ability to directly bind gp130, preincubation of BMCs with OSM inhibits progenitor cell growth stimulated by the combination of LIF or IL-6 plus SLF. LIF can also directly enhance the growth of further purified more primitive Lin- c-kit+ progenitor cells in the presence of IL-3, GM-CSF, or SLF. Thus, LIF can directly synergize with growth factors to promote the proliferation of purified hematopoietic progenitors, suggesting that the direct effects of LIF on hematopoietic cell growth can, in part, explain the observed hematopoietic effects in vivo.

We transfected a -116 nt construct containing a deletion of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) or mutation in the serum response element (SRE) and demonstrated that both the SRE and CRE are necessary for maximal induction. However, PIXY321 stimulation resulted in 2.5-fold induction of a SRE-CRE-containing construct (P < .05), suggesting that the SRE and CRE are sufficient for PIXY321 responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed that the CRE binding protein (CREB) was phosphorylated on serine 133 in PIXY321-stimulated but not -unstimulated extracts from cells cultured in GM-CSF. By Western analysis and EMSA, CREB was constitutively phosphorylated in TF-1 cells grown on PIXY321 before growth factor and serum starvation. However, in TF-1 cells grown on GM-CSF before starvation, CREB phosphorylation was observed 10 minutes after PIXY321 stimulation. Further-more, ENSAs with PIXY321-stimulated and -unstimulated extracts demonstrated the presence of specific proteins that recognize the SRE. Our data demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of egr-1 by PIXY321 is mediated by the CRE and SRE.","['Mignacca, R C', 'Lee, H J', 'Kwon, E M', 'Sakamoto, K M']","['Mignacca RC', 'Lee HJ', 'Kwon EM', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, Department of Pediatrics, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1752, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62507-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):848-54.,,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PIXY321 fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['1R55CA/OD68221-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59463/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the effectiveness and long-term complications of intensive rotational combination chemotherapy for late hematologic relapse (median, 16 months after elective cessation of therapy) among 34 children and young adults (ages 4 to 23 years). Concurrent central nervous system (CNS) relapse was present in 3 cases and testicular relapse in 4. Secondary therapy comprised an intensive five-drug reinduction (6 weeks) followed by continuation treatment with four drug pairs, rotated weekly in 4-week cycles over 120 weeks. Intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone, cytarabine) was given three times during reinduction and every 8 weeks during continuation. Treatment was electively discontinued at week 120 in the absence of detectable disease. Thirty-three patients (97%) attained a second complete remission. At a median follow-up of 9.3 years (range, 4.5 to 11.4), estimates of 5-year second event-free and overall survival (+/- SE) are 65% +/- 8% and 79% +/- 7%, respectively. Eleven patients had a second relapse (9 marrow, 2 testicular) and one developed secondary myeloid leukemia. There have been no CNS relapses or deaths in remission. Treatment was well-tolerated and was given largely on an outpatient basis. Late effects are primarily endocrinologic; one child had a second malignant solid tumor (presumed related to initial radiation therapy) that was treated successfully. Intensive treatment with alternating non-cross-resistant drug pairs for late hematologic relapses of ALL is effective and well-tolerated, and produces results similar to those achieved in patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Event-free survival compares favorably with reports of other relapse regimens, including those incorporating bone marrow transplantation.","['Rivera, G K', 'Hudson, M M', 'Liu, Q', 'Benaim, E', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Crist, W M', 'Pui, C H']","['Rivera GK', 'Hudson MM', 'Liu Q', 'Benaim E', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Crist WM', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Testis/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62505-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):831-7.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we report the constitutive nuclear localization, phosphorylation, and DNA-binding activity of STAT proteins in leukemia cells and lymphoma cell lines. With the use of oligonucleotide probes derived from the Fc gamma RI promoter, the beta-casein promoter and a STAT-binding element in the promoter of the Bci-2 gene constitutive activation of STAT proteins was detected in untreated acute T- and C/B-leukemia cells (3 of 5 and 12 of 19 patients, respectively). Supershift analyses using Stats 1-6 specific antisera showed the constitutive DNA binding activity of Stat5 in these cells. Confocal microscopy revealed the nuclear localization of Stat5 and Western blot analyses showed tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 in nuclear extracts of acute leukemia cells. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not display constitutive STAT-DNA interaction. Further studies were performed on freshly isolated acute myeloid leukemia cells as well as on cell line derived K562, lymphoblastoid cells (LCL), and Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL). Fluorescence microscopy, gelshift, and supershift experiments showed the nuclear localization and constitutive DNA-binding activity of Stat5 in K562 cells. Stat1 and Stat3 were constitutively activated in freshly isolated AML cells (10 of 14 patients) and in Epstein Barr virus-positive or interleukin-10 expressing permanent LCL and BL cells. Thus, these data indicate a differential pattern of STAT protein activation in lymphoid or myeloid leukemia and in lymphoma cells.","['Weber-Nordt, R M', 'Egen, C', 'Wehinger, J', 'Ludwig, W', 'Gouilleux-Gruart, V', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Finke, J']","['Weber-Nordt RM', 'Egen C', 'Wehinger J', 'Ludwig W', 'Gouilleux-Gruart V', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Finke J']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/virology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62502-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):809-16.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with leukemia, BM failure syndrome, or inborn error of metabolism were eligible for a phase I clinical trial designed to estimate the risk of graft failure and severe acute graft-versus-host disease after transplantation of umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors. As of December 21, 1995, unrelated donor umbilical cord blood was used to reconstitute hematopoiesis in eighteen patients aged 0.1 to 21.3 years weighing 3.3 to 78.8 kg with acquired or congenital lympho-hematopoietic disorders or metabolic disease. Patients received either HLA-matched (n = 7) or HLA-1 to 3 antigen disparate (n = 11) grafts collected and evaluated by the New York Blood Center (New York, NY). The probability of engraftment after unrelated donor umbilical cord blood transplantation was 100% with no patient having late graft failure to date. The probability of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease at 100 days was 11%. With a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 1.6 to 17 months); the probability of survival at 6 months is 65% in this high risk patient population. We conclude that cryopreserved umbilical cord blood from HLA-matched and mismatched unrelated donors is a sufficient source of transplantable hematopoietic stem cells with high probability of donor derived engraftment and low risk of refractory severe acute graft-versus-host disease. Limitations with regard to recipient size and degree of donor HLA disparity remain to be determined.","['Wagner, J E', 'Rosenthal, J', 'Sweetman, R', 'Shu, X O', 'Davies, S M', 'Ramsay, N K', 'McGlave, P B', 'Sender, L', 'Cairo, M S']","['Wagner JE', 'Rosenthal J', 'Sweetman R', 'Shu XO', 'Davies SM', 'Ramsay NK', 'McGlave PB', 'Sender L', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/mortality/therapy', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Preservation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/mortality/therapy', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62500-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):795-802.,,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],"['P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible to drastically reduce the T-cell content of the graft. However, transplanted T cells can also have a beneficial effect by graft enhancement and the graft-versus-leukemia effect. How can we keep the beneficial GVL effect while protecting the patient from possible GVHD? A recent report proposed the ex vivo transfer of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSv-tk) gene into donor T cells before their infusion with hematopoietic stem cells. This procedure is expected to allow selective donor T-cell depletion with ganciclovir should GVHD occur, but it has two major drawbacks: reinjection of a fraction of untransfected T cells cannot be avoided and heterogeneity of the transfected population results in increased risks such as HSv-tk gene instability or dysfunction of some of the transfected T cell. Alternative approaches must be considered. We demonstrate here the feasibility of generating HSv-tk transfected HLA-specific CD4+ cytotoxic T-cell clonal populations, in which 100% of the cells have the HSv-tk gene inserted at a single site within their genome.

In the present study, we report that heterologous expression of murine macrophage nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) in the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line results in constitutive production of nitric oxide associated with inhibition of hemoglobin expression. K562 cells were transfected with an episomally-maintained, hygromycin-selectable expression vector bearing the coding region of NOS-2. Constitutive NOS expression was detected by Western blotting of cell lysates and by the accumulation of nitrite in the culture media. Although NOS-transfected cells grew more slowly than control cells, they were able to maintain constitutive expression of NOS and production of nitric oxide for more than 1 month following transfection. The hemoglobin content of NOS-transfected K562 cells was less than one-fifth that of control cells, but increased markedly if NOS inhibitor was included in the culture media. The nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of hemoglobin expression was reversed by supplementing the culture media with 20 mumol/L hemin or 0.5 mmol/L 5-amino-levulinate, indicating that nitric oxide did not directly inhibit hemoglobin synthesis, but likely acted on a step in heme synthesis. mRNA levels for globin and erythroid aminolevulinic acid synthase (eALAS) were the same in both NOS-transfected and control cells. Our observations indicate that hemoglobin expression is inhibited by nitric oxide in NOS-transfected K562 cells by posttranscriptional repression of eALAS, the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. The most likely mechanism is a nitric oxide-mediated translational repression of eALAS, as was recently demonstrated for ferritin synthesis. These observations further illustrate the potential for endogenously produced nitric oxide to regulate cellular posttranscriptional events. In particular, our observations may be relevant to the role of nitric oxide in anemia and lowered blood hemoglobin concentrations that are associated with chronic infections, such as tuberculosis or parasitic disease.","['Rafferty, S P', 'Domachowske, J B', 'Malech, H L']","['Rafferty SP', 'Domachowske JB', 'Malech HL']","['Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heme/biosynthesis', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62535-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):1070-8.,,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

APL patients resistant to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and conventional chemotherapy can still respond to AS2O3. In this study, we addressed the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of this treatment by using NB4 cells as a model. The results show that: (1) As2O3 triggers relatively specific NB4 cell apoptosis at micromolar concentration, as proved by morphology, histogramic related nuclear DNA contents, and DNA gel eletrophoresis. (2) As2O3 does not influence bax, bcl-x, c-myc, and p53 gene expression, but downregulates bcl-2 gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels. (3) As2O3 induces a significant modulation of the PML staining pattern in NB4 cells and HL-60 cells. The micropunctates characteristic of PML-RAR alpha in NB4 cells dissappear after treatment with As2O3, whereas a diffuse PML staining occurs in the perinuclear cytoplasmic region. In addition, a low percentage of untreated NB4 cells exhibits an accumulation of PML positive particles in a compartment of cytoplasm. The percentage of these cells can be significantly increased after As2O3 treatment. A similar PML staining pattern is observed in apoptotic cells. (4) ATRA pretreatment does not influence As2O3-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that induction of cell apoptosis can be one of the mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of As2O3. Moreover, this apoptosis induction occurs independently of the retinoid pathway and may be mediated, at least partly, through the modulation of bcl-2, as well as PML-RAR alpha and/ or PML proteins.","['Chen, G Q', 'Zhu, J', 'Shi, X G', 'Ni, J H', 'Zhong, H J', 'Si, G Y', 'Jin, X L', 'Tang, W', 'Li, X S', 'Xong, S M', 'Shen, Z X', 'Sun, G L', 'Ma, J', 'Zhang, P', 'Zhang, T D', 'Gazin, C', 'Naoe, T', 'Chen, S J', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, Z']","['Chen GQ', 'Zhu J', 'Shi XG', 'Ni JH', 'Zhong HJ', 'Si GY', 'Jin XL', 'Tang W', 'Li XS', 'Xong SM', 'Shen ZX', 'Sun GL', 'Ma J', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang TD', 'Gazin C', 'Naoe T', 'Chen SJ', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Department of Biophysics, Shanghai Second Medical University, P.R.

Elevated IL-10 levels were observed in 33 of 45 patients with ATL. Fresh leukemic cells from ATL patients as well as HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines MT-2, SLB-1, and C10/MJ expressed IL-10 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, whereas IL-10 mRNA was not detected in normal peripheral mononuclear cells and an uninfected T-cell line Jurkat. IL-10 protein was also detected in the culture medium of leukemic cells from ATL patients as well as these HTLV-I-infected cell lines, and in the extracellular fluids of ATL patients. Interestingly, MT-4 cells, which did not express Tax although transformed by HTLV-I, did not express IL-10 at either the mRNA or protein level. To elucidate the role of the HTLV-I encoded transactivator Tax in IL-10 gene expression, Jurkat cells were transfected with a Tax expression plasmid. In transiently transfected Jurkat cells, endogenous IL-10 mRNA expression was induced by Tax. Stably transfected Jurkat cell lines expressed IL-10 mRNA and secreted IL-10 protein into the culture medium. The nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B pathway is a target for Tax transactivation. We treated MT-2 cells with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides to the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B. A reduction in the expression of p65 was accompanied by a reduction in IL-10 gene expression and IL-10 production. We showed that the IL-10 kappa B-like sites ( kappa B1,-2,034 to -2,025; kappa B2, -1,961 to -1,952; kappa B3, -452 to -443) specifically formed a complex with NF-kappa B-containing nuclear extract from MT-2 cells and that NF-kappa B bound with the highest affinity to the kappa B2 element (kappa B2 > kappa B3 > kappa B1). These data suggest a general role for NF-kappa B activation in the induction of IL-10 gene transcription. Activation of IL-10 in HTLV-I-infected cells may contribute to the pathology associated with HTLV-I infection.","['Mori, N', 'Gill, P S', 'Mougdil, T', 'Murakami, S', 'Eto, S', 'Prager, D']","['Mori N', 'Gill PS', 'Mougdil T', 'Murakami S', 'Eto S', 'Prager D']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Body Fluids/chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62531-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):1035-45.,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",['R01 DK46484/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using a panel of 22 (CA)n repeat microsatellite markers mapped to recurrent breakpoint cluster regions specifically involved in leukemia, we investigated 114 adult leukemias (25 acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 32 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 36 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], and 21 chronic myeloid leukemia [CML] in chronic phase) for somatic mutations at these loci. In each patient, DNA from fresh leukemia samples was analyzed alongside normal constitutive DNA from buccal epithelium. We detected loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 81 of 114 patients (ALL 16/25, AML 25/32, CLL 30/36, CML 10/21). Deletions were most often seen in ALL at 11q23 and 19p13; in AML at 8q22 and 11q23; in CLL at 13q14.3, 11q13, and 11q23; and in CML at 3q26. Only six deletions were reported in 74 karyotypes analyzed, whereas in these same cases, 91 LOH events were detected by microsatellites. Of 26 leukemias with a normal karyotype, 16 nevertheless showed at least one LOH by microsatellite analysis. Replication errors were found in 10 of 114 patients (8.8%). Thus, microsatellite instability is rare in leukemia in contrast to many solid tumors. Our findings suggest that in adult leukemia, LOH may be an important genetic event in addition to typical chromosomal translocations. LOH may point to the existence of tumor suppressor genes involved in leukemogenesis to a degree that has hitherto been underestimated.","['Pabst, T', 'Schwaller, J', 'Bellomo, M J', 'Oestreicher, M', 'Muhlematter, D', 'Tichelli, A', 'Tobler, A', 'Fey, M F']","['Pabst T', 'Schwaller J', 'Bellomo MJ', 'Oestreicher M', 'Muhlematter D', 'Tichelli A', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF']","['Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Research, University of Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', '*Sequence Deletion']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62530-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 1;88(3):1026-34.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the transcriptional regulation of IL-3 in megakaryocytes, we transiently transfected IL-3 promoter CAT constructs that contain variable amounts of 5' flanking sequences into the human CMK and CMK-6 megakaryocytic cell lines and identified two positive acting transcriptional regulatory regions, one located between bp -315 and -284, which contains consensus AP-1 and ets binding sites, and a second located between bp -173 and -61. DNase I footprinting assays using CMK or CMK-6 nuclear extracts demonstrate DNA-protein interactions in the identical region protected by T cell or natural killer cell nuclear extracts (between bp -165 to -128), and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate the binding of proteins to three distinct portions of this region. To characterize the transcription factors in megakaryocytic cells that could bind to these two regulatory regions, we performed Northern blot analyses, which showed the presence of ets-1, elf-1 (which is thought to be restricted to T cells), NF-IL3A and AML1 mRNAs, as well as c-fos, jun B, and jun D, but not c-jun mRNA.

These cellular defects can be repaired by physiologic activation, transfection, or fusion of tumor cells with professional APC. Although such defects can be repaired, antitumor specific T cells may still fail to respond in vivo if they may have been tolerized. Here, human pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) was used as a model to determine if primary human tumor cells can function as alloantigen presenting cells (alloAPC) or alternatively whether they induce anergy. In the present report, we show that pre-B cell ALL express alloantigen and adhesion molecules but uniformly lack B7-1 (CD80) and only a subset express B7-2 (CD86). Pre-B ALL cells are inefficient or ineffective alloAPC and those cases that lack expression of B7-1 and B7-2 also induce alloantigen specific T-cell unresponsiveness. Under these circumstances, T-cell unresponsiveness could be prevented by physiologic activation of tumor cells via CD40, cross-linking CD28, or signaling through the common gamma chain of the interleukin-2 receptor on T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that pre-B ALL may be incapable of inducing clinically significant T-cell-mediated antileukemia responses. This defect may be not only due to their inability to function as APC, but also due to their potential to induce tolerance. Attempts to induce clinically significant antitumor immune responses may then require not only mechanisms to repair the antigen presenting capacity of the tumor cells, but also reversal of tolerance.","['Cardoso, A A', 'Schultze, J L', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Freeman, G J', 'Seamon, M J', 'Laszlo, S', 'Billet, A', 'Sallan, S E', 'Gribben, J G', 'Nadler, L M']","['Cardoso AA', 'Schultze JL', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Freeman GJ', 'Seamon MJ', 'Laszlo S', 'Billet A', 'Sallan SE', 'Gribben JG', 'Nadler LM']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', '*Clonal Anergy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/drug effects/physiology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64602-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):41-8.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']","['AI35225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 to 10 microgram/kg/d for 6 days and underwent two to three leukapheresis on days +5, +6, +7. The median cell yield per donor expressed/kg of recipients body weight was as follows: nucleated cells 13 x 10(8)/kg; CD34+ cells 6 x 10(6)/kg; colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage 38 x 10(4)/kg, and CD3+ cells 449 x 10(6)/kg. The diagnoses were chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 4), acute myeloid (n = 9) or lymphoid leukemia (n = 2), acute myelofibrosis (n = 2), multiple myeloma (n = 1), lymphoma (n = 6), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1) myelodysplasia (n = 6). Twenty-eight patients had advanced disease, 29 patients were first grafts, and 2 were second transplants 3 and 9 years after the first. Neutrophil counts of 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet counts of 30 x 10(9)/L platelets were both achieved on day +14 (median). Engraftment could be proven by sex markers or DNA polymorphism in 29 of 31 patients: one had early leukemia relapse and one patient was unevaluable because of early death. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was scored as minimal or absent (grade 0 to 1) in 14 patients, moderate (grade II) in 13, and severe (grade III to IV) in four. Causes of death were leukemia (n = 4), acute GVHD (n = 4, with associated cytomegalovirus infections in three), sepsis (n = 1), liver failure (n = 1), multiorgan failure (n = 1), and hemorrhage (n = 1). The actuarial transplant mortality is 29%, the actuarial relapse rate 22%. Nineteen patients survive with a median follow up of 288 days (100-690). The actuarial 2-year survival is 57%. Three patients received PBSCT from family donors mismatched for one class II antigen: all engrafted, one developed grade I aGVHD; one died of leukemia on day +155; two are alive disease free 267 to 290 days postgraft. This study suggests that thiotepa cyclophosphamide followed by unfractionated PBSC allograft may be an alternative form of transplant for adults with advanced leukemia, also in the setting of one antigen mismatched donor.

The former two (1 and 2) can be referred to as nonleukemic patterns and latter two (3 and 4) as leukemic. In a search for a role for cytokines in leukemic-type growth of MDS progenitor cells, marrow CD34+ cells were purified up to 94% for 8 normal individuals and 88% for 12 MDS patients, using monoclonal antibodies and immunomagnetic microspheres (MDS CD34+ cells). The purified CD34+ cells were cultured for 14 days with various combinations of cytokines, including recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (rGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rIL-3), and stem cell factor (SCF; a ligand for c-kit) in serum-free medium. The clonal growth of MDS CD34+ cells supported by a combination of all of the above cytokines was subdivided into the two patterns of leukemic or nonleukemic, and then the role of individual or combined cytokines in proliferation and differentiation of MDS CD34+ cells was analyzed in each group. Evidence we obtained showed that SCF plays a central role in the leukemic-type growth of MDS CD34+ cells and that G-CSF, GM-CSF; and/or IL-3 synergize with SCF to increase undifferentiated blast cell colonies and clusters over that seen in normal CD34+ cells. SCF is present in either normal or MDS plasma at a level of nanograms per milliliter, and this physiologic concentration of SCF can stimulate progenitor cells. This means that progenitor cells are continuously exposed to stimulation by SCF in vivo and that MDS leukemic cells have a growth advantage over normal blast cells. This depends, at least in part, on cytokines such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and SCF.","['Sawada, K', 'Ieko, M', 'Notoya, A', 'Tarumi, T', 'Koizumi, K', 'Kitayama, S', 'Nishio, H', 'Fukada, Y', 'Yasukouchi, T', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Katoh, S', 'Koike, T']","['Sawada K', 'Ieko M', 'Notoya A', 'Tarumi T', 'Koizumi K', 'Kitayama S', 'Nishio H', 'Fukada Y', 'Yasukouchi T', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Katoh S', 'Koike T']","['Department of Medicine II, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/pathology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Preleukemia/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64635-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):319-27.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) functions as a membrane-associated drug efflux pump whose increased expression results in resistance to anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, vinca alkaloids, and some alkylating agents. This type of resistance occurs as both de novo and acquired resistance to therapy for leukemia. We have studied P-gp expression and function in childhood acute leukemias by developing a series of doxorubicin- and vincristine-selected CEM, T-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines that recapitulate the low levels of expression and resistance seen clinically. These cell lines have been used to develop flow cytometric assays for the semiquantitative measurements of P-gp expression with the MRK16 monoclonal antibody and P-gp function using the enhanced retention of rhodamine 123 in the presence of verapamil, a resistance modulator. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, represented by the D measurement, are used to determine the difference in level of P-gp expression by comparing MRK16 staining to an IgG2a isotype control. When D is > 0.09, there is an excellent correlation (R = 0.82) between P-gp expression and function. The evaluation of 107 bone marrow specimens from 84 children with lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemia showed a statistically significant (P = .004) increase in P-gp function at relapse. P-gp expression at relapse, however, approached but did not reach a significant level (P = .097). Using this methodology, we can identify patients with levels of P-gp expression and function that we can define clinically, as well as children with discordant multidrug resistance phenotypes. This study supports the role of P-gp-mediated drug resistance in childhood leukemia and confirms that P-gp expression and function are measurable in their leukemic blasts. These assays provide the means for the in vitro testing of resistance modulators and the monitoring of in vivo response to treatment with these agents.","['Ivy, S P', 'Olshefski, R S', 'Taylor, B J', 'Patel, K M', 'Reaman, G H']","['Ivy SP', 'Olshefski RS', 'Taylor BJ', 'Patel KM', 'Reaman GH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64634-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):309-18.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']","['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study shows that TEL-AML1 transcripts are frequently detected in pediatric BCP-ALLs and that these transcripts are molecular targets that will simplify the strategy of MRD monitoring in childhood BCP-ALL.","['Cayuela, J M', 'Baruchel, A', 'Orange, C', 'Madani, A', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Daniel, M T', 'Schaison, G', 'Sigaux, F']","['Cayuela JM', 'Baruchel A', 'Orange C', 'Madani A', 'Auclerc MF', 'Daniel MT', 'Schaison G', 'Sigaux F']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cortisone/administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64633-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):302-8.,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)', 'FRALLE 93 protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells of the erythroleukemia line K562, derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, bind to BM fibroblasts (BMFs) but the adhesion cannot be accounted for by integrins or other known adhesion proteins including CD44 or members of the Ig or selectin families. Membrane fragments from K562 cells were radioiodinated and allowed to adhere to BMF monolayers. Adherent proteins were solubilized together with the fibroblasts, analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Four adherent proteins were consistently observed. Two of these, with reduced molecular weights of 52 kD and 35 to 37 kD, were prominent. Addition of soluble thrombospondin and heparin but not fibronectin inhibited binding of K562 membrane proteins to adherent BMFs and immobilized thrombospondin- and heparin-bound K562 proteins. The 52-kD protein has a multimeric structure nonreduced and has characteristics of a glycoprotein. Its adhesion to fibroblasts is divalent cation and temperature sensitive. The 35- to 37-kD protein, whose function is divalent cation but not temperature sensitive, is phosphoinositol-linked and has characteristics identical to an adherent 35- to 37-kD protein identified on murine progenitor cells. Membrane preparations from two cases of acute myeloid leukemia showed an adherent 35- to 37-kD protein and in one case an adherent 52-kD protein without other adherent bands. A K562 subclone with reduced adherence to BMFs showed reduced amounts of adherent 52-kD and 35- to 37-kD proteins. These proteins may be responsible for the adhesion of malignant and normal hematopoietic progenitor cells to the BM microenvironment.","['Bendall, L J', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Bendall LJ', 'Bradstock KF', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64630-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):277-88.,,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation; the underphosphorylated form inhibits transcription whereas the highly phosphorylated form is inactive. Cyclin D1 and its associated kinase (CDK 4/6) phosphorylate pRB in vitro, and therefore are thought to contribute to the regulation of pRB function. To examine the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression on pRB in primary tumor tissue, we studied pRB expression in low-grade B-cell neoplasms, with particular regard to mantle cell lymphoma, which is characterized by cyclin D1 (bcl-1) overexpression. pRB expression was studied by immunostaining with a well-characterized anti-pRB antibody; the phosphorylation status of pRB was examined by immunoblots; and the functional binding capacity of pRB was examined by in vitro binding to adenovirus E1A protein. We studied 3 reactive lymph nodes, 28 low grade B-cell lymphomas, 4 cases of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and 3 plasmacytomas. Reactive lymph nodes showed intense pRB staining of germinal centers, with strongest (2+) staining in the large cells (centroblasts) of the proliferating (dark) zone and weak or no staining of small lymphocytes, including those of the mantle zone. In B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) (4 cases), follicular lymphoma (3 cases) and mucosa-associated (MALT) lymphoma (3 cases) strong (2+) pRB staining was limited to centroblasts in reactive and neoplastic follicles and occasional proliferation centers, with only faint staining of small lymphoid cells. In contrast, 15 of 16 cases of mantle cell lymphoma showed strong (1-2+) staining of most cells; one blastoid mantle cell lymphoma showed only faint pRB staining. All cases of (HCL) and plasmacytoma showed strong pRB staining. Although most lymphomas with strong pRB expression were cyclin D1(+), three cyclin D1(+) cases showed only weak pRB expression (1 B-CLL, 1 blastoid mantle cell, 1 unclassifiable low grade B-cell lymphoma). Conversely, of the 4 pRB(+) HCLs and 3 pRB(+) plasmacytomas, only 1 of each was cyclin D1(+). pRB appeared to exist primarily in the underphosphorylated (fastest migrating) form on Western blot, despite the fact that cyclin D1 was complexed to CDK4, a form in which it normally phosphorylates pRB. In addition, pRB appeared to be unmutated, because it bound normally to the adenovirus E1A protein and showed nuclear localization by immunostaining. We conclude that most cases of mantle cell lymphoma, HCL, and plasmacytoma show high levels of pRB in contrast to follicle center lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma; however, pRB expression does not appear to be consistently related to cyclin D1 overexpression. The pRB appears to be unmutated and underphosphorylated, and therefore should be in its active form. Our data from primary lymphoma tissue suggests that overexpression of cyclin D1, whereas tumorigenic, does not lead to pRB loss or hyperphosporylation. Thus, the mechanism by which cyclin D1 contributes to tumorigenesis and the significance of the restricted expression of pRB in low-grade lymphoid neoplasms remain to be determined.","['Zukerberg, L R', 'Benedict, W F', 'Arnold, A', 'Dyson, N', 'Harlow, E', 'Harris, N L']","['Zukerberg LR', 'Benedict WF', 'Arnold A', 'Dyson N', 'Harlow E', 'Harris NL']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Germinal Center/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64629-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):268-76.,,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']","['CA54672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Growth on laminin enhanced the ability of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to promote morphologic maturation of these cells. Although exposure to ATRA in suspension yielded minimal maturation beyond the myelocyte stage, after 72 hours of exposure to ATRA on laminin the cells acquired the histologic appearance of metamyelocytes, band forms, and segmented neutrophils. After 96 hours, some cells acquired a spindle shape and became tightly adherent. Growth on collagen types I, III, IV, or fibronectin did not have this effect, although some cells did adhere to fibronectin. NB4 cells treated with ATRA in suspension or on laminin acquired the equivalent ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium or cytochrome C. Despite the improved morphologic maturation on laminin, the cells did not express secondary granule proteins such as lactoferrin or neutrophil collagenase. In addition, growth on laminin abolished cell proliferation in the presence of ionomycin. Growth on laminin and/or with ATRA induced new expression of alpha 6 integrin, a laminin receptor, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Different conditions of growth (laminin or differentiation agent) resulted in specific patterns of expression of the alpha 6A and alpha 6B isoforms. Treatment with ATRA also resulted in the acquisition of high-level surface expression of alpha 6 integrin, as assessed by flow cytometry. Thus, treatment of NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells with ATRA induced expression of alpha 6 integrin (a laminin receptor alpha-chain) and enabled more advanced maturation when the cells were grown on the extracellular matrix component, laminin, compared with tissue culture plastic.","['Becker, P S', 'Li, Z', 'Potselueva, T', 'Madri, J A', 'Newburger, P E', 'Berliner, N']","['Becker PS', 'Li Z', 'Potselueva T', 'Madri JA', 'Newburger PE', 'Berliner N']","['Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibronectins/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha6', 'Integrin beta1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Laminin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Laminin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64628-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):261-7.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha6)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['KO8 HL-02656/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-48053/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 28373/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that SLF induces time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of Stat3 in the human growth factor-dependent cell lines MO7e and TF-1. This phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues. Simultaneous stimulation with SLF plus other cytokines that induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, such as interleukin-9 (IL-9) in MO7e cells or IL-6 in TF-1 cells, resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced serine phosphorylation of Stat3. Serine phosphorylation alone did not promote nuclear translocation or DNA binding activity to the sis-inducible element of Stat3. However, costimulation with SLF plus IL-9 in MO7e cells resulted in the nuclear translocation of serine-hyperphosphorylated Stat3. Serine phosphorylation of Stat3 was also observed by the stimulation of cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-3, which do not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. These results suggest that SLF might modulate the Jak-Stat3 pathway by serine phosphorylation and that the Jak-Stat pathway may be differentially regulated by the combinational stimulation of two or more cytokines.","['Gotoh, A', 'Takahira, H', 'Mantel, C', 'Litz-Jackson, S', 'Boswell, H S', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Gotoh A', 'Takahira H', 'Mantel C', 'Litz-Jackson S', 'Boswell HS', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Medicine and Microbiology/Immunology Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64614-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):138-45.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)']","['R0I HL 54037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Our data showed that cross-linking CD7 on KG-1 and KG-1a cells induced transcription, translation, and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Anti-CD7 antibody also augmented the colony formation by KG-1 cells. Protein synthesis in KG-1 cells also increased as a result of anti-CD7 stimulation.

ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood. The NB4 cell line, which is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse, can be used as a model system to study the growth and differentiation of APL cells. Because interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2) and other IFN-inducible gene products regulate cell growth, we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these genes. We show that ATRA directly activates IRF-1 gene expression, followed by activation of IRF-2 and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene expression with slower kinetics. In addition to NB4 cells, ATRA also activated IRF-1 gene expression in HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells, which all respond to ATRA by growth inhibition. A more than additive increase in IRF-1 gene expression was seen with ATRA and IFN-gamma in NB4 cells. ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation pathways, suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF-1 gene activation. The ATRA-induced expression of IRF-1, an activator of transcription and repressor of transformation, may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition, and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Matikainen, S', 'Ronni, T', 'Hurme, M', 'Pine, R', 'Julkunen, I']","['Matikainen S', 'Ronni T', 'Hurme M', 'Pine R', 'Julkunen I']","['Molecular Biology Programme, National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/biosynthesis"", 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64611-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):114-23.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

The PMA-mediated release of ICAM-1 from K 562 cells suggests that the shedding process does not only occur in parallel to the surface expression of ICAM-1, but may be controlled by particular mechanisms of down-regulation.","['Fritz, S', 'Striggow, F', 'Reinhold, D', 'Schluter, T', 'Schonfeld, P', 'Ansorge, S', 'Bohnensack, R']","['Fritz S', 'Striggow F', 'Reinhold D', 'Schluter T', 'Schonfeld P', 'Ansorge S', 'Bohnensack R']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Otto-von-Guericke Universitat Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/07/24 00:00,1996/07/24 00:01,['1996/07/24 00:00'],"['1996/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(96)00039-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(96)00039-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Jul 24;1312(3):255-61. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(96)00039-0.,,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This involved transcriptional interference of AP-1 (Fos/Jun)-driven gene transcription by the formation of inactive GR/Jun heterodimers. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism for GR autoregulation, the expression of GR and c-jun mRNA and protein levels were examined in both mouse L929 fibroblast cells and human CEM-C7 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. A rapid down-regulation of both GR and c-jun mRNA and protein levels occurs in TA-treated L929 cells. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment of Jun-deficient, mouse F9, teratocarcinoma cells causes the induction of c-jun expression. The increased expression of both c-jun mRNA and protein is accompanied by the induction of GR expression. These data further suggest that functional cJun is needed for the expression of the GR and c-jun genes in F9 cells. CEM-C7 cells undergo apoptosis after exposure to glucocorticoids. There is a parallel up-regulation of GR and c-jun mRNA levels in TA-treated CEM-C7 cells. This is accompanied by a concomitant increase in GR and cJun protein levels. Dose-response analyses reveal the expected coordinate regulation of both GR and c-jun mRNA and protein in L929 cells (decreasing) and in CEM-C7 cells (increasing). However, approximately 20-fold less TA is required for the inhibition of GR and c-jun expression as compared to that required for the stimulation of these two genes. These data demonstrate that the coordinate regulation of GR and c-jun gene expression is dose-dependent and cell type-specific. These results, along with previously reported data, suggest that GR complex formation with itself or with another transcription factor is important for the coordinate up- and down-regulation, respectively, of the GR and c-jun genes.","['Barrett, T J', 'Vig, E', 'Vedeckis, W V']","['Barrett TJ', 'Vig E', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans 70112-1393, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Homeostasis', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells', 'Mice', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/07/30 00:00,1996/07/30 00:01,['1996/07/30 00:00'],"['1996/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi960058j [doi]', 'bi960058j [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Jul 30;35(30):9746-53. doi: 10.1021/bi960058j.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",['DK47211/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

This difference appeared to be independent of other clinical features such as sex, age, white blood cell count, FAB classification, and CD34 expression. In vitro resistance to DNR was not related to the probability of CCR. We conclude that in vitro drug resistance assessed with the MTT assay appears to be associated with short- and long-term clinical outcome in AML. Confirmatory studies comprising a sufficient number of patients for multivariate analyses should prove whether in vitro resistance to ARA-C will appear to be an independent risk factor.","['Klumper, E', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Pieters, R', 'Huismans, D R', 'Loonen, A H', 'Rottier, A', 'Westra, G', 'Veerman, A J']","['Klumper E', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Pieters R', 'Huismans DR', 'Loonen AH', 'Rottier A', 'Westra G', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Paediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1742.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(4):903-10. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1742.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 15 cases we concurrently investigated the relation between in vitro blast cell survival (MTT assay) and blast cell proliferation (3H-thymidine incorporation) in the presence and absence of myeloid growth factors (GFs) G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-3 (individually and in combination). A highly significant correlation was found between blast cell survival and blast cell proliferation (r = 0.87, P < 1 x 10(-4). Furthermore, in 40 evaluable adult patients who completed intravenous induction chemotherapy and were evaluable for response to chemotherapy we found a positive correlation between in vitro blast survival (MTT assay) and response to chemotherapy with high blast survival being associated with poor response to chemotherapy (P = 0.05). Moreover, in a multivariate analysis, high blast cell survival was significantly associated with high CD13 expression and monocytic phenotype (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, we found an inverse relationship between the baseline proliferation of the blasts and the magnitude of response to the GFs (P < 0.02), indicating that cells with low baseline proliferation were more readily stimulated by growth factors. Finally, we found a significant correlation between leukaemic cell survival and cellular drug resistance towards Dau (P = 0.001) and Mitox (P = 0.03), but not towards Ara-C (P = 0.68) and Acla (P = 0.13).

It is therefore one of the most serious long-term complications of current cancer treatment and is likely to increase as longer survival rates for the primary tumour are achieved.

For this, we scored the numbers of subcolonies produced by individual BFU-E in cultures of normal marrow and blood cells and in cultures of CML blood cells. The formation of an erythroid burst consisting of a single subcolony was taken as evidence for immediate terminal differentiation; the formation of multiple subcolonies was taken as evidence for commitment to terminal differentiation only after several cell generations. Therefore the probability of differentiation can be obtained by scoring the numbers of subcolonies in individual erythroid bursts. We found that the probability of differentiation is decreased (P = 0.0004) and the number of subcolonies increased (P = 0.01) in CML BFU-E compared with normal BFU-E. The cellularity of the BFU-E was also increased in CML. Using the probabilities of differentiation and renewal obtained from the BFU-E cultures the results fitted the predictions of a stochastic branching model. These results indicate that (a) commitment to terminal erythroid differentiation occurs over several cell generations in populations of BFU-E, (b) the probability of commitment to terminal differentiation (PD) within a particular population of BFU-E, remains a constant independent of the number of cell generations involved, (c) PD is lower during burst formation by CML BFU-E than by normal BFU-E, and (d) commitment to terminal differentiation occurs over more cell generations in CML burst formation than in normal burst formation. Therefore a reduced probability of differentiation may be a primary defect and could explain the expansion of the erythroid progenitor cell compartment in CML.","['Marley, S B', 'Lewis, J L', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Lewis JL', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon MY']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*pathology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1738.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(4):878-83. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1738.x.,,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, variation between patients in the recovery of Ph- cells in culture limits the application of this procedure to a minority. Treatment that effectively reduces in vivo tumour burden prior to initiation of LTBMC may improve the selection of Ph- cells in culture. To test this hypothesis we evaluated the frequency and degree of cytogenetic conversion to Ph- haemopoiesis in LTBMC from four independent groups of CML patients: Untreated (n = 19); conventional dosage of hydroxyurea (HU) (n = 10); pulse high-dose HU (P-HU) (n = 22) and interferon (IFN)-alpha (n = 12). In this study IFN-alpha therapy resulted in a significantly higher incidence of patients with detectable Ph- clonogenic cells in the marrow (P = 0.01) and with > or = 50% Ph- haemopoiesis in LTBMC as compared to newly diagnosed patients (P = 0.05). Also, sequential culture studies undertaken in 14 CML patients at diagnosis and following the start of pulse highdose HU therapy showed that in eight patients the average proportion of Ph- metaphases detected in LTBMC substantially increased from 1.7% (range 0-7) at diagnosis to levels of 71% (range 14-100) after treatment. Therefore we conclude that the use of IFN or pulse high-dose HU in early stage disease appears to create an opportunity to harvest the marrow for long-term culture (LTC) purging with reduced leukaaemic burden.","['Coutinho, L H', 'Brereton, M L', 'Santos, A M', 'Ryder, W D', 'Chang, J', 'Harrison, C J', 'Yin, J A', 'Dexter, T M', 'Testa, N G']","['Coutinho LH', 'Brereton ML', 'Santos AM', 'Ryder WD', 'Chang J', 'Harrison CJ', 'Yin JA', 'Dexter TM', 'Testa NG']","['CRC Department of Experimental Haematology, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1733.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(4):869-77. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1733.x.,,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the nine chronic-phase patients the mean number of days from the end of hydroxyurea to the commencement of harvesting was 14.5 (range 10-18). The patient in accelerated phase recovered and was harvested after 6 d. The mean number of aphereses performed was 3.4. Adequate numbers of stem cells were obtained in 9/10 patients judged by our usual criteria. Side-effects were mild in comparison to published intravenous schedules. No patients lost their hair. Five (50%) patients required admission with neutropenic fever which responded to antibiotics in all cases. Four (40%) patients developed a transient rash and four (40%) experienced mild oral mucostis. This level of toxicity enabled half of the patients to be treated entirely on an out-patient basis. The harvest products were analysed for cells belonging to the leukaemic clone by conventional cytogenetics, FISH and PCR. All were PCR positive.

In contrast, bFGF was slightly elevated in all CMPD conditions when compared to age-matched controls. A neutralizing antibody to calmodulin was demonstrated to significantly influence the in vitro proliferation of normal human fibroblasts, an effect dependent on both cell density and the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS). Essentially, the antibody reduced FCS-induced proliferation of low-density fibroblasts but had little or no inhibitory effect on high-density fibroblasts in the absence of FCS. In addition, extracellular calmodulin was shown not to interact with known fibroblast mitogens, namely, IFG-1, EGF, bDGF and PDGF.

The FA phenotype is so variable that diagnosis on the basis of clinical manifestations alone can be difficult. The modern diagnosis of FA no longer rests entirely on the constellation of clinical and haematological abnormalities first described by Fanconi, but depends on finding elevated chromosomal breakage after incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with the chemical clastogens diepoxybutane (DEB) or mitomycin-C (MMC). The cloning of the gene for FA complementation group C [FAC] provides an opportunity to test the validity of the ""DEB test' which in recent times has become the main arbiter as to whether a patient is classified as FA or non-FA.

The ELISA uses a mouse monoclonal antibody (Ab) as the capture Ab and a biotinylated rabbit polyclonal Ab as the detector. The ELISA was reproducible, highly sensitive and specific for human TPO. The coefficients of intra-and inter assay variation were from 3.0% to 4.9% and from 5.9% to 6.1%, respectively. The quantitative limit of the ELISA was 0.09 fmol/ml in serum. The quantitative limit was lower than the normal level. The dose-response curves of serum samples from healthy volunteers and patients with haemopoietic disorders were parallel to the standard curves. The ELISA did not cross-react with a variety of blood components and cytokines to produce false-positive results. The serum TPO concentrations from 29 normal males and 21 females were 0.79 +/- 0.35 and 0.70 +/- 0.26 fmol/ml, respectively.

MEG-01 expressed mRNAs of PKC alpha, -beta I, -beta II, -delta, -epsilon, -eta, -theta and -zeta, but not PKC gamma. At the protein molecule level, MEG-01 was observed to express PKC alpha, -beta I, -beta II,- epsilon, -theta and -zeta, but lack -gamma, -delta and -eta. When differentiation of MEG-01 was induced by 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), rapid translocation from cytosol to membrane fraction and down-regulation of PKC alpha, -epsilon and -theta was observed in 1-2h. On the other hand, PKC beta I and -beta II were observed to translocate not only to the membrane fraction but also to the cytoskeletal fraction in a different manner, and their down-regulation, especially beta II, was very slow. The myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) in the membrane fraction of MEG-01 cells was observed to decrease gradually throughout the differentiation process. Additionally, time-course study of TPA treatment indicated that incubation of the cells for 30 min is sufficient for differentiation. These results strongly suggest that the activation of PKC alpha, -epsilon and -theta is involved in the initiation of differentiation, and that PKC beta I and -beta II have important roles in the maintenance of differentiation. Although PKC zeta was resistant to TPA treatment and its translocation was reduced, the amount of this isozyme in the cytosol fraction decreased throughout the differentiation process.","['Nagata, K I', 'Okano, Y', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nagata KI', 'Okano Y', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Molecular Pathobiochemistry, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1714.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(4):762-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1714.x.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, normal bronchi are relatively devoid of PMN, suggesting that there exists a mechanism to dampen acute inflammation in the lung. We have previously reported that bronchial lavage from normal humans contains a nonpolar peptide that inhibits PMN chemotaxis and oxidant production. In the present study we devised preparative methods to obtain sufficient quantities of a similar inhibitor molecule for partial amino acid sequencing and allow production of truncated analogues. Amino acid sequencing demonstrated that the peptide includes a 10-amino-acid sequence that is completely homologous to a sequence of amino acids contained in the influenza A nucleoprotein. Synthesized peptides containing this 10-amino-acid sequence inhibited PMN chemotaxis and oxidant production. In addition, PMN lysates actively phosphorylated peptides containing the 10-amino-acid sequence or a partial sequence containing an apparent phosphorylation site. U937 cells were noted to be one source of this inhibitor, as a similarly sized nonpolar inhibitor peptide was purified from U937 culture supernatants. In addition, U937 and monocyte cellular lysates contained proteins recognized by an antiserum directed at the influenza A nucleoprotein.

Adaptation of this technique for infants is complicated by the small diameter of some body parts, and by the necessity to treat while the patient is anesthetized. Even degraded, low energy electrons can easily penetrate fingers and toes. Therefore, dose from 6 positions becomes additive, and the total dose to small circumferences can be 3 to 4 times more than skin dose on the torso, raising concerns about uneven bone growth in the developing child. Special phantoms were designed for extensive dosimetry needed to determine both dose rate and dose summation from the overlapping beams.

The exact events involved in the induction of target cell apoptosis remain elusive, but research indicates a role for members of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE)/Ced-3 family of cysteine proteases. The exact nature of the protease(s) involved is yet to be determined. Here we use activity assays and peptide inhibitors of ICE/Ced-3 proteases to study their role in Fas-mediated killing. We find that while certain inhibitors block DNA fragmentation and chromium release, others do not. Most notably, potent inhibitors of CPP32 and ICE could not inhibit DNA fragmentation during all cases of Fas-mediated cytotoxicity although an ""ICE"" inhibitor could suppress 51Cr release. Additionally, we find that CPP32 is not cleaved in all target cells during Fas killing. Although ICE activity (as measured by a fluorogenic substrate) is present in cell lysates from anti-Fas-treated cells, we found no pro-IL-1beta-cleaving activity in these lysates. Taken together, our results suggest that an alternate pathway to DNA fragmentation exists, which does not involve CPP32 activity, and that CPP32 and ICE activities are not essential to Fas-mediated killing.","['Darmon, A J', 'Bleackley, R C']","['Darmon AJ', 'Bleackley RC']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', '*Apoptosis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Caspase 1', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Line', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Helminth Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1996/09/06 00:00,1996/09/06 00:01,['1996/09/06 00:00'],"['1996/09/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.36.21699 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)61846-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Sep 6;271(36):21699-702. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.36.21699.,,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (ced-3 protein, C elegans)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, we determined the genomic organization of the beta1, 4GalNAc-T gene. The gene consists of at least 11 exons and spans >8 kilobase pairs. The coding region is located in exons 2-11. To determine the transcription initiation sites, 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis and ribonuclease protection assays were performed using RNA obtained from the human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-31. Consequently, we defined three transcription initiation sites and the alternative usage of three exons. Exons 1a and 1b partially overlap; the latter is part (3'-side) of the former and corresponds to the 5'-noncoding region of the cDNA clone previously isolated. The third transcript, exon 1c, corresponds to nucleotides -520 to -412 (position +1 = A of ATG of beta1,4GalNAc-T cDNA), which are considered to be in intron 1 based on the cloned cDNA sequence. Ribonuclease protection assays revealed the corresponding protection bands in samples of the gene-expressing cell lines. 5'-Flanking regions of individual initiation sites showed promoter activity when analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay in SK-MEL-31 cells. The multiple transcription initiation sites and their promoters/enhancers identified here might be differentially involved in the cell type-specific expression of the beta1,4GalNAc-T gene.

We report here that Tax is able to transactivate a classical pol III promoter, VA-I. In cotransfection experiments, Tax is shown to increase transcription of the VA-I promoter approximately 25-fold. Moreover, Tax is able to activate VA-I transcription when added exogenously to an in vitro transcription reaction. Using Tax affinity column chromatography, we demonstrate that Tax is able to deplete a HeLa cell extract for components required for transcription of VA-I. The transcriptional activity of the Tax-depleted extract can be restored by the 0.6 phosphocellulose fraction. Interestingly, a consensus binding site for cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) is located upstream of the VA-I promoter, and deletion of this element results in the loss of Tax responsiveness. When this CREB binding site is replaced by a Gal-4 binding site, the VA-I promoter can be transactivated by a Gal4-Tax fusion protein. Taken together, these results suggest that Tax may activate pol III and pol II promoter through a similar mechanism involving the CREB activation pathway. It is also possible that Tax affects pol III transcription by direct interaction with a component of the pol III transcriptional machinery.","['Piras, G', 'Dittmer, J', 'Radonovich, M F', 'Brady, J N']","['Piras G', 'Dittmer J', 'Radonovich MF', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase III/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1996/08/23 00:00,1996/08/23 00:01,['1996/08/23 00:00'],"['1996/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.34.20501 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73859-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Aug 23;271(34):20501-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.34.20501.,,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been used to examine simultaneously for the first time the relationship between chelation of intracellular iron and the rate of removal and regeneration of the tyrosyl radical of ribonucleotide reductase within intact human leukemia K562 cells. The different physiochemical characteristics of relatively hydrophobic low molecular weight bidentate hydroxypyridinone chelators and the higher molecular weight hexadentate ferrioxamine have been exploited to elucidate these interactions further. The base-line concentration of EPR-detectable mononuclear nonheme iron complexes was 3.15 =/- 1.05 microM, rising on incubation with chelators more rapidly with hydroxypyridinones than with desferrioxamine. Hydroxypyridinones also removed the tyrosyl radical more rapidly, apparently as a consequence of depletion of the intracellular iron pools necessary to regenerate the active enzyme and compatible with their reportedly greater cell toxicity. The radical decay rate is consistent with previous models, suggesting that iron is spontaneously removed from mammalian ribonucleotide reductase. Upon removal of extracellular chelator the regeneration of the tyrosyl radical was significantly faster for hydroxypyridinones than for desferrioxamine, consistent with their differential effects on cell cycle synchronization.","['Cooper, C E', 'Lynagh, G R', 'Hoyes, K P', 'Hider, R C', 'Cammack, R', 'Porter, J B']","['Cooper CE', 'Lynagh GR', 'Hoyes KP', 'Hider RC', 'Cammack R', 'Porter JB']","['Department of Biological and Chemical Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Deferoxamine/chemistry', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/chemistry', 'Pyridones/chemistry', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']",1996/08/23 00:00,1996/08/23 00:01,['1996/08/23 00:00'],"['1996/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.34.20291 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73830-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Aug 23;271(34):20291-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.34.20291.,,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Pyridones)', '115900-75-9 (1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

In these G1-arrested cells v-Abl does not interfere with the activation of cyclin D1 or cyclin E-dependent kinases. As a result, v-Abl does not block the hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein RB. However, activation of cyclin A-dependent kinase is inhibited due to a v-Abl-induced block in the accumulation of cyclin A mRNA and protein. Ectopic expression of cyclin A enabled the v-Abl-arrested cells to enter S phase, whereas cyclins E and D1, or E2Fs 1 and 4 could not overcome the v-Abl arrest.

Enhancer activation in response to T cell stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate, phytohemagglutinin, soluble or cross-linked antibodies to the T cell receptor, or antigen is mediated through this site in conjunction with its two adjacent Elf-1 binding sites, PuB1 and PuB2, and a kappaB site. Site-specific mutation of the pets element significantly reduces inducible activation of this enhancer but does not affect its transactivation by HIV-2 tat or other viral transactivators. Similar TG-rich sequences adjacent to ets-binding sites have also been found to be functionally important in the human T-cell leukemia virus type I and murine Moloney leukemia virus enhancers. As the cellular factor binding to the pets site plays a significant role in regulating the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes, we have purified this protein from bovine spleens and demonstrate that it is 43 kDa in size. In addition, using glycerol gradient centrifugation, Southwestern blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays employing purified protein eluted from a gel, and a new in solution UV cross-linking competitive assay, we show that the dominant protein binding to the pets site is 43 kDa in size. These results indicate that a nuclear protein of 43 kDa binds specifically to the pets site of the HIV-2 enhancer and may mediate transcriptional activation of this important human pathogen in response to T cell stimulation. As retroviruses generally expropriate important human regulatory proteins for their own use, the 43-kDa pets factor is also likely to play a significant role in signal transduction in T cells and in other cellular processes.","['Fu, G K', 'Markovitz, D M']","['Fu GK', 'Markovitz DM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*HIV Enhancer', 'HIV-2/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1996/08/09 00:00,1996/08/09 00:01,['1996/08/09 00:00'],"['1996/08/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.32.19599 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)84406-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Aug 9;271(32):19599-605. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.32.19599.,,"['0 (Elk3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']","['AI30924/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI36685/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This growth promotion is dependent upon the structure of the amino terminus of the protein, and the ABL mutation will cooperate with certain BCR sequences in BCR/ABL fusion proteins to deregulate ABL kinase activity.","['Allen, P B', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['Allen PB', 'Wiedemann LM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, Fulham Road, London, SW3 6JB United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphopeptides/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism']",1996/08/09 00:00,1996/08/09 00:01,['1996/08/09 00:00'],"['1996/08/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.32.19585 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)84404-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Aug 9;271(32):19585-91. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.32.19585.,,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the proofreading mechanisms that remove 3'-F-ara-AMP from DNA represent a possible means of resistance to the drug, the present study investigated the excision of incorporated F-ara-AMP from DNA by the 3' --> 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase epsilon from human leukemia CEM cells. Using the drug-containing and normal deoxynucleotide oligomers (21-base) annealed to M13mp18(+) DNA as the excision substrates, we demonstrated that DNA polymerase epsilon was unable to effectively remove F-ara-AMP from the 3'-end of the oligomer. However, 3'-terminal dAMP and subsequently other deoxynucleotides were readily excised from DNA in a distributive fashion. Kinetic evaluation demonstrated that although DNA polymerase epsilon has a higher affinity for F-ara-AMP-terminated DNA (Km = 7.1 pM) than for dAMP-terminated DNA of otherwise identical sequence (Km = 265 pM), excision of F-ara-AMP proceeded at a substantially slower rate (Vmax = 0.053 pmol/min/mg) than for 3'-terminal dAMP (Vmax = 1.96 pmol/min/mg). When the 3'-5' phosphodiester bond between F-ara-AMP at the 3'-terminus and the adjacent normal deoxynucleotide was cleaved by DNA polymerase epsilon, the reaction products appeared to remain associated with the enzyme but without the formation of a covalent bond. No further excision of the remaining oligomers was observed after the addition of fresh DNA polymerase epsilon to the reaction. Furthermore, the addition of DNA polymerase alpha and deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the excision reaction failed to extend the oligomers. After DNA polymerase epsilon had been incubated with 3'-F-ara-AMP-21-mer for 10 min, the enzyme was no longer able to excise 3'-terminal dAMP from a freshly added normal 21-mer annealed to M13mp18(+) template. We conclude that the 3' --> 5' exonuclease of human DNA polymerase epsilon can remove 3'-terminal F-ara-AMP from DNA with difficulty and that this excision results in a mechanism-mediated formation of ""dead end complex.""","['Kamiya, K', 'Huang, P', 'Plunkett, W']","['Kamiya K', 'Huang P', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

The P2Y7 cDNA was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells: binding studies thereon showed a very high affinity for ATP (37 +/- 6 nM), much less for UTP and ADP (approximately 1300 nM), and a novel rank order of affinities in the binding series studied of 8 nucleotides and suramin. The P2Y7 receptor sequence appears to denote a different subfamily from that of all the other known P2Y purinoceptors, with only a few of their characteristic sequence motifs shared. The P2Y7 receptor mRNA is abundantly present in the human heart and the skeletal muscle, moderately in the brain and liver, but not in the other tissues tested. The P2Y7 receptor mRNA was also abundantly present in the rat heart and cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The P2Y7 receptor is functionally coupled to phospholipase C in COS-7 cells transiently expressing this receptor. The P2Y7 gene was shown to be localized to human chromosome 14. We have thus cloned a unique member of the P2Y purinoceptor family which probably plays a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.","['Akbar, G K', 'Dasari, V R', 'Webb, T E', 'Ayyanathan, K', 'Pillarisetti, K', 'Sandhu, A K', 'Athwal, R S', 'Daniel, J L', 'Ashby, B', 'Barnard, E A', 'Kunapuli, S P']","['Akbar GK', 'Dasari VR', 'Webb TE', 'Ayyanathan K', 'Pillarisetti K', 'Sandhu AK', 'Athwal RS', 'Daniel JL', 'Ashby B', 'Barnard EA', 'Kunapuli SP']","['Department of Physiology, Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center, Temple University Medical School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/02 00:00,1996/08/02 00:01,['1996/08/02 00:00'],"['1996/08/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.31.18363 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)31990-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Aug 2;271(31):18363-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.31.18363.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)']",,['GENBANK/U41070'],,,,,,,,,,

When the nuclei, isolated from these cells were digested with micrococcal nuclease, chromatin DNA was cleaved into oligonucleosomal units. Although sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease considerably differed from cell to cell, Group I cells were generally more sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than Group II cells. Similar sensitivity to DNase I was observed in both groups of cells. Acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of histone fractions from control and apoptosing HL-60 cells (induced either by hydrogen peroxide or UV irradiation) revealed no significant change in the relative composition of five major histones, indicating the absence of selective degradation of histone HI, but rather the nonspecific degradation of many nuclear proteins.

We also incubated various types of human tumor cells with PSH plus copper for 24 hours and then measured the number of surviving cells 24 hours later. For the in vivo studies, we measured the effects of 7 daily i.p. injections of 10 mg of PSH on the growth rates of interleukin-5 genetransfected J558L tumors in 20 BALB/c mice. Our experiments demonstrated that PSH plus copper exerted a significant antiproliferative effect on tumor cells in vitro that was neutralized by protein or catalase and enhanced by adherent eosinophil peroxidase. Human acute myelogenous leukemia cells were especially sensitive to PSH plus copper. In vivo, however, PSH had no significant effect on the growth rates of J558L tumors that were infiltrated by eosinophils. We conclude that the interaction of PSH-copper with tumors is primarily antiproliferative, mediated by hydrogen peroxide, and inhibitable by protein. Therefore, for PSH to be an effective antineoplastic drug strategies will need to be developed to prevent its rapid neutralization by protein.","['Samoszuk, M', 'Nguyen, V']","['Samoszuk M', 'Nguyen V']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, Irvine 92717-4800, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Copper/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Penicillamine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 May-Jun;16(3A):1219-23.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The results presented here demonstrate that c-Rel can be modulated by hematopoietic cytokines and suggest that bcr/abl expression has an impact on these responses and that c-Rel may be a downstream effector for p210BCR/ABL.","['Neumann, M', 'Wilisch, A', 'Ma, B C', 'Druker, B J', 'Serfling, E', 'Franza, B R Jr']","['Neumann M', 'Wilisch A', 'Ma BC', 'Druker BJ', 'Serfling E', 'Franza BR Jr']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 May-Jun;16(3A):1075-83.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",['CA 40512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a family with an adult onset, incompletely penetrant, autosomal dominant syndrome of myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia, affecting at least eight, and probably ten, individuals from three generations. The patients have developed leukemias differing in morphologic subtype, tumor cytogenetics, and abruptness of presentation. Some have presented with acute onset and others with protracted myelodysplasia. This family does not have an unusual incidence of other malignancies; however, one person at 50% risk of inheriting this gene developed atypical mycobacterium infection in the absence of leukemia, but also without appreciable risk factors for acquired deficiencies in cellular immunity. Features common to affected family members, including the individual with mycobacterium infection, are the early presence in the bone marrow of red cell and platelet maturation defects. A search for mutations in diseased marrows fails to detect abnormalities of p53 or N-ras. Two of the affected family members, third degree relatives, have co-inherited a constitutional chromosomal banding variation of 9p21-22, potentially suggesting linkage to this locus. The variable penetrance and expressivity of this syndrome support a multistep model of leukemia evolution, in which the gene defined by this family's syndrome is the signal step.","['Horwitz, M', 'Sabath, D E', 'Smithson, W A', 'Radich, J']","['Horwitz M', 'Sabath DE', 'Smithson WA', 'Radich J']","['Markey Molecular Medicine Center, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Infection/diagnosis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199608)52:4<295::AID-AJH9>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199608)52:4<295::AID-AJH9>3.0.CO;2-N [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Aug;52(4):295-304. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199608)52:4<295::AID-AJH9>3.0.CO;2-N.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of our study was to document early complete chimerism in BMT and PBSCT recipients using STR, and to determine whether the initial WBC recovery correlated with the days required to attain complete chimerism. A total of 5 patients (2 PBSCT and 3 BMT) were followed by STR after transplantation. Peripheral blood obtained prior to transplantation was used to determine the 2 most informative STR probes for each donor/recipient pair. STR were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 8 commercial probes, and PCR products were visualized with silver staining. Peripheral blood was evaluated daily post-transplantation for WBC counts and to identify the presence of mixed or full chimerism by STR. The sensitivity of the STR technique varied from 0.05 to 1%, depending on the probe. Full chimerism was documented between day 9 and 14 in PBSCT recipients and on day 14 and 16 in BMT recipients. The initial rise in WBC occurred within 3 days of the onset of full chimerism, indicating that full chimerism is a more sensitive indicator of early engraftment. Periodic recipient monitoring using STR after complete chimerism identifies those patients who revert to mixed chimeras. The STR method may be useful in future studies to determine the significance of early engraftment and the clinical implications of sustained complete chimerism or mixed chimerism.","['Frankel, W', 'Chan, A', 'Corringham, R E', 'Shepherd, S', 'Rearden, A', 'Wang-Rodriguez, J']","['Frankel W', 'Chan A', 'Corringham RE', 'Shepherd S', 'Rearden A', 'Wang-Rodriguez J']","['UCSD Medical Center, La Jolla, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA/*analysis', 'DNA Probes', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Silver Staining', '*Transplantation Chimera']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199608)52:4<281::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199608)52:4<281::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-O [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Aug;52(4):281-7. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199608)52:4<281::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-O.,,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no correlation between the percentage of CD20-positive T cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio, patient age, gender, or diagnosis. CD20dim positive cells included immature B cells and CD20-positive T cells.

The second case was a 39-year-old male with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess of blasts). In the latter case, the p210-type mRNA appeared after leukemic transformation, and the p190-type transcript was detected only during the late stage when the Ph1 chromosome was first observed. The leukemias in these two patients were aggressive in their clinical courses.

Moreover, clonal leukemic cells could be detected by Southern blot analyses indicating the persistence of blasts. Occasionally BM cells obtained in CR showed a cytologically, immunologically differentiated phenotype, but nevertheless DNA-rearranged cells indicated differentiated blasts ('clonal remission'). Five years after diagnosis the patient presented with an isolated pleural effusion. Southern blot analysis identified the original leukemic clone because pleural cells showed the same clonal Ig gene rearrangement as the cells at diagnosis. The patient died 6 years after diagnosis during her fourth relapse of AML.

Sequence analysis revealed the absence of a TATA motif and the presence of Sp1, PU.1, Oct, CRE, Myb, Ets, and Ets-like binding sites in both upstream regions. Several initiator elements (Inr) that overlap the transcription start sites were also identified. These proximal and distal upstream regions and their deletion mutants were cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene and used in transfection assays. We demonstrate that both upstream regions function as promoters in hematopoietic (Jurkat) and nonhematopoietic (HEK) cell lines. The activity of both promoters was orientation dependent and was enhanced, in a cell-type specific manner, by a heterologous enhancer sequence. These results indicate that additional control elements, either negative or positive, regulate the tissue-specific expression of AML1.","['Ghozi, M C', 'Bernstein, Y', 'Negreanu, V', 'Levanon, D', 'Groner, Y']","['Ghozi MC', 'Bernstein Y', 'Negreanu V', 'Levanon D', 'Groner Y']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/05 00:00,1996/03/05 00:01,['1996/03/05 00:00'],"['1996/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.5.1935 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Mar 5;93(5):1935-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.5.1935.,PMC39886,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",['HD21229/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['GENBANK/AF015262', 'GENBANK/AF025841', 'GENBANK/AJ229043', 'GENBANK/U39636', 'GENBANK/U39637']",,,,,,,,,,

The rearrangement in 3q26 has been reported to occur near the Evi-1 locus, implicating that it is the critical gene deregulated in the 3q21q26 syndrome. Here we present a structural abnormality of Evi-1 protein in a case with the 3q21q26 syndrome. In this case carrying typical inv(3)(q21q26), the 3q26 breakpoint is located within an intron of the Evi-1 gene, and resulted in overexpression of normally unexpressed, an aberrant form of Evi-1 protein, in which the C-terminal 44 amino acids of wild-type Evi-1 protein were truncated and replaced by five amino acids. The truncated Evi-1 protein is shown to increase AP1 activity when expressed in NIH3T3 cells as its wild-type counterpart. We also show that the origin of this peculiar type of rearrangement of the Evi-1 gene is not an artifact during establishment of the cell line, but is the event that occurred in the primary leukemic cells.

However, transformation appears to require additional, as yet poorly characterized, genetic changes in infected cells. JNK is a recently characterized member of the MAP kinase family. Its signaling cascade is distinct from other members and has been demonstrated to play an important role in T-cell activation, at least partially through its downstream targets, c-jun and ATF-2. Here we demonstrate constitutive activation of the JNK cascade in human lymphocytes transformed in vitro by HTLV-1 and also in Tax transformed murine fibroblasts. Such activation is not induced by Tax expression alone, and occurs only when infected lymphocytes become IL-2 independent or immortalized. Constitutive JNK activation was also found in leukocytes isolated from ATL patients. The acquisition of constitutive JNK activation may represent an important later event in HTLV-1 tumorigenesis.","['Xu, X', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Kitajima, I', 'McGuire, K', 'Li, Q', 'Su, B', 'Nerenberg, M']","['Xu X', 'Heidenreich O', 'Kitajima I', 'McGuire K', 'Li Q', 'Su B', 'Nerenberg M']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92307, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/pathology/virology', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology/virology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/04 00:00,1996/07/04 00:01,['1996/07/04 00:00'],"['1996/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jul 4;13(1):135-42.,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

By mechanisms that are still under investigation, this event increases the cellular levels of the bcl-2 mRNA and thereby induces an overproduction of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein which is likely responsible for neoplastic transformation. In an effort to identify potential upregulators of bcl-2 activity in t(14;18) cells, we found, by strand-specific RT-PCR, a bcl-2 antisense transcript that is present in the t(14;18) DOHH2 and SU-DHL-4 but not in the t(14;18)-negative Raji and Jurkat lymphoid cell lines, and thus appears to be dependent on the bcl-2/IgH fusion. This antisense transcript is a hybrid bc1-2/IgH RNA, that originates in the IgH locus, encompasses the t(14;18) fusion site and spans at least the complete 3' UTR region of the bcl-2 mRNA. To achieve some insight into its biological function, we treated the t(14;18) DOHH2 cell line with oligonucleotides (ODNs) by specifically targeting the bc1-2/IgH antisense strand. These ODNs lowered bcl-2 gene expression, inhibited neoplastic cell growth by inducing apoptosis. We would like to propose the hypothesis that the bc1-2/IgH antisense transcript may contribute, by an unknown mechanism, to upregulation of bcl-2 gene expression in t(14;18) cells.

MyD118 was one of the novel MyD genes cloned, subsequently observed also to be a primary response gene to TGF-beta, which induces M1 cells for growth arrest and apoptosis uncoupled from differentiation. The MyD118 encoded protein was observed to be remarkably similar to the protein encoded by Gadd45, a growth arrest and DNA damage induced gene, regulated in part by the tumor suppressor p53. Though evidence has accumulated that MyD118 functions as an important modulator of negative growth control both in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, its mechanism of action is unknown. To better understand the role(s) of MyD118 in negative growth control, we have analysed the expression and biological characteristics of the MyD118 protein, compared to the Gadd45 protein, in distinct pathways of growth arrest and apoptosis, including p53 dependent and independent pathways either coupled or uncoupled from differentiation. It is shown that MyD118 and Gadd45 differentially accumulated upon induction of distinct pathways of growth arrest and apoptosis; notably, MyD118, but not Gadd45, was induced by TGF-beta, whereas Gadd45, but not MyD118, was induced by activating wild type (wt) p53 function. It is also shown that MyD118 is a nuclear protein, which regardless of the pathway induced, predominantly localized within the cell nucleus, and interacted with the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA and the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor P21WAF1/CIP1. MyD118 also modestly stimulated DNA repair in vitro. All of these characteristics were shared with Gadd45. Finally, it is demonstrated that MyD118, Gadd45 and p21 synergized in the suppression of colony formation by NIH3T3 cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that MyD118 and Gadd45 are representative of a new protein family that share remarkable functional similarities in the control of distinct pathways of negative growth, including the suppression of cellular growth and programmed cell death.","['Vairapandi, M', 'Balliet, A G', 'Fornace, A J Jr', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Vairapandi M', 'Balliet AG', 'Fornace AJ Jr', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",1996/06/20 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/06/20 00:00'],"['1996/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jun 20;12(12):2579-94.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (GADD45B protein, human)', '0 (Gadd45b protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']","['1R01CA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30 CA12227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of these observations, we suggest that some CES-2/PAR family transcription factors are evolutionary conserved regulators of programmed cell death.","['Metzstein, M M', 'Hengartner, M O', 'Tsung, N', 'Ellis, R E', 'Horvitz, H R']","['Metzstein MM', 'Hengartner MO', 'Tsung N', 'Ellis RE', 'Horvitz HR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/cytology/*genetics', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Helminth', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Helminth', 'Helminth Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Motor Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",1996/08/08 00:00,1996/08/08 00:01,['1996/08/08 00:00'],"['1996/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/382545a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1996 Aug 8;382(6591):545-7. doi: 10.1038/382545a0.,,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CES-2 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Helminth)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,['GENBANK/U60979'],,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells selected in 0.05 micrograms/ml doxorubicin (DOX) are 10-fold and > 20-fold resistant to DOX and etoposide (VP-16), respectively. The accumulation of [3H]VP-16 was 2-3-fold lower in the resistant cells (HL-60/DOX 0.05) than in similarly treated parent-sensitive cells (HL-60/S). However, compared with HL-60/S cells, the HL-60/DOX 0.05 cells required > 20-fold higher concentrations of VP-16 to produce equivalent damage to DNA. The reduced formation of VP-16-stabilized DNA cleavable complex in the HL-60/DOX 0.05 cells was not due to differences in the amount of 170-kDa TOPO (alpha) II protein or enzyme catalytic activity between HL-60/S and HL-60/DOX 0.05 cells. Metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and immunoprecipitation indicated that the level of phosphorylated 170-kDa TOPO II alpha protein in the HL-60-/S cells was 2.2 +/- 0.4-fold higher than that in HL-60/DOX 0.05 cells. Hypophosphorylation (3-fold) of 170-kDa TOPO II protein in HL-60/S cells treated with the calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester produced a > 2-fold reduction in VP-16-induced TOPO II-mediated DNA cleavable complex formation. Two-dimensional mapping of phosphopeptides in complete tryptic digests demonstrated that the reduced phosphorylation of the 170-kDa TOPO II alpha in HL-60/DOX 0.05 cells was due to the hypophosphorylation of at least three phosphopeptides characteristic of HL-60/S cells. Thus, the attenuated ability of TOPO II to form drug-stabilized DNA cleavable complex is related to the phosphorylated state of 170-kDa TOPO II, and in HL-60/DOX 0.05 cells, resistance may be related to hypophosphorylation of three phosphopeptides characteristic of HL-60/S cells.","['Ganapathi, R', 'Constantinou, A', 'Kamath, N', 'Dubyak, G', 'Grabowski, D', 'Krivacic, K']","['Ganapathi R', 'Constantinou A', 'Kamath N', 'Dubyak G', 'Grabowski D', 'Krivacic K']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 Aug;50(2):243-8.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']","['CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation may be an option for some, but the need for intensive reinduction chemotherapy regimens remains the best hope for effecting cure in the majority of relapsed children. The authors report the experience of using an intensive chemotherapy protocol (Memorial Sloan-Kettering-New York II Protocol, MSK-NY-II) in a series of relapsed children with ALL. Thirty children presenting to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, in their first relapse of ALL were treated according to a modification of the original MSK-NY-II protocol. Three children (10%) died during induction therapy, two from overwhelming Gram-negative sepsis, and one from intracerebral haemorrhage. Of 27 children completing induction, two children failed to enter remission; however, both had planned deviations from the protocol. Infectious complications were prominent with a total of 55 admissions for febrile neutropenic episodes. Eight children required the support of the intensive care unit for infectious complications. A total of 36 microbiological isolates were obtained from the patients during induction therapy. Ten bone marrow transplant procedures have been subsequently performed in these children, of whom five are alive and disease free at the time of writing. The MSK-NY-II protocol is an intensive regimen but with encouraging early remission rates in relapsed childhood ALL. Early sepsis in previously immunosuppressed children is an important cause of induction death.","['Morland, B J', 'Shaw, P J']","['Morland BJ', 'Shaw PJ']","['Department of Oncology, Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Opportunistic Infections/microbiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199609)27:3<139::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199609)27:3<139::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-F [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 Sep;27(3):139-44. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199609)27:3<139::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-F.,,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'MSK-NY-II protocol, modified']",,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF and LIF also produce differentiation in some cells of the PNS. We have shown previously that CNTF activates the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, and that this signaling pathway may be one of several employed by CNTF to regulate the expression of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene in cells of the PNS (Symes et al.: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:572-576, 1993; Symes et al.: Mol Endocrinol 8:1750-1763, 1994). To investigate the mechanisms of action of CNTF in the CNS, we have analyzed the activation of STAT proteins in a septal-derived cell line, SN48, and in primary CNS cultures. CNTF treatment of SN48 cells produces a sustained activation of Stat3. CNTF treatment of SN48 cells also activated transcription mediated by the VIP cytokine responsive element (CyRE) which contains a STAT binding site. Mutation of the STAT site in the CyRE attenuated transcriptional activation by CNTF, indicating the importance of STAT proteins to CNTF-dependent transcriptional activation of SN48 cells. In cultures of embryonic rat septum and other brain areas, in addition to Stat3, CNTF also activates Stat1. As in cells of the PNS and non-neuronal cells, the Janus kinase (Jak)-STAT pathway is activated in CNS cells by cytokines. The SN48 cell line may be valuable in further characterization of regulation of the Jak-STAT pathway by neuropoietic cytokines.","['Rajan, P', 'Symes, A J', 'Fink, J S']","['Rajan P', 'Symes AJ', 'Fink JS']","['Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*drug effects/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Septum Pellucidum/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*drug effects']",1996/02/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/15 00:00'],"['1996/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19960215)43:4<403::AID-JNR2>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19960215)43:4<403::AID-JNR2>3.0.CO;2-J [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1996 Feb 15;43(4):403-11. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19960215)43:4<403::AID-JNR2>3.0.CO;2-J.,,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",['NS-27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A subsequent study using synchronized cells revealed that the cells at G2/M stage were uniquely sensitive to mutation induction by 252Cf radiation but not so by gamma-rays (Tauchi et al, 1993). We carried out the present study to test the possibility that radiation-induced G2 block may be a major determinant of the inverse dose-rate effect following chronic 252Cf radiation. Growing cell population was first subjected to conditioning gamma or 252Cf radiation with different dose-rates, followed by cell cycle distribution analysis and 252Cf mutagenesis. We found that G2/M fraction increased by 3- to 4-fold when the conditioning doses (2 Gy of gamma or 1 Gy of 252Cf radiation) were delivered chronically over 10 hours but only slightly so when the same doses were delivered for 1 hour or less. Subsequent 252Cf irradiation gave higher mutation frequencies in the cells pre-irradiated with gamma-rays over a protracted period of time than in those with higher dose-rate gamma-rays. These results suggest that radiation-induced G2 block would be at least partly (but can not be totally) responsible for the inverse dose-rate effect.","['Tauchi, H', 'Nakamura, N', 'Komatsu, K', 'Sawada, S']","['Tauchi H', 'Nakamura N', 'Komatsu K', 'Sawada S']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Californium', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis/*radiation effects', 'Neutrons', 'Nuclear Fission', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1269/jrr.37.49 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1996 Mar;37(1):49-57. doi: 10.1269/jrr.37.49.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '975X05H15A (Californium)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow examination revealed 6.6% myeloblasts and 33.5% erythroblasts. Morphological abnormalities included hypersegmentation, degranulation and pseudo-Pelger's nuclear anomaly in neutrophils. Based on these findings the diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was made and therapy with low dose Cytarabine (Ara-C) was initiated in April 1993. The patient had two episodes of severe pneumonia in June and July. Therefore, 75 micrograms/day of G-CSF was given in addition to antibiotic therapy for the second episode of infection in July. Thereafter the severe infection subsided, and G-CSF administration was switched to an intermittent schedule (75 micrograms twice a week) since September. Cytarabine ocfosfate (100 mg/day) was added for 10-14 days at interval 1-2 months from October,1993. He has been well with no episode of infection for more than two year. One major concern regarding the clinical application of G-CSF in MDS patients is related to the possible stimulation of leukemic cell proliferation. Frequent hematological monitoring is necessary in patients with RAEB who are prone to develop acute myeloid leukemia.

The hydrophobic esterified form of TDA (bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2':6',2""-terpyridine-6,6""-dicarboxylate, BATDA) diffuses readily through the cell membrane of viable cells. BATDA is hydrolysed by intracellular esterases resulting in accumulation of membrane impermeable TDA inside the target cells. After incubation of labelled K-562 cells with effector cells the TDA released from lysed cells into the supernatant is chelated with Eu3+. The natural killer cell activity is then quantified by measuring the intense fluorescence of the EuTDA chelates formed. Target cells are rapidly labelled when incubated with BATDA, TDA is released from target cells faster than 51Cr, the spontaneous release permits a short-term release assay to be set up and the detection of EuTDA is fast (5 min/96 well plate).

In this way the specificity of the target-effector cell interaction can be maintained in spite of signalling being mediated by soluble factors (Mosmann, 1988, Immunol. Today 9, 306). However, this polarised phenotype is not expressed in resting T cells; rather it appears to be induced in the first minutes following T cell activation. In order to analyse single molecules for their ability to induce T cell polarisation, we devised a technique based on targeting different T cell surface molecules with specific antibodies immobilised on to immunomagnetic beads. The polarised phenotype was determined from observation of the microtubule organising centre being oriented towards the site of interaction with the bead. When applied to T cell lines, the technique permitted the classification of CD3 as a polarisation-inducing molecule, while no polarisation was found when targeting CD2, CD6 and CD8 molecules. This technique has a number of potential applications since it can, in principle, be applied to any cell surface molecule or cell type.

Prolonged growth of the hybrids with IL-2 resulted in the generation of autonomously growing hybrids (hybridomas) without abrogating the cytotoxic function. The hybridomas exhibited MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner without prior stimulation and also mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Given the importance of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in proliferation and differentiation, we examined the effect of DNIG on several parameters of Friend erythroleukemia cell (FELC) activity. Particular attention was paid to proliferation, hexamethylene-bisacetamide-(HMBA)-induced differentiation, nuclear localization of protein kinase C, and nuclear protein phosphorylation. P-glycoprotein expression was also followed as an indicator of changes in multidrug resistance. At 2.5 microM, DNIG caused a significant decrease in the rate of FELC proliferation, while maintaining a cellular viability of greater than 80%, whether exposure to the drug was continuous over 96 h or took the form of a 6-h pulse/chase. DNA synthesis was decreased in cells exposed to DNIG for 20 h. Flow cytometry showed a marked increase in the percentage of cells in S phase of the cell cycle. Phosphorylation studies revealed decreased phosphorylation of two nuclear proteins (80 kDa and 47 kDa) following a 4-h exposure to the drug. HMBA-induced differentiation was significantly inhibited with continuous exposure to DNIG, and this effect appears to be a pre-commitment one, as 6-h pulse/chase exposures also resulted in inhibition of differentiation. Cells induced to differentiate with HMBA also demonstrated a decrease in the quantity of the 80-kDa phosphoprotein. Western blotting revealed that, even in the face of decreased phosphorylation, exposure to this PKC inhibitor resulted in an increase in the amount of nuclear PKC alpha. Finally, levels of P-glycoprotein were decreased in the presence of this drug. Our work identifies several effects of the PKC inhibitor DNIG on FELC and suggests several roles for PKC in regulating FELC proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, these results suggest that this PKC inhibitor may increase the effect of other chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly S-phase-specific ones, by increasing the length of S phase and decreasing multidrug resistance. The possibility of combination therapy with DNIG and other antineoplastic agents should be investigated further in light of these findings.","['Patterson, K K', 'Beckman, B S', 'Klotz, D M', 'Mallia, C M', 'Jeter, J R Jr']","['Patterson KK', 'Beckman BS', 'Klotz DM', 'Mallia CM', 'Jeter JR Jr']","['Department of Anatomy, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dihydropyridines/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01187158 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1996;122(8):465-75. doi: 10.1007/BF01187158.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'Z81N45O25Z (niguldipine)']",['DK40501/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

MOLT-3/CB3717(40), which was selected for CB3717 resistance, demonstrated impaired membrane drug transport via reduced folate carrier (RFC) and lower accumulation of [3H]ZD1694-polyglutamates in the cells with a shift in the polyglutamate distribution profile to shorter chain length polyglutamates, indicating an alteration in polyglutamation capacity in this subline. Impaired RFC and reduced rate of polyglutamation could explain the cross-resistance (12-fold) of this subline to ZD1694. On the other hand, there was little or no cross-resistance to this drug in a subline (MOLT-3/TMQ800) reportedly resistant to TMQ through impaired membrane transport for TMQ and an increase in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity. Total amount of ZD1694 polyglutamated to a level higher than diglutamate was approximately 1.7-fold higher in the TMQ-resistant cells than that in the parent cells, but a low degree of increase in TS activity in the cells counteracted the supposed increase in sensitivity to ZD1694. MOLT-3/TMQ800-MTX10000 cells, which were established by sequential exposure of the TMQ-resistant cells to MTX and were previously shown to amplify mutated DHFR with low affinity for MTX, showed a decreased accumulation of polyglutamated ZD1694 as compared with the parent line and this was consistent with cross-resistance to ZD1694 in this subline. Overproduction of variant DHFR scarcely influenced the sensitivity to this drug. These results indicate that ZD1694 could overcome antifolate resistance through a mechanism such as amplified DHFR activity, and the biological activity of this drug against the cells paralleled the amount of polyglutamated drug inside the cells. Determination of polyglutamation capacity in tumor cells may allow prediction of sensitivity to this drug.","['Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Miyachi, H', 'Gibson, W', 'Kimbell, R', 'Jackman, A L']","['Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H', 'Gibson W', 'Kimbell R', 'Jackman AL']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis', 'Thiophenes/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0910505096830717 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00291.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1996 Jul;87(7):773-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb00291.x.,PMC5921156,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of the cells with thapsigargin (TG) or 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzodihydroquinone (tBuBHQ), which are the specific and potent Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), showed modest effects on tumoricidal function, whereas TG or tBuBHQ in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed marked effects on tumoricidal function of the cells. The tumoricidal effects of the activated macrophages were correlated with the amount of NO synthesis, and totally abrogated by the use of NOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMA). The increases in NO synthesis was reflected as increased amounts of iNOS mRNA by Northern blotting. To confirm that iNOS induction was due to the changes in the intracellular Ca2+ level, the acetoxymethyl ester of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM), an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, was used. Blocking the increase of cytosolic free Ca2+ significantly decreased the induction of NO synthesis. To demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ acts as a 'priming' signal rather than a 'triggering' signal on the induction of NO synthesis by murine peritoneal macrophages, we designed several experiments. When the cells were treated with TG 6 hr after the treatment with IFN-gamma, there was no increase in NO synthesis. In addition, when the cells were treated with TG or LPS 6 hr after treatment with tBuBHQ, a synergistic increase on NO synthesis was shown only in the case of LPS. When phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, was added to the cells 6 hr after the treatment with TG, there was a marked co-operative induction of NO synthesis, even though PMA alone has no effect. Based on the results obtained in this study, we suggest that cytosolic Ca2+ might be enough for the expression of iNOS gene as a priming signal and PKC might be involved in the induction of NO synthesis as a triggering signal by post-transcriptional modification of iNOS mRNA or iNOS itself in the activated murine peritoneal macrophages.","['Park, Y C', 'Jun, C D', 'Kang, H S', 'Kim, H D', 'Kim, H M', 'Chung, H T']","['Park YC', 'Jun CD', 'Kang HS', 'Kim HD', 'Kim HM', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Medical Resources Research Centre of Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1996.456544.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 1996 Feb;87(2):296-302. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1996.456544.x.,PMC1384288,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Terpenes)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '26XK13B61B (2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The lymphocyte functions (mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and immunoglobulin production in vitro) were equally impaired in all patients with CLL and differed significantly from the respective functions in healthy control subjects. We conclude that impairments in granulocyte functions contribute to susceptibility to infections in CLL.","['Itala, M', 'Vainio, O', 'Remes, K']","['Itala M', 'Vainio O', 'Remes K']","['Turku University Central Hospital, Department of Medicine, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacterial Infections/*immunology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/microbiology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00489.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Jul;57(1):46-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00489.x.,,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that no clonal proliferations were detectable in any of the 43 bone marrow grafts analysed, even after we analysed DNA preparations in 5 cases from cells highly enriched for cells of the original malignant immunophenotype. Moreover, as judged by the Ig- and TCR gene configurations in 11 patients, relapse arose from the original clone even though minor clonal variations did occur in about half of the relapsing patients. We conclude that while the Southern Blot method can detect gene receptor rearrangements in the majority of patients with acute leukaemias and high-grade non-Hodgkins lymphomas, it is not useful for predicting relapse after ABMT. On the other hand, it is possible-by employing it-to evaluate whether or not relapse after ABMT arises from the original malignant clone and to what extent clonal evolution has taken place.","['Jorgensen, H', 'Hokland, P', 'Jensen, A W', 'Hokland, M']","['Jorgensen H', 'Hokland P', 'Jensen AW', 'Hokland M']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00485.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Jul;57(1):25-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00485.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal translocations in AML affect transcription factors that are involved in regulation of myeloid differentiation. Aberrant expression of these factors interferes with differentiation events and has a role in the pathogenesis of AML through superactivation or (dominant negative) repression of genes regulating proliferation and differentiation or by interference with assembly of the transcription complex for these genes. The maturation arrest can be reversed by certain agents as judged by results from investigations of myeloid leukemic cell lines and from treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients with all-trans retinoic acid. Inactivation of the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor genes is also associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia through effects on the cell cycle, and manipulation of these genes can affect differentiation of AML cells. With differentiation therapy, when successful as in APL, the leukemic cell mass is reduced to allow restoration of normal hematopoiesis and clinical remission, but the disease is not cured. However, initial reduction of the cell mass by maturation can increase the probability for cure with chemotherapy. Overexpression of suppressor genes may increase the probability for differentiation. Most probably, particular molecular defects of subgroups of AML have to be explored to find optimal strategies for treatment including both blocking the cell cycle, promoting terminal differentiation, and inducing apoptosis as well as strengthening the immune response.","['Olsson, I', 'Bergh, G', 'Ehinger, M', 'Gullberg, U']","['Olsson I', 'Bergh G', 'Ehinger M', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00483.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1996 Jul;57(1):1-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb00483.x.,,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],,,,122,,,,,,,,

The EH2 domain is located N-terminal of the homeodomain. Two tryptophan residues present in the Drosophila and murine Engrailed EH2 domain are required for cooperativity with extradenticle and Pbx, respectively. A second conserved domain, EH3, is required as well for cooperativity with Pbx, since deletions or an insertion in this region reduce cooperative DNA binding. Peptides containing the Pbx interaction motif of either Engrailed or Hox are capable of destabilizing Engrailed-Pbx and Hox-Pbx cooperative DNA binding.

The primary setting for pharmacokinetic monitoring of MTX is its use in high doses (HDMTX) for adjuvant therapy of osteosarcoma, for single-agent treatment of intracranial lymphomas, and in combination therapy of childhood leukemia as well as adult and pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Typically, HDMTX is infused in doses of 3-15 g/m2 over a period of 6-24 h. Precautions must be taken to ensure a high urine flow and an alkaline urine pH, so as to prevent precipitation of MTX in urine. Patients with decreased renal function, advanced in age, and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or nephrotoxic agents are at increased risk of developing renal dysfunction during MTX infusion, thus being placed at high risk for toxicity. At the end of HDMTX infusion, and periodically thereafter for 24-48 h, drug concentrations are measured to assure that the disappearance rate of MTX from plasma is occurring at a normal rate. Also, at the end of HDMTX infusion, the patient is given leucovorin (5-formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid; LV), which replenishes intracellular stores of reduced folate and attenuates the toxicity secondary to HDMTX. In the presence of inappropriately high concentrations of MTX, routine doses of LV will be ineffective; the dose of LV required must be increased in proportion to the MTX concentration it faces in plasma. In practice, routine monitoring of plasma MTX concentrations allows early detection of abnormal clearance, as well as institution of early and effective countermeasures, including the use of increased and prolonged LV rescue.","['Treon, S P', 'Chabner, B A']","['Treon SP', 'Chabner BA']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 1996 Aug;42(8 Pt 2):1322-9.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,66,,,,,,,,

Subsequent hydroxylation of the deoxyhypusine residue completes hypusine formation on eIF-5A. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) have been implicated in tumor growth and differentiation. Because deoxyhypusine/hypusine formation is one of the most specific polyamine-dependent biochemical events, we decided to use N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7), a potent inhibitor for deoxyhypusine synthase, to assess the role of hypusine formation on tumor growth and differentiation. GC7 suppressed the growth of N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and DS19 murine erythroleukemia cells at micromolar concentrations. However, within a narrow concentration range, GC7 could promote the differentiation of mouse neuroblastoma cells in the presence of suboptimal amount of dibutyryl cAMP. In contrast, GC7 blocked the differentiation of DS19 cells induced with hexamethylene bisacetamide. Polyamine depletion by difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) has previously been shown to promote differentiation of neuroblastoma cells but inhibits erythrodifferentiation. Since our studies demonstrated that GC7 mimics the action of DFMO on tumor differentiation, it is likely that the effect of DFMO on tumor differentiation is mediated by hypusine formation and that GC7 represents a more specific inhibitor that can alter the differentiation program in certain tumor cells.","['Chen, Z P', 'Yan, Y P', 'Ding, Q J', 'Knapp, S', 'Potenza, J A', 'Schugar, H J', 'Chen, K Y']","['Chen ZP', 'Yan YP', 'Ding QJ', 'Knapp S', 'Potenza JA', 'Schugar HJ', 'Chen KY']","['Department of Chemistry, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway 08855-0939, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/*pathology', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/02 00:00,1996/08/02 00:01,['1996/08/02 00:00'],"['1996/08/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304383596042875 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(96)04287-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1996 Aug 2;105(2):233-9. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(96)04287-5.,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N(1)-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.- (deoxyhypusine synthase)']",['CA49695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this investigation the human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CEM) was used to study induction of DNA-strand breaks and cellular drug uptake after treatment with etoposide at a concentration of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml. High performance liquid chromatography was used for determination of etoposide concentrations. The alkaline elution assay and the DNA unwinding technique were compared for quantifying strand breaks in DNA induced by etoposide. The concentrations required to increase the level of DNA damage significantly was as follows: the DNA unwinding technique, 0.20 microgram/ml; the alkaline elution assay with proteinase K, 0.45 microgram/ml; the alkaline elution assay without proteinase K, 0.60 microgram/ml. When the half-life was adjusted, considering the efflux time of etoposide from cells, it was found to be only a few minutes.

The method itself seems promising since neither a donor/recipient sex mismatch nor a cytogenetic disease marker are needed for its application.","['Gosalvez, J', 'Lopez-Fernandez, C', 'Buno, I', 'Polo, N', 'Llamas, P', 'Fernandez, M N', 'Fernandez, J L', 'Diez-Martin, J L']","['Gosalvez J', 'Lopez-Fernandez C', 'Buno I', 'Polo N', 'Llamas P', 'Fernandez MN', 'Fernandez JL', 'Diez-Martin JL']","['Unidad de Genetica, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', '*Transplantation Chimera']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(95)00181-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00181-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Jul 15;89(2):141-5. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00181-6.,,"['EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GATC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Population-based data from nine registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute were analyzed. The analysis was limited to children age < or = 14 years. Cancer cases were restricted to those patients with a malignant neoplasm diagnosed between 1974 and 1991; more than 12,000 children were included. Average annual percentage change in incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated from the maximum likelihood method of Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among children age < or = 14 years there was a 1% average yearly increase (95% CI 0.6, 1.3) in the incidence rates of all malignant neoplasms combined. The average annual percentage change was similar for males and females, and slightly higher for black children compared with white children. Rates increased an average of 2% or more per year for astroglial tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas, germ cell tumors, and osteosarcomas. The average annual percentage change for acute lymphoid leukemia was 1.6% and trends were somewhat stronger for blacks than whites. Cancer trends, in general, were strongest in young children. In particular, increases in astroglial tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas were most apparent among children age < 3 years, and for retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma among children in their first year of life. The average annual percentage change for acute lymphoid leukemia did not vary dramatically with age, however children age < 2 years had stronger trends compared with older children. We found little evidence for increasing trends in Wilms' tumor, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, or hematopoietic neoplasms other than acute lymphoid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cancer occurrence among children within specific histologies increased modestly in the U.S. between 1974 and 1991, and that the increases were most apparent among young children.","['Gurney, J G', 'Davis, S', 'Severson, R K', 'Fang, J Y', 'Ross, J A', 'Robison, L L']","['Gurney JG', 'Davis S', 'Severson RK', 'Fang JY', 'Ross JA', 'Robison LL']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960801)78:3<532::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960801)78:3<532::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Aug 1;78(3):532-41. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960801)78:3<532::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,,['1-CN-05230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Fourteen of these patients were finally evaluated among whom 6 with high risk MDS and 3 with MDS-AML (64.3%) had complete remission, and 2 with high risk MDS (14.3%) achieved partial remission after this chemotherapy for 9 to 21 days. Three of 11 responders were resistant to the prior chemotherapies with single and low dose cytotoxic agents including cytarabine, etoposide, or aclarubicin. Although all of the patients who could be assessed developed severe marrow hypoplasia after chemotherapy, the nonhematologic side effects were mild enough to be tolerated.

Endoscopic evaluation.,396-402,"BACKGROUND: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type I. Gastric lesions in ATLL have not been described precisely, whereas the clinical features of ATLL have been well documented. The goal of the present study was to review gastric lesions, including gastric involvement, of patients with ATLL who were admitted to our hospital. METHODS: Endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract was performed on 76 of 110 patients who were admitted to our hospital between 1981 and 1994. Gastric involvement was diagnosed by histologic examination of biopsy specimens of gastric lesions. Types of gastric lesions, histologic features, and survival periods in patients with ATLL were summarized. RESULTS: Of the 76 patients with ATLL who underwent an endoscopic examination, 23 had gastric involvement (30.3%). Twenty-seven patients had other gastric lesions: 10 with peptic ulcers (13.2%), 8 with gastric erosions (10.5%), 3 with submucosal tumors (3.9%), 2 with hyperplastic polyps (2.6%), 1 with gastric adenoma (1.3%), and 3 with gastric carcinomas (3.9%). The most frequent endoscopic configuration of gastric involvement with ATLL was the diffuse type with ulceration, and the most common histology was large cell type. Among those with the acute type ATLL, the survival period of those patients with gastric involvement was less than that of the patients without gastric involvement. In contrast, the survival period for lymphoma type ATLL did not differ among the groups regardless of gastric involvement. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 30.3% of patients with ATLL had gastric involvement and 13.2% had peptic ulcers. Gastric involvement of ATLL was one of the prognostic factors in acute type ATLL, whereas it had no influence on the prognosis of lymphoma type ATLL.","['Sakata, H', 'Fujimoto, K', 'Iwakiri, R', 'Mizuguchi, M', 'Koyama, T', 'Sakai, T', 'Inoue, E', 'Tokunaga, O', 'Shimamoto, Y']","['Sakata H', 'Fujimoto K', 'Iwakiri R', 'Mizuguchi M', 'Koyama T', 'Sakai T', 'Inoue E', 'Tokunaga O', 'Shimamoto Y']","['Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Female', 'Gastroscopy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptic Ulcer/complications/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Stomach Diseases/*complications/diagnosis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis', 'Survival Rate']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960801)78:3<396::AID-CNCR3>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960801)78:3<396::AID-CNCR3>3.0.CO;2-I [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Aug 1;78(3):396-402. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960801)78:3<396::AID-CNCR3>3.0.CO;2-I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following IFN administration (IFN-alpha frequently in combination with IFN-gamma), there was a decrease in neutrophil granulopoiesis accompanied by a significant expansion of erythroid precursors and increased numbers of hemosiderin-laden macrophages. These changes corresponded with the hematologic response in 21 of the 25 patients investigated. Numbers of megakaryocytes and reticulin/collagen fiber density increased during treatment. Most conspicuously, in responding patients atypical micromegakaryocytes, usually characterizing CML, were partially replaced by normal-sized cells of this lineage. These features are in keeping with the assumption of a reappearance of the normal hematopoietic cell clone as the result of IFN therapy, which was not found in the BU-treated control group. On the other hand, a relevant subpopulation of micromegakaryocytes (about 30%) was still maintained. This result probably relates to the failure to improve myelofibrosis more effectively. Analysis of cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen-PCNA) and apoptosis (in situ end labeling) revealed a reduction in PCNA labeling and increased numbers of cells undergoing programmed death. Identification of the activated subset of macrophages (alpha-D-galactosyl residues expression) by appropriate lectin histochemistry disclosed an increase in the number of GSA-I binding cells. These findings were exclusively limited to IFN administration and reflect an inhibitory effect of IFN on cell proliferation and stimulation of programmed cell death.

Critical care nurses are an integral part of producing the reported cure and remission rates, despite significant complications. In this article, the authors outline the common critical care problems of this patient population. The chronologic format enables the practitioner to correlate and differentiate key characteristics of potential complications.

The rationale for HDC-SCR in breast cancer is based on the principles of dose response and dose intensity. After conventional-dose chemotherapy, hematopoietic progenitor cells are harvested from the bone marrow or peripheral blood. The patient then undergoes HDC-SCR. Peripheral-blood progenitor cells are becoming the preferred cells for hematopoietic rescue. Most clinical trails of HDC-SCR in metastatic breast cancer have resulted in high overall objective response rates (57-100%), with the highest rates occurring in patients with minimal residual disease or chemotherapy-sensitive disease at the time of high-dose treatment. Most protocols now include induction therapy before HDC-SCR; only patients who show sensitive disease proceed to high-dose therapy. In most studies published to date, the median duration of remission was less than one year from the time of high-dose therapy; however, 10-15% of patients achieved complete remissions lasting two or more years. Most patients relapse, however. Some studies have suggested value of HDC-SCR as consolidation therapy in the adjuvant setting for women at high risk of relapse. Short-term toxicities of HDC-SCR are manageable in experienced hands. Notable long-term adverse effects include leukemia, sterility, pulmonary toxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Unresolved issues include the utility of purging occult cancer cells from stem-cell-bearing specimens, the best preparative regimen, the implications of autologous graft-versus-host disease, the use of sequential cycles of high-dose chemotherapy, cost-effectiveness, and effectiveness compared with standard therapy. HDC-SCR appears to be a valid option for selected patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in the adjuvant setting for patients at high risk of recurrence. The cost-benefit profile remains to be defined in randomized trials.","['McCauley, D L']",['McCauley DL'],"['Department of Pharmacy, State University of New York, Stony Brook 11794-7310, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajhp/53.5.521 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 1996 Mar 1;53(5):521-34; quiz 561-2. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/53.5.521.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,87,,,,,,,,

The recipient was a 23-year-old male who was neutropenic following a third cycle of chemotherapy for treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (FAB type M6) and received a 34-day-old red cell unit. During transfusion the patient developed septicaemia and endotoxin-mediated shock. The transfusion was stopped immediately and broad spectrum antibiotics administered immediately on suspicion of bacteraemia from the transfused unit. This prompt action undoubtedly prevented a fatal outcome. Y. enterocolitica was isolated from the blood bag. Antibody was also detected in the bag and in a sample taken from the donor 39 days post-donation. Antibody to serotype 03 was identified, the commonest serotype reported in transfusion-transmitted Y. enterocolitica. The donor reported no gastrointestinal upset or illness prior to donation. This transfusion reaction might not have occurred had the red cells been transfused earlier in their storage period, but would not have been prevented by the exclusion of donors with a history of gastrointestinal illness as the donor was asymptomatic. Nor would it have been prevented by inspecting the blood for a change in colour, as no such change was observed. Y. enterocolitica is a significant problem in transfusion medicine and transmission is generally associated with a high mortality rate.

A hospital survey was performed. Medical records of children under 15 years of age with a diagnosis of acute leukemia were reviewed. The cases were chosen from hospitals which provide medical attention to children with cancer in Mexico City. The annual incidence rate (AIR) was calculated in general, by sex, age groups (under 1 year of age, from 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years and 10 to 14 years) and standardized with the world population. The trend was evaluated with Spearman's correlation method. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed a significantly increasing trend during the study period. The AIR was 7.75 (per million) in 1982 and 22.19 (per million) in 1991. For age groups a tendency to increase was observed in females of age group 1 to 4 years and in males of age group 10 to 14 years. Acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia did not display a specific trend. In conclusion, acute lymphoblastic leukemia shows a tendency to increase in the children of Mexico City.","['Mejia-Arangure, J M', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Bernaldez-Rios, R', 'Farfan-Canto, J M', 'Ortiz-Fernandez, A', 'Martinez-Garcia, M D']","['Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Farfan-Canto JM', 'Ortiz-Fernandez A', 'Martinez-Garcia MD']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico, D.F.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1996 Summer;27(2):223-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with 28 case-matched controls transplanted with HLA identical sibling donors, MUD patients received a more intensive conditioning. Twenty-six patients (93%) engrafted while two died of septicaemia during the aplastic phase. Two patients rejected their grafts and four developed Evans syndrome. All controls engrafted without incidents of rejection or Evans syndrome. The probability of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grade II or above was 27% after MUD-BMT and 7% in the controls. The 5-year probability of survival was 60% in MUD patients and 89% after sibling BMT (p = 0.03). Leukaemia-free survival was 60% with one relapse in the MUD patients, and 59% with five relapses in the sibling group.

The final pathway of apoptosis induction involves a cytoplasmic signal, active at neutral pH, needing magnesium, sensitive to various protease inhibitors and activated directly by staurosporine. Modulators of intracellular signaling (calcium chelators, calmodulin inhibitors, PKC modulators, kinase and phosphatase inhibitors) have no significant influence upon apoptosis induction. Conversely, apoptosis induction pathway is modified during monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells induced by phorbol esters.

Pretreatment of such target cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha but not with interferon (IFN)-alpha or IFN-gamma increased susceptibility of these cells to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Although sphingomyelin (SPM) hydrolysis and ceramide generation may function as an important mediator in TNF alpha signaling, the molecular mechanisms of the signaling pathway(s) are still not well understood. The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of TNF alpha on SPM metabolism and cell growth in two myeloid leukemic cell lines (U937 and KG1a) that differ in their sensitivity to TNF alpha. Our results show that TNF alpha induced apoptosis in U937 but not in KG1a cells. TNF alpha triggered in KG1a cells neither SPM hydrolysis nor ceramide generation, but induced SPM synthesis and ceramide breakdown as well as dose-dependent cell proliferation. In contrast, TNF alpha induced in U937 SPM hydrolysis and ceramide generation as well as dose-dependent cell death. Synthetic cell permeant ceramide, as well as natural ceramide, generated by treatment with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SPMase), all induced apoptosis in both U937 and KG1a cells. These findings indicate that the SPM-ceramide pathway is altered in KG1a cells upstream of the ceramide generation. Analysis of the transverse distribution of SPM in the plasma membrane showed that the SPM pool involved in cell signaling (inner leaflet) was markedly reduced in KG1a cells; it is 7-fold lower than that found in the inner leaflet of U937 cells. Therefore, our study strongly suggests that the different responses induced by TNF alpha in myeloid cells are dependent on the SPM plasma membrane transverse asymmetry.","['Bettaieb, A', 'Record, M', 'Come, M G', 'Bras, A C', 'Chap, H', 'Laurent, G', 'Jaffrezou, J P']","['Bettaieb A', 'Record M', 'Come MG', 'Bras AC', 'Chap H', 'Laurent G', 'Jaffrezou JP']","['CIF INSERM 9503, Centre Claudius Regaud, INSERM Unite 326, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62483-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 15;88(4):1465-72.,,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML gene product has been localized to subnuclear dot-like structures variously termed PODs, ND10s, Kr bodies, or PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). The present study describes the cloning of a lymphoid-restricted gene, LYSP100, that is homologous to another protein that localizes to PML NBs, SP100. In addition to SP100 homology regions, one LYSP100 cDNA isoform contains a bromodomain and a PHD/TTC domain, which are present in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins. By immunofluorescence, LYSP100 was localized to nuclear dots that were surprisingly largely nonoverlapping with PML NBs. However, a minority of LYSP100 nuclear dots exactly colocalized with PML and SP100. We term the LYSP100 structures ""LANDs,"" for LYSP100-associated nuclear domains. Although LYSP100 is expressed only in lymphoid cells, LANDs could be visualized in HeLa cells by transfection of a LYSP100 cDNA. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed LANDs to be globular, electron-dense structures morphologically distinct from the annular structures characteristic of PML NBs. LANDs were most often found in the nucleoplasm, but were also found at the nuclear membrane and in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these structures may traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. By double-immunogold labeling of PML and LYSP100, some LANDs were shown to contain both PML and LYSP100. Thus, PML is localized to a second subnuclear domain that is morphologically and biochemically distinct from PML NBs.","['Dent, A L', 'Yewdell, J', 'Puvion-Dutilleul, F', 'Koken, M H', 'de The, H', 'Staudt, L M']","['Dent AL', 'Yewdell J', 'Puvion-Dutilleul F', 'Koken MH', 'de The H', 'Staudt LM']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62479-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 15;88(4):1423-6.,,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SP140 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,"['GENBANK/U36499', 'GENBANK/U36500', 'GENBANK/U36501']",,,,,,,,,,

PNA was also able to successfully compete with anti-P/R DNA for duplex formation with P/R DNA and to displace the anti-P/R DNA from dsDNA. In vitro transcribed P/R RNA from two inserts of approximately 350 to approximately 700 bp were tested in gel acceleration experiments with fluorescein-conjugated PNA and showed stable binding (resistant to denaturing conditions) of PNA to the newly transcribed RNA. Control RNA or transcripts from the noncoding strand did not bind PNA. However, this PNA, although able to specifically clamp polymerase chain reaction, was incapable of inhibiting in vitro translation of the PML/RAR alpha mRNA, even when a bis-PNA was used. Therefore, a PNA was targeted against the start region of the P/R cDNA and against poly-purine regions of the gene.

ATRA was administered orally beginning on the first day of induction at the dosage of 45 mg/m2/d until complete remission (CR), whereas IDA was administered intravenously at the dosage of 12 mg/m2/d on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the induction. Patients who achieved CR were consolidated with 3 courses of chemotherapy without ATRA; thereafter, they were followed up for molecular and hematologic CR. The median age was 35.3 years (range, 6.5 to 67.6 years); 8 patients were males and 12 females; 4 had the hypogranular variant of APL (M3v), and 4 (2 with M3v) presented with leukocyte counts > or = 10,000/microL. Molecular analysis for the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RAR alpha) hybrid gene at diagnosis was performed in 16 patients by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, and all were RT-PCR+ for the hybrid gene. In the remaining 4 patients, the cytogenetic study showed the presence of the t(15;17). After a median time of 36 days (range, 28 to 52 days) 18 (90%) patients achieved CR; the remaining 2 patients died 12 and 34 days after diagnosis from myocardial infarction caused by fungal myocarditis and from massive hemoptysis, respectively. ATRA syndrome was observed in only 2 patients, and, after the prompt discontinuation of ATRA and initiation of dexamethasone, both recovered from the syndrome. However, after recovering, 1 patient achieved CR, whereas the other died at day 34 because of massive hemoptysis; other side effects were very limited. At recovery from the third consolidation course, only 3 of 14 (21.4%) tested patients were RT-PCR+ for the PML-RAR alpha hybrid gene. Of these, 2 relapsed shortly afterwards; however, in the last patient, the PML-RAR alpha disappeared at successive testing performed 2 months later. As of September 30, 1995, after a median follow-up period from diagnosis of 27 months (range, 24 to 31 months), the overall survival and event-free survival durations are 85% and 69%, respectively; moreover, 14 of 18 (78%) patients who achieved CR are still alive and in first molecular and hematologic CR. Of the 4 relapsed patients, 3 achieved a second CR with ATRA and, after further treatment, are now in molecular and hematologic CR after 4+, 16+, and 17+ months from the second CR. These results indicate that (1) the AIDA protocol is highly effective in treating APL; (2) after 3 consolidation courses, the majority of patients who achieved CR are RT-PCR- for the hybrid gene PML-RAR alpha; (3) the persistence of an RT-PCR positivity for the PML-RAR alpha hybrid gene after 3 consolidation courses is indicative of early relapse, thus these patients still require additional treatment. These results have prompted the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) to initiate, in cooperation with the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica and some European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) centers, a new multicentric clinical trial named AIDA LAP 0493 for the treatment of adult and pediatric APL patients. All patients are considered eligible if APL diagnosis is confirmed with molecular or cytogenetic studies for PML-RAR alpha hybrid gene or t(15;17) and are enrolled to receive the same induction and consolidation therapy of this pilot study. After consolidation, patients who are RT-PCR- for PML-RAR alpha hybrid gene are randomized to four arms, whereas patients who are RT-PCR+ after consolidation undergo, if eligible, an allogenic transplantation procedure.","['Avvisati, G', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Diverio, D', 'Falda, M', 'Ferrara, F', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Russo, D', 'Petti, M C', 'Mandelli, F']","['Avvisati G', 'Lo Coco F', 'Diverio D', 'Falda M', 'Ferrara F', 'Lazzarino M', 'Russo D', 'Petti MC', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia Umana, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Pilot Projects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62474-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 15;88(4):1390-8.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells expressed abundant CD38 (relative fluorescence intensity range, 6 to 15) in 6 cases (group I patients), whereas CD38 expression was low to absent (relative fluorescence intensity range, 0 to 3) in the remaining cases (group II patients). Exposure of the cells from group I patients to goat antihuman mu chain antibodies (Ga mu-ab) resulted in the elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration([Ca2+]i) followed by apoptosis. In contrast, exposure of group II cells to Ga mu-ab was not followed by increased levels of [Ca2+]i, programmed cell death or cell proliferation. No differences in the expression of surface IgM were noted in the two groups of B-CLL cells. Normal peripheral blood B cells, which expressed low to absent CD38, were capable of mobilizing [Ca2+]i and of proliferating after exposure to Ga mu-ab. The collected data suggest that, although group I B-CLL cells were able to transduce the signals delivered by IgM crosslinking, this pathway was severely impaired in group II B-CLL cells. However, unlike that observed in normal circulating B cells, stimulation of group I cells with Ga mu-ab resulted in apoptosis rather than proliferation. CD38 did not appear to be directly involved in [Ca2+]i mobilization induced by Ga mu-ab in group I B-CLL cells because their exposure to anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies failed to cause [Ca2+]i mobilization or to block the [Ca2+]i response induced by Ga mu-ab. These data indicate that CD38 expression identified a particular subset of B-CLL cells with defined functional properties, including the propensity to undergo apoptosis.","['Zupo, S', 'Isnardi, L', 'Megna, M', 'Massara, R', 'Malavasi, F', 'Dono, M', 'Cosulich, E', 'Ferrarini, M']","['Zupo S', 'Isnardi L', 'Megna M', 'Massara R', 'Malavasi F', 'Dono M', 'Cosulich E', 'Ferrarini M']","['Servizio di Immunologia Clinica, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*physiology', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62471-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 15;88(4):1365-74.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,['Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):2277-8.

The rationale of the study was based on the negative prognostic value of MDR phenotype in ALs and the ability of quinine to reverse this phenotype both in vitro and ex vivo. Three hundred fifteen patients (median age, 49 years; range, 16 to 65) with relapsed (n = 108) or refractory (n = 32) acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), relapsed (n = 27) or refractory (n = 9) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), secondary AL (n = 22) or blastic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome ([MDS] n = 74) or myeloproliferative syndrome ([MPS] n = 43) were randomly assigned to receive mitoxantrone ([MXN] 12 mg/m2/d, days 2 to 5) and cytarabine ([Ara-C] 1 g/m2/12 h, days 1 to 5) alone or in combination with quinine (30 mg/kg/d, days 1 to 5; continuous intravenous infusion beginning 24 hours before MXN infusion). Side effects of quinine were observed in 56 of 161 quinine-treated patients and disappeared in all but four cases after one or two 20% dose decreases. Sera from quinine-treated patients showed increased MXN uptake in an MDR-positive cell line compared with matched sera obtained before quinine infusion. Quinine induced a significant increase in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and cardiac toxicity. A complete response (CR) was observed in 85 of 161 patients (52.8%) from the quinine-treated group versus 70 of 154 patients (45.5%) in the control group (P = .19). The most important differences between quinine and control group CR rates were observed in patients with refractory AMLs and blastic transformation of MDS and MPS. The CR rate was higher in P-glycoprotein-positive cases, although the difference was not significant. Failure of the regimen due to blastic persistence or blast number increase was higher in the control group (61 of 154 patients) than in the quinine group (45 of 161, P = .04). Early death was observed in eight cases (four in each arm) and death in aplasia in 27 cases (20 in quinine group v seven in control group, P = .01). The significant increase of toxicity in the quinine arm could have masked the clinical benefit of MDR reversion in poor-risk ALs.","['Solary, E', 'Witz, B', 'Caillot, D', 'Moreau, P', 'Desablens, B', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Sadoun, A', 'Pignon, B', 'Berthou, C', 'Maloisel, F', 'Guyotat, D', 'Casassus, P', 'Ifrah, N', 'Lamy, Y', 'Audhuy, B', 'Colombat, P', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Solary E', 'Witz B', 'Caillot D', 'Moreau P', 'Desablens B', 'Cahn JY', 'Sadoun A', 'Pignon B', 'Berthou C', 'Maloisel F', 'Guyotat D', 'Casassus P', 'Ifrah N', 'Lamy Y', 'Audhuy B', 'Colombat P', 'Harousseau JL']","['Clinical Hematology Unit, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Le Bocage, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage', 'Quinine/*administration & dosage']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62453-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Aug 15;88(4):1198-205.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-two of 165 related-donor recipients with stable or advanced disease at the time of transplant had hematologic relapse of CML following transplant (5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse, 20%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11 to 30%). One of 12 patients transplanted in second stable phase following blast crisis also relapsed. Fifteen related-donor transplant recipients relapsed within 5 years of transplant; however, seven relapsed between 5 and 9 years after transplant. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of posttransplant relapse for related-donor recipients included prolonged interval between diagnosis and transplant (relative risk, [RR], 3.81; P = .009) and bone marrow basophilia (RR, 5.62; P = .01). Related-donor recipients with posttransplant chronic graft-versus-host disease (CGVHD) had a decreased risk of relapse (RR, 0.24; P = .005). Only two of 106 unrelated-donor transplant recipients relapsed following transplant (5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse, 3%; 95% CI, 0% to 7%). When both related- and unrelated-donor recipients were considered, the use of an unrelated donor was independently associated with a decreased risk of relapse (RR, 0.24; P = .07). Twelve of 16 relapsing patients who received further therapy (nine of 13 who underwent second transplant and three of three who received donor leukocyte infusions) remain alive. This analysis shows that relapse, sometimes occurring long after transplant, is an important adverse outcome in allogeneic transplantation for CML. Early transplant, posttransplant CGVHD, and use of an unrelated donor are associated with a reduced incidence of relapse, perhaps due to allogeneic disparities enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Enright, H', 'Davies, S M', 'DeFor, T', 'Shu, X', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Miller, W', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Arthur, D', 'Verfaillie, C', 'Miller, J', 'Kersey, J', 'McGlave, P']","['Enright H', 'Davies SM', 'DeFor T', 'Shu X', 'Weisdorf D', 'Miller W', 'Ramsay NK', 'Arthur D', 'Verfaillie C', 'Miller J', 'Kersey J', 'McGlave P']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63591-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 15;88(2):714-20.,,,"['CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49271/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IPOICA65493-0I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

A new analogue less affected by p-gp is annamycin (ANN), an anthracycline antibiotic with high affinity for lipid membranes and significantly more activity than doxorubicin (DOX). We investigated whether ANN was affected by p-gp-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) by comparing the cellular accumulation and retention of ANN, idarubicin (IDR), and DOX in the p-gp-negative human leukemia cell lines (HL-60S) and its DOX-selected p-gp-positive subline (HL-60/DOX) with and without verapamil (VER). As expected, HL-60/DOX cells showed lower DOX uptake than HL-60S cells; coincubation with VER (10 mmol/L) increased uptake 2.6-fold restoring it to 100% of uptake in HL-60S cells. IDR uptake increased 1.5-fold in the presence of VER, but ANN was not affected. Coincubation with VER increased DOX retention in HL-60/DOX cells 2.8-fold and IDR retention 1.4-fold; unchanged ANN retention indicated that ANN may overcome p-gp. In the cytotoxicity assay to correlate intracellular anthracycline content with antitumor activity, we found ANN to be less potent than DOX and IDR In sensitive cells, ID 50 being the drug concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50% but its resistance index (RI; ID50 resistant cells divided by ID50 sensitive cells) was lower than that of IDR and DOX (2.6 v 40 and 117.5). Coincubation in the presence of VER resulted in 4.5-fold and 2-fold RI decreases of DOX and IDR, respectively, whereas ANN did not change, further confirming ANN's ability to circumvent p-gp-mediated MDR. Confocal microscopy studies of IDR, ANN, and DOX showed higher intracellular drug compartmentalization for DOX in HL-60/DOX cells incubated in the presence of VER. This study provided evidence that, unlike DOX and IDR, ANN is not affected by p-gp-mediated MDR.","['Consoli, U', 'Priebe, W', 'Ling, Y H', 'Mahadevia, R', 'Griffin, M', 'Zhao, S', 'Perez-Soler, R', 'Andreeff, M']","['Consoli U', 'Priebe W', 'Ling YH', 'Mahadevia R', 'Griffin M', 'Zhao S', 'Perez-Soler R', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63582-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 15;88(2):633-44.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SNU299M83Q (annamycin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']","['CA50270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleotide sequence analysis has shown predominantly different V(H)DJ(H) junctions among these genes, leading to the frequent description of such cases as oligoclonal leukemias. In the present study, we have analyzed the lgH genes from four patients whose leukemic cells contained different patterns of lgH gene rearrangements between presentation and relapse. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the lgH genes showed that three mechanisms could account for these differences: de novo V(H)DJ(H) rearrangement, V(H) to DJ(H) recombination, and V(H) replacement. In all cases, more than two totally different V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements appeared during evolution of the disease, formally consistent with the conclusion that these tumors were composed of apparently unrelated clones. However, the retention of some of the antigen receptor gene rearrangements, as well as the persistence of a chromosomal marker in two cases, indicated that these leukemias had a monoclonal origin. These findings support the hypothesis that some ALLs arise from a lymphoid progenitor cell at a stage of lymphocyte development before the onset of IgH gene rearrangement. These leukemic lymphocyte progenitors generate malignant daughter cells capable of an in vivo maturation that involves the completion of multiple different lgH rearrangements as well as the modification of preexisting rearrangements by V(H) to DJ(H) recombination or by a V(H) replacement.","['Davi, F', 'Gocke, C', 'Smith, S', 'Sklar, J']","['Davi F', 'Gocke C', 'Smith S', 'Sklar J']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63580-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 15;88(2):609-21.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']","['P01 CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA38621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

During myelopoiesis, GM-CSF induces the proliferation of precursors and has multiple effects on more mature cells; such effects include induction of maturation and priming for subsequent stimulation. GMR is expressed on a range of other cell types including acute leukemic blasts of myeloid and lymphoid lineage, but has been little studied on more mature lymphoid cells. Using sensitive triple-layer immunophenotypic techniques, we show here that both the alpha and beta c chains of the GMR are expressed on hairy cells (HCs) and myelomatous plasma cells (PCs), but not on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) lymphocytes. The receptor was demonstrable on normal PCs in tonsil, but not on either activated or resting tonsillar B cells or on circulating normal B lymphocytes. The expression of the receptor is therefore stage specific, rather than a feature of activation. Perhaps, surprisingly, in view of its effects on myeloid cells, GM-CSF did not stimulate the proliferation or differentiation of HCs and did not protect them from apoptosis. However, the cytokine had a profound effect on the interaction of the HC with its environment. Thus, the cytokine caused a major cytoskeletal reorganization resulting in the inhibition of motility and loss of adhesion to cellular and matrix ligands. These studies indicate the importance of GM-CSF outside myelopoiesis and demonstrate a previously unrecognized stage specific role for the cytokine in B-cell biology. Taken together with our previous report that M-CSF enhances B-cell motility, the present findings indicate that myeloid growth factors act in concert to facilitate the controlled migration of certain B cells into and within tissues.","['Till, K J', 'Burthem, J', 'Lopez, A', 'Cawley, J C']","['Till KJ', 'Burthem J', 'Lopez A', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/blood/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63566-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jul 15;88(2):479-86.,,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood tumours tend to have their origin in intrinsic genetic abnormalities, and are usually disseminated by the time of diagnosis. As a result, conventional treatments, such as ablative surgery and/or radiotherapy (the effects of which are detrimental to the growth and development of normal tissues), are rarely successful. The advent of effective combination chemotherapy, given as an adjuvant to eradicate micrometastases, has led also to the dramatic regression of inoperable primary tumours. Subsequent surgery often enables complete resection without the need for radiotherapy. Primary surgery is now used to obtain sufficient tissue to make a precise diagnosis, and recently developed molecular techniques make this possible with great precision from needle biopsies in many instances. The development of an effective treatment regimen is the single most important prognostic factor. This also permits analysis of the differences between successfully treated groups and those not cured by standard treatment. These prognostic factors usually have a biological basis that is identifiable at diagnosis, allowing stratification of treatments and further development. Some of the worst prognosis cases on past standard therapy, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, have an excellent prognosis when specific treatment regimens are designed to fit their particular characteristics. The finding of specific genetic mutations underlying many childhood tumours may now provide an 'Achilles heel' to enable the development of highly specific therapies that are relatively non-toxic to the normal tissues undergoing rapid growth and development during childhood. The rarity of childhood cancer and the need for multidisciplinary management make it impossible for the ordinary district hospital to deliver optimal treatment, though 'maintenance' treatment and follow-up can be delivered locally as part of 'shared care' with a regional centre. These centres are members of the U.K. Children's Cancer Study Group which was formed in 1977 and now treats 75%. of all cases of childhood malignancy, with sufficient numbers to run randomized clinical trials for most tumour types, often in collaboration with other national paediatric oncology groups in Europe and the U.S.A. CONCLUSION: Children with cancer are likely to be major beneficiaries from the recent advances in the understanding of neoplasia, many of which stem from work on paediatric malignancies. It is therefore important and mutually advantageous to foster and maintain close links with mainstream 'adult' oncology and with the cancer research institutions.","['Mott, M G']",['Mott MG'],"['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Institute of Child Health, Bristol, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/etiology', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Wilms Tumor/mortality']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annonc/6.suppl_1.s3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995;6 Suppl 1:3-8; discussion 8-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/6.suppl_1.s3.,,,,,,42,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that DACA induces DNA cleavage in the presence of topoisomerase I as well as of topoisomerase II. We also investigate a series of acridine derivatives which link amsacrine to DACA in terms of DNA binding, topoisomerase poisoning and biological activity. The presence of an acridine 4-linked N-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl group provides both a pronounced G-C preference for DNA binding and activity towards topoisomerase I. The removal of the anilino side chain of amsacrine, in combination with the presence of the N-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl group, provides in vitro biological activity against ""atypical"" multidrug resistant leukaemia lines with low topoisomerase II activity. Among these compounds, suppression of the ionisation of the acridine nitrogen to produce the compound DACA is associated with experimental activity against solid tumours. The addition of an acridine 2-chloro substituent to DACA suppresses the stimulation of topoisomerase II-dependent DNA cleavage but increases stimulation of topoisomerase I cleavage. 2-Substitution also increases activity against the ""atypical"" multidrug resistant cell lines. Overall, the results suggest that augmentation of topoisomerase I-dependent activity in this series by appropriate chemical substitution in this series leads to circumvention of topoisomerase II-mediated multidrug resistance.","['Finlay, G J', 'Riou, J F', 'Baguley, B C']","['Finlay GJ', 'Riou JF', 'Baguley BC']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Acridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00604-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00604-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 Apr;32A(4):708-14. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00604-4.,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', ""89459-25-6 (N-(2'-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality from all neoplasms in the elderly showed heterogeneous patterns in various countries and in the two sexes. Trends were generally more favourable for females than for males, reflecting essentially the earlier and more extensive impact of the lung cancer (and other tobacco-related neoplasms) epidemic in elderly males, in addition to the earlier decline of gastric cancer and a widespread decline of cervical cancer rates in females. In several countries, particularly from western Europe, but also Japan, cancer mortality trends were more favourable over the last two decades than in earlier calendar periods. Some countries of northern and central Europe (including Finland, Germany, Austria and Switzerland) showed stable or even downward trends over time for total cancer mortality in both sexes, particularly in males. This reflects the different patterns of the tobacco-related (lung) cancer epidemic in various countries, and the impact of a few other major neoplasms, including in particular the systematic downward trends in stomach cancer. In contrast, rates were moderately upwards in males in North America, and several countries of southern and eastern Europe, where cancer mortality in the elderly was comparatively low in the 1950s, showed appreciable upward trends, mostly in males. Thus, there was a generalised tendency towards a levelling of the differences in certified cancer mortality in the elderly population in various areas of the world. Although there are substantial limits and uncertainties in the reliability and validity of cancer death certification and their trends in the elderly, there is no widespread and generalised upward trend in cancer mortality, with a major exception of lung and other tobacco-related neoplasms. Furthermore, in several countries, cancer mortality trends over the last four decades have been favourable for elderly women.","['Levi, F', 'La Vecchia, C', 'Lucchini, F', 'Negri, E']","['Levi F', 'La Vecchia C', 'Lucchini F', 'Negri E']","['Institut universitaire de medecine sociale et preventive, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/mortality', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/mortality', 'Sex Distribution', 'Skin Neoplasms/mortality', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/mortality']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00582-X [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00582-x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 Apr;32A(4):652-72. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00582-x.,,,,,,,,['Eur J Cancer. 1996 Apr;32A(4):569-71.

Involvement of Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition in the early changes in proto-oncogene expression.",321-9,"Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by treatment with cardiotonic steroid bufalin, which was previously shown to interact with the Na+, K+-ATPase with similar kinetics to ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. This induction of differentiation was characterized by loss of proliferation, cell adherence, increased ability to reduce Nitro Blue tetrazolium (NBT), and increased expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). During this process, bufalin downregulated c-myb and c-myc expressions and induced c-fos and Egr-1 transcripts. Ouabain also caused similar changes in proto- oncogene expression and induced phenotypic markers of differentiated cells at concentrations comparable to bufalin. The 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate resistant THP-1 cell variant, which was unresponsive to this agent as to growth inhibition and proto-oncogene expression, responded to bufalin. The finding that protein kinase inhibitor H7 failed to bufalin-mediated c-fos induction further supports the theory that the signal transduction machinery caused by bufalin is separable from the phorbol ester. The cytotoxic effect of high doses of bufalin apparently disappeared in the medium where Na+ was replaced with choline ions. Furthermore, bufalin failed to induce c-fos expression and to downregulate c-myb transcripts in the low-Na+ medium. These findings indicate that an increased intracellular Na+ concentration resulting from the Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition possibly triggers the change in proto-oncogene expression evoked by bufalin.","['Numazawa, S', 'Inoue, N', 'Nakura, H', 'Sugiyama, T', 'Fujino, E', 'Shinoki, M', 'Yoshida, T', 'Kuroiwa, Y']","['Numazawa S', 'Inoue N', 'Nakura H', 'Sugiyama T', 'Fujino E', 'Shinoki M', 'Yoshida T', 'Kuroiwa Y']","['Department of Biochemical Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/07/26 00:00,1996/07/26 00:01,['1996/07/26 00:00'],"['1996/07/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006295296002109 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00210-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Jul 26;52(2):321-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00210-9.,,"['0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern and western blot analysis showed little or no hsp28 gene expression in the HL-60 cell variant, HL-205, which is susceptible to such differentiation, while a relatively high basal level of hsp28 gene expression was observed in the HL-525 cells. However, both cell lines demonstrated heat shock-induced expression of this gene. During treatment with 50-300 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, a marked reduction of hsp28 gene expression along with an induction of PKC beta gene expression was observed in HL-525 cells. A gel mobility-shift assay demonstrated that the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced alteration of hsp28 gene expression was associated with decreased binding activity to the vitamin D3 receptor-vitamin D3 response element (VDR-VDRE), whereas binding to the heat shock transcription factor-heat shock element (HSF-HSE) was not altered. Our results suggest that the dual effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on hsp28 and PKC beta gene expression is due to the different sequence composition of the vitamin D response element in the promoter region as well as an accessory factor for each gene or that 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases PKC beta gene expression, which, in turn, negatively regulates the expression of the hsp28 gene or vice versa.","['Lee, Y J', 'Galoforo, S S', 'Berns, C M', 'Blackburn, R V', 'Huberman, E', 'Corry, P M']","['Lee YJ', 'Galoforo SS', 'Berns CM', 'Blackburn RV', 'Huberman E', 'Corry PM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI 48073, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HSP30 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/07/26 00:00,1996/07/26 00:01,['1996/07/26 00:00'],"['1996/07/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00209-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00209-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Jul 26;52(2):311-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00209-2.,,"['0 (HSP30 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['CA44550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced nbl expression therefore appears to be associated with apoptosis which is either blocked or induced by actinomycin D.","['Naora, H', 'Nishida, T', 'Shindo, Y', 'Adachi, M', 'Naora, H']","['Naora H', 'Nishida T', 'Shindo Y', 'Adachi M', 'Naora H']","['Research School of Biological Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Amnion', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/*physiology']",1996/07/05 00:00,1996/07/05 00:01,['1996/07/05 00:00'],"['1996/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)91017-7 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.1017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Jul 5;224(1):258-64. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1017.,,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This receptor, chemically cross-linked to its possible ligands, migrates, in SDS PAGE, slower than the uPA-R expressed on the epithelial thyroid cell line TAD-2, cross-linked to the same ligands. The different migration corresponds to a difference in molecular weight of 15 kDa. Similar results were obtained with peripheral monocytes and primary cultures of thyroid cells. The molecular weight of the native receptor is about 50 kDa and appears to be identical in these two cell types. Such results suggest that, in monocytic cells, uPA-R associates to a 15 kDa molecule. This molecule is probably linked to the cell surface by a glyco-phospho-inositol anchor since, by phospholipase-C treatment, it is co-eluted with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor from THP-1 cells.","['Ragno, P', 'Montuori, N', 'Rossi, G']","['Ragno P', 'Montuori N', 'Rossi G']","['Centro di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale (CEOS), Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Carcinoma, Papillary', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Monocytes', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Succinimides', 'Thyroid Gland/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms', 'Type C Phospholipases', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1996/07/05 00:00,1996/07/05 00:01,['1996/07/05 00:00'],"['1996/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)91016-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.1016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Jul 5;224(1):252-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1016.,,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Succinimides)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'V9WYZ7QMDT (disuccinimidyl suberate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified that a cytotoxic substance of Korean snake venom which is responsible for the apoptosis is L-amino acid oxidase (LAO). The purified enzyme is a homodimeric glycoprotein of 110,000 and is capable of generating H2O2 by catalyzing oxidation of L-amino acid. In the presence of the enzyme, cultured L1210 cell nuclei were splitted and showed the characteristic ladder-like pattern of DNA fragmentation. The enzyme binds directly to the cell surface, thereby increasing local concentration of H2O2. However, experimental evidence suggests that the LAO-induced apoptotic mechanism is distinguished from the one caused by exogenous H2O2.","['Suhr, S M', 'Kim, D S']","['Suhr SM', 'Kim DS']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Amino Acid Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Crotalid Venoms/chemistry/*toxicity', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'L-Amino Acid Oxidase', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Spleen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/05 00:00,1996/07/05 00:01,['1996/07/05 00:00'],"['1996/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)90996-1 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0996 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Jul 5;224(1):134-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0996.,,"['0 (Agkistrodon venoms)', '0 (Crotalid Venoms)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.4.- (Amino Acid Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.4.3.2 (L-Amino Acid Oxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies confirmed our previous observation that the 31P spectra of sera of patients with acute leukemia and malignant lymphomas revealed a significant decrease in the phospholipid level at the time of diagnosis and displayed a good correlation between spectral parameters and stage of disease in patients responding and non-responding to therapy. Contrary to the preliminary studies, peaks from PE + SM and PC, and also a peak from LPC were observed. Changes in phospholipids in the 31P NMR spectra observed in patients suffering from digestive tract tumors and renal cell carcinoma were primarily dependent on the advance of the disease. Most of our patients with these cancers were in the early stage of the disease, and the spectra showed statistically significant decrease only in the LPC peak area, and no statistically significant changes of peak areas of PC and PE+SM in comparison to the control group. In conclusion, we can state that the LPC peak area is the most sensitive indicator in the monitoring of treatment in acute leukemia and malignant lymphomas. Our results also showed that LPC peak areas were decreased in the early stages of digestive tract tumors and a renal cell carcinoma.","['Kuliszkiewicz-Janus, M', 'Janus, W', 'Baczynski, S']","['Kuliszkiewicz-Janus M', 'Janus W', 'Baczynski S']","['Department of Haematology, Wroclaw University of Medicine, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*blood', 'Phospholipids/*blood']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 May-Jun;16(3B):1587-94.,,['0 (Phospholipids)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased levels of these compounds characterize cell lines of different origin transformed by ras and other oncogenes.

In particular, glycerophosphoinositol-4-phosphate (GroPIns4P) is an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase that acts on the Gs protein. Since GroPIns4P is formed physiologically upon hormone stimulation in several cell lines including fibroblasts, thyrocytes, neuronal and leukemia cells, we propose that GroPIns4P could act as a second messenger able to mediate a cross-talk between the ras cascade and adenylyl cyclase.","['Corda, D', 'Falasca, M']","['Corda D', 'Falasca M']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Endocrinology, Santa Maria Imbaro (Chieti), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases/physiology', 'Second Messenger Systems/*physiology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 May-Jun;16(3B):1341-50.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '16824-65-0 (glycerylphosphoinositol)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)']",,,,86,,,,,,,,

One of the mechanisms of development of anaemia in tumours are so-called chronic diseases anaemias, the main feature of which is inadequate production of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO). The objective of the investigation was to test the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in the treatment of anaemia (rise of haematocrit, Hb) in patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) and the effect of this treatment on the quality of life. The authors evaluated at the same time the impact of the endogenous EPO level before treatment and its predictive value as regards the therapeutic response. PATIENTS: The investigation comprised a total of 14 patients (6 CLL, 8 MM). The basic criterion for inclusion in the group was a Ht value lower than 0.32 and Hb less than 105 g/l. The examination protocol was focused on elimination of other causes of anaemia. During the 12-week investigation the patients completed a questionnaire ""Quality of life"" which reflected their subjective evaluation of the effect of treatment. The patients themselves administered r-HuEPO three times a week by the s.c. route--an initial dose of 150 U/kg with the possibility to increase the dose to 300 U/kg. RESULTS: A therapeutic response was obtained in four patients with CLL and eight patients with MM. Respondents with CLL had endogenous EPO values lower than 300 U/l, seven MM respondents lower than 200 U/l, one 400 U/l. The Hb level of the patients rose and the quality of life improved. All patients tolerated treatment very well and the authors did not observe any serious undesirable effects. CONCLUSION: The investigation confirmed the therapeutic effect of r-HuEPO in patients with a lower baseline value of EPO. Subjective evaluation (questionnaire) correlated with objective evaluation (Ht, Hb). Assessment of the endogenous EPO level before treatment is according to the authors one of the important primary predictive parameters and EPO values between 200 and 300 U/l are the upper range where a therapeutic effect can be expected with the highest probability. The authors conclude also that a secondary predictive criterion of the response is evaluation of the therapeutic effect after 4-5 weeks treatment when a rise of Hb by at least 20 g/l is an argument for further treatment.","['Haber, J', 'Spicka, I', 'Petruzelka, L', 'Koleskova, E', 'Straub, J', 'Jonasova, A', 'Pospisilova, B']","['Haber J', 'Spicka I', 'Petruzelka L', 'Koleskova E', 'Straub J', 'Jonasova A', 'Pospisilova B']","['II.

This long latent period is characteristic of 'persistent virus infections'. Disease produced by LLV infection and its underlying mechanisms is compared with 'persistent' infections caused by other retroviruses in birds and mammals of veterinary importance. The diseases considered for comparison are those caused by reticuloendotheliosis, feline leukaemia, bovine leukosis and equine infectious anaemia viruses. There are significant changes in the immunological status in all diseases caused by these viruses. LLV infections follow this trend with, in manifestations of neoplastic disease, a perturbation of the normal switch that occurs from IgM to IgG synthesis. There are also indications of other immunological disturbances. Factors other than immunological disturbances may contribute to the length of time after infection required for the many forms of LLV infection to appear. Such additional factors may include the operation of 'biological clocks', such as the arrival of sexual maturity, and also the very nature of retroviruses. These factors, like the immunological changes, play major roles in the maintenance and progression of persistent retrovirus infections.","['Darcel, C']",['Darcel C'],"['Palliser Animal Health Laboratories Ltd, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Res Commun,Veterinary research communications,8100520,IM,"['*Alpharetrovirus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Birds', 'Cats', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Equine Infectious Anemia/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', '*Reticuloendotheliosis virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00346580 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Res Commun. 1996;20(1):83-108. doi: 10.1007/BF00346580.,,,,,,112,,,,,,,,

We evaluated sIL-6R and IL-6 levels in the sera of 24 patients following transplantation (allogeneic, n=17; autologous, n=7). Five patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD), three had early graft rejection, and three had an early relapse following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Soluble IL-6R levels were evaluated at day - 10, day 0, day of engraftment, and during BMT-related complications, using IL-6R-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and double-sandwich ELISA. In normal controls, sIL-6R and IL-6 levels were 20+/-3 ng/ml and 0.01+/-0.005 ng/ml, respectively. Soluble IL-6R levels increased in direct correlation with engraftment in the uneventful allogeneic transplants (17.7+/-2.1 ng/ml at day 0 to 49.7+/-2.6 ng/ml at day of engraftment, n=6, P<0.05) as well as in the autologous transplants (26.8+/-2.82 at day 0 to 66.4+/-12.9 at day of engraftment, n=5, P=0.01). In contrast, IL-6 levels declined with time during the conditioning period and showed only a modest elevation following BMT. Increased levels of sIL-6R and IL-6 were found in the patients who developed AGVHD (23.8+/-4.2 and 0+/-0 ng/ml at day 0 to 79+/-6.9 and 0.26+/-0.04 ng/ml, respectively, at time of AGVHD, n=5, P=0.01). No correlation was found between the severity of AGVHD and sIL-6R levels. In the three patients with early relapse, sIL-6R levels increased from 30+/-0 ng/ml at day 0 to 90 ng/ml (P=0.05) and IL-6 levels increased from 0 to 0.16+/-0 ng/ml, respectively. The mean elevation of sIL-6R in the patients with early relapse and AGVHD was significantly higher than the mean elevation in the patients with the relatively smooth engraftment (P<0.05). Contrary to these findings, in the three patients with graft rejection, sIL-6R levels decreased while IL-6 was found to be elevated. Basic disease, conditioning regimen, type of transplant, GVHD propylaxis, and T cell depletion had no effect on sIL-6R or IL-6 levels. In summary, sIL-6R levels positively correlated with engraftment. Both sIL-6R and IL-6 levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients who developed AGVHD or early relapse following BMT. Therefore, the sIL-6R level may be used as a tool for assessing engraftment and transplant-related complications following BMT.","['Toren, A', 'Novick, D', 'Or, R', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A']","['Toren A', 'Novick D', 'Or R', 'Ackerstein A', 'Slavin S', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199607150-00029 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1996 Jul 15;62(1):138-42. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199607150-00029.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: Lytic activity of natural killer cells against autologous red cells was found in a patient with large granular lymphocytic leukemia of natural killer cells and hemolytic anemia, with no evidence of immune antibody or complement-mediated hemolysis. Large granular lymphocytes in the blood showed a CD2+ CD3- CD16+ CD57+ phenotype, cytotoxic activity against natural killer cell-sensitive K562 target cells, and no lytic activity against natural killer cell-resistant JY target cells. Cytotoxicity directed against red cells was quantified by a 51Cr-specific release assay with autologous and ABO-identical red cells used as target cells and the patients purified natural killer cells used as effector cells in the presence and absence of autologous serum. The cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells was directed against autologous red cells but not against allogenic red cells, and it was not enhanced by the presence of autologous serum in the medium. Clinical remission was induced by the administration of cyclophosphamide, after which no evidence of cytotoxic activity against the red cells could be found. CONCLUSION: Hemolytic anemia in the presence of a negative direct antiglobulin test can be attributed to a direct cytotoxic mechanism mediated by natural killer cells.","['Gilsanz, F', 'De La Serna, J', 'Molto, L', 'Alvarez-Mon, M']","['Gilsanz F', 'De La Serna J', 'Molto L', 'Alvarez-Mon M']","['Divison of Hematology, Hospital 12 de Octuber, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/*etiology', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', '*Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36596338025.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1996 May;36(5):463-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36596338025.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All antibodies bound to the human mast cell line HMC-1. The binding could be blocked by recombinant C5a and by peptide EX-1 representing amino residues 1-31 on the N-terminal domain of the C5aR. In addition, FITC-labelled C5a bound to HMC-1, and this binding could be blocked by unlabelled C5a or C5aR antibodies. C5aR-specific mRNA was detected in HMC-1 cells by RT-PCR which confirmed the expression of the C5aR gene made by these cells. Lymphocyte-conditioned medium, interferon-gamma or phorbol esters which have been shown to induce a down-regulation of C5aR on myeloid cells did not influence the expression of C5aR on HMC-1. C5a led to a transient mobilization of intracellular calcium in HMC-1 which could be inhibited by pre incubation of C5a with a C5a-specific antibody. In contrast to findings with granulocytes, HMC-1 did not respond to C5a(desArg), confirming previous findings with human skin mast cells. The findings show that (i) although HMC-1 differ from granulocytes in their responsiveness to C5a(desArg), they express similar C5aR and (ii) HMC-1 cells resemble skin mast cells in the expression and function of C5aR and may therefore serve as a model in future studies addressing the biology of this anaphylatoxin receptor on skin mast cells.","['Werfel, T', 'Oppermann, M', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Begemann, G', 'Elsner, J', 'Gotze, O', 'Zwirner, J']","['Werfel T', 'Oppermann M', 'Butterfield JH', 'Begemann G', 'Elsner J', 'Gotze O', 'Zwirner J']","['Dermatologische Klinik und Poliklinik der Medizinischen Hochschule, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Complement C5a/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Complement C5a, des-Arginine/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-272.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1996 Jul;44(1):30-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-272.x.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Complement C5a, des-Arginine)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we established the existence of a 15AB-like sequence in human and rat chromosomal DNA by Southern blot analysis. The 15AB-like sequence isolated from the rat chromosome demonstrated a 80.9% identity with 5'-CCAAGCTGTGCCTTGGGTGGC-3', at 1872-1892 of the hepatitis B virus genome, thought to be the essential region for recombination. Interestingly, this 15AB-like sequence also contained the pentanucleotide motifs GCTGG and CCAGC as an inverted repeat, part of the chi known hot spot for recombination in Escherichia coli. Importantly, a portion of the 15AB-like sequence is homologous (82.1%, 23/28 bp) to break point clusters of the human promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene, characterized by a translocation [t(15;17)], and to rearranged mouse DNA for the immunoglobulin kappa light chain. Moreover, 15AB and 15AB-like sequences have striking homologies (12/15 = 80.0% and 13/15 = 86.7%, respectively) to the consensus sequence for topoisomerase II.

The results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a WPDHGVPSEP motif (residues 417-426) in the catalytic domain of SHPTP1 and that c-Abl phosphorylates C terminal Y536 and Y564 sites. The functional significance of the c-Abl-SHPTP1 interaction is supported by the demonstration that, like c-Abl, SHPTP1 regulates the induction of Jun kinase activity following DNA damage.

It has been shown that the expression of galectin-3 is upregulated in proliferating cells, suggesting a possible role for this lectin in regulation of cell growth. Previously, we have shown that T cells infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type I express high levels of galectin-3, in contrast to uninfected cells, which do not express detectable amounts of this protein. In this study, we examined growth properties of human leukemia T cells transfected with galectin-3 cDNA, and thus constitutively overexpressing this lectin. Transfectants expressing galectin-3 displayed higher growth rates than control transfectants, which do not express this lectin. Furthermore, galectin-3 expression in these cells confers resistance to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody and staurosporine. Galectin-3 was found to have significant sequence similarity with Bcl-2, a well-characterized suppressor of apoptosis. In particular, the lectin contains the NWGR motif that is highly conserved among members of the Bcl-2 family and shown to be critical for the apoptosis-suppressing activity. We further demonstrated that galectin-3 interacts with Bc1-2 in a lactose-inhibitable manner. We conclude that galectin-3 is a regulator of cell growth and apoptosis and it may function through a cell death inhibition pathway that involves Bcl-2.","['Yang, R Y', 'Hsu, D K', 'Liu, F T']","['Yang RY', 'Hsu DK', 'Liu FT']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Galectin 3', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Transfection']",1996/06/25 00:00,1996/06/25 00:01,['1996/06/25 00:00'],"['1996/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.13.6737 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jun 25;93(13):6737-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.13.6737.,PMC39096,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",['AI20958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

K30p and K34p differ by 18 bp with changes in the long terminal repeats (LTRs) as well as in the gag, pol, and rex but not tax or env gene products. Cells transfected with clone K30p were infectious in vitro and injection of the K30p transfectants or naked K30p DNA into rabbits leads to chronic infection. In contrast, K34p did not mediate infection in vitro or in vivo, although the cell line from which it was derived is fully infectious and K34p transfectants produce intact virus particles. To localize differences involved in the ability of the clones to cause infection, six chimeric HTLV-I clones were constructed by shuffling corresponding fragments containing the substitutions in the LTRs, the gag/pol region and the rex region between K30p and K34p. Cells transfected with any of the six chimeras produced virus, but higher levels of virus were produced by cells transfected with those constructs containing the K30p rex region. Virus production was transient except in cells transfected with K30p or with a chimera consisting of the entire protein coding region of K30p flanked by K34p LTRs; only the transfectants showing persistent virus production mediated in vitro infection. In vivo infection in rabbits following intramuscular DNA injection was mediated by K30p as well as by a chimera of K30p containing the K34p rex gene. Comparisons revealed that virus production was greater and appeared earlier in rabbits injected with K30p. These data suggest that several defects in the K34p clone preclude infectivity and furthermore, provide systems to explore functions of HTLV-I genes.","['Zhao, T M', 'Robinson, M A', 'Bowers, F S', 'Kindt, T J']","['Zhao TM', 'Robinson MA', 'Bowers FS', 'Kindt TJ']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/*administration & dosage', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pX', 'Genes, pol', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rabbits', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Virulence/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1996/06/25 00:00,1996/06/25 00:01,['1996/06/25 00:00'],"['1996/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.13.6653 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jun 25;93(13):6653-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.13.6653.,PMC39081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Together with three other previously described Moloney integration clusters all responsible for enhanced gfi-1 expression the number of tumours from infected double transgenic Emu L-myc/Emu pim-1 transgenic mice with retrovirally activated gfi-1 added up to 53% underscoring the role of GFI-1 as an effective collaborator for MYC and PIM-1 in the process of lymphomagenesis.","['Schmidt, T', 'Zornig, M', 'Beneke, R', 'Moroy, T']","['Schmidt T', 'Zornig M', 'Beneke R', 'Moroy T']","['Institut fur Zellbiologie (Tumorforschung), IFZ, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genes, myc', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Transfer/genetics', 'Selection, Genetic', '*Transcription Factors', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['6w0049 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/24.13.2528 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Jul 1;24(13):2528-34. doi: 10.1093/nar/24.13.2528.,PMC145976,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gfi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of tRA and 13-cis-retinoic acid (cRA) on SC-M1 cells was compared both in vitro and in vivo in this study. Measurement of total cellular DNA was used to determine cell growth in vitro. The effect of retinoic acid on tumor growth was evaluated by implanting sustained release tRA or cRA pellets into athymic nude mice. The results showed that tRA was more potent than cRA in suppressing the growth of SC-M1 gastric cancer cells in vitro. Both tRA and cRA were effective in suppressing the growth of SC-M1 tumors in athymic nude mice. No change in the differentiation status and cell cycle phase distribution in excised tumors was observed.

Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction it was, however, demonstrated that the Jurkat cell and the PC12 cell express both A2A and A2B receptor mRNA, albeit in different relative proportions. In PC12 cells the concentration required for half-maximal response (EC50) for the full agonist 5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine (NECA) was 30 times lower than in Jurkat cells. There was no significant difference in the pA2 for the antagonist 5-amino-9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)- 1,2,4-triazolo(1,5-C)quinazolinemonomethanesulphonate (CGS 15943) between the two cell types. In the presence of forskolin (1 microM in PC12 cells; 10 microM in Jurkat cells) the EC50 value for NECA was reduced two-to sixfold. Forskolin also increased the maximal cAMP accumulation twofold in PC12 cells and sevenfold in Jurkat cells.

In the PC12 cells the addition of forskolin (1 microM) reduced the EC50 by a factor of 2(CV 1808) to 12 (SHA 125). In Jurkat cells all the analogues gave a significant, but submaximal, cAMP response in the presence of forskolin (10 microM), but they were essentially inactive in its absence. The results show that a series of 2-substituted adenosine analogues can be used to discriminate between A2A and A2B receptors. The two receptor subtypes appear to coexist, even in clonal cells selected for typical pharmacology. A2 receptor pharmacology can therefore be complex.","['van der Ploeg, I', 'Ahlberg, S', 'Parkinson, F E', 'Olsson, R A', 'Fredholm, B B']","['van der Ploeg I', 'Ahlberg S', 'Parkinson FE', 'Olsson RA', 'Fredholm BB']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)"", 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'PC12 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenethylamines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists', 'Quinazolines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/classification/genetics/metabolism', 'Triazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00168626 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 1996 Feb;353(3):250-60. doi: 10.1007/BF00168626.,,"['0 (Phenethylamines)', '0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Triazoles)', ""120225-54-9 (2-(4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine)"", '131865-79-7 (2-(2-phenylethoxy)adenosine)', '131865-94-6 (2-(2-(4-methylphenyl)ethoxy)adenosine)', '131933-18-1 (2-(2-cyclohexylethoxy)adenosine)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '37151-17-0 (2-(p-methoxyphenyl)adenosine)', '50257-95-9 (2-hexyloxyadenosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K40I59G1EF (2-phenylaminoadenosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'Y5A5D5E2AQ (9-chloro-2-(2-furyl)-(1,2,4)triazolo(1,5-c)quinazolin-5-imine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results, we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring its anchorage to the proteasome.","['Rousset, R', 'Desbois, C', 'Bantignies, F', 'Jalinot, P']","['Rousset R', 'Desbois C', 'Bantignies F', 'Jalinot P']","['CNRS UMR49, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Point Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Transfection']",1996/05/23 00:00,1996/05/23 00:01,['1996/05/23 00:00'],"['1996/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/381328a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1996 May 23;381(6580):328-31. doi: 10.1038/381328a0.,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 148 de novo AML patients of maximum 50 years (median 36 years, range 16 to 50) were enrolled in the trial. Following induction and early consolidation chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin, cytosine-arabinoside and VP-16 (DAV), patients with an HLA-identical sibling underwent allogeneic BMT. The other patients received (by randomization or patient's decision) either HDAC or high-dose busulfan plus cyclophosphamide followed by autologous BMT. RESULTS: Hundred and five 105 (70.9%) patients achieved a complete remission. The event-free survival rates after intensive postremission therapy after 72 months were: after BMT (24 patients) 62% (95% confidence interval +/- 19%), after HDAC (44 patients) 36 +/- 16% and after autologous BMT (12 patients) 18 +/- 22%. Thus allogeneic BMT was superior to autologous BMT (p = 0.04), as was HDAC compared to autologous BMT, although not significantly so (p = 0.15). Patients receiving 2 cycles of HDAC had a better 6-year event-free survival rate (47%) and a lower relapse rate (50%) than patients who received only 1 course (29% and 70% respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose busulfan/cyclophosphamide followed by unpurged autologous BMT early after achieving CR had no advantage over high-dose ara-c/daunorubicin. Two cycles of HDAC yielded better results than 1 cycle. The highest event-free survival rate was reached with myeloablative therapy followed by allogeneic BMT.","['Hubner, G', 'Link, H', 'Schonrock-Nabulsi, P', 'Wandt, H', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Loffler, B', 'Fackler-Schwalbe, I', 'Queisser, W', 'Brack, N', 'Geer, T', 'Raab, M', 'Ohl, S', 'Schneider, B', 'Schneider, C', 'Freund, M', 'Poliwoda, H', 'Ehninger, G']","['Hubner G', 'Link H', 'Schonrock-Nabulsi P', 'Wandt H', 'Gramatzki M', 'Loffler B', 'Fackler-Schwalbe I', 'Queisser W', 'Brack N', 'Geer T', 'Raab M', 'Ohl S', 'Schneider B', 'Schneider C', 'Freund M', 'Poliwoda H', 'Ehninger G']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/12 00:00,2000/03/22 09:00,['1996/04/12 00:00'],"['1996/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '1996/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 1996 Apr 12;91 Suppl 3:26-32.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,Intensive Postremissionstherapie bei akuter myeloischer Leukamie.

A decade of experiences].,18-25,PATIENTS AND RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia have been treated in six studies during 10 years at Hannover Medical School University Center. The prognosis of 111 patients without pretreatment has been improved compared to conventional therapy with a median survival of 5.7 years. Cytogenetic remissions have been induced in all studies followed for a longer time. The most pronounced improvement of prognosis has been observed in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Several conclusions can be drawn on the basis of the results on the different treatment concepts: 1. Patients with pretreatment have an unfavourable response to interferon. 2. There is a likely effect of the dose of Interferon alpha on the frequency of cytogenetic remissions. 3. The combination of Interferon alpha and interferon gamma has been toxic and ineffective in a pilot study. 4. The combination of interferon and cytosine arabinoside has a positive impact on the frequency of cytogenetic remissions. A continuous parallel application of both drugs seems to be most effective in this respect. An ongoing trial has been initiated to compare a fixed combination of Interferon alpha and cytosine arabinoside and with hydroxyurea respectively.

The Lymphoma Study Group of Japan (1984-87) proposed four clinical subtypes: (1) smoldering type; more than 5% of abnormal T-lymphocytes with less than 4000/microliters of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and few abnormal blood chemistry profiles and ATL infiltration, (2) chronic type; absolute lymphocytosis with T-lymphocytosis of more than 4000/microliters, LDH < 2 times the normal upper limit and no hypercalcemia with possible lymph-node, liver, spleen, skin and lung involvement, (3) lymphoma type; no lymphocytosis with less than 1% of abnormal T-lymphocytes, and histologically-proven lymph-node enlargement, and (4) acute type; the patients not classified into any of the above 3 types. The median survival time (MST) was 6.2 months for acute type, 10.2 months for lymphoma type, and 24.3 months for chronic type; 62.8% of smoldering type was still alive up to 4 years. ATL has a poor prognosis because of life-threatening complications including infections and hypercalcemia.

It is important to make an early diagnosis since an anti-CMV agent, ganciclovir is now available for clinical use. It takes 10-14 days to culture CMV in vitro, but now rapid diagnosis can be made by direct immunoperoxidase staining with human monoclonal antibodies against an immediate-early antigen. Another major complication is hypercalcemia. The patients' serum and tumor tissues are found to have parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) associated with hypercalcemia. Serum PTHrP (1-34) is determined by radioimmunoassay and its values seem to be correlated with hypercalcemia and the disease activity. There are still many problems to solve for ATL, but recent advances have been made in clinical subtypes and the above 2 complications.","['Tamura, K']",['Tamura K'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

TAM is a leukemoid reaction occurring frequently in Down syndrome (DS) newborn infants and they often develop true leukemia several years later. The previous findings of ""disomic homozygosity in trisomic cells"" and tentative mapping of the TAM gene to 21q11.1, and an encounter of a unique DS-associated TAM patient with inv(21) (q11.1q22.13) let us start positional cloning of the TAM gene. One type of MEX is an autosomal dominant disorder and patients with MEX sometimes develop chondrosarcoma. The MEX gene has been mapped to 8q24. We encountered a sporadic case of MEX with de novo t(8q; 13q). Thus, we hypothesized that in both patients, the TAM and the MEX genes are disrupted by the structural chromosome abnormalities. For TAM, we first mapped the proximal breakpoint of inv(21) between 2 STSs using 7 cosmid clones as FISH probes that were isolated on the basis of STS markers at the 21q11.1 region, isolated their corresponding YACs, and then analyzed them. However, since YACs corresponding to 2 other STSs between the two markers could not be isolated, we carried out a chromosome walking to construct a cosmid contig between the 2 STSs. Southern analysis with a cosmid clone within the contig detected EcoRI-/HindIII extra bands on the patient's DNA. The cDNA screening and exon trapping to isolate a gene from the region are underway. Similarly, in the MEX patient we mapped the 8q breakpoint between 2 cosmid markers, then isolated YACs and cosmid subclones. By exon trapping after detection of a cosmid covering the breakpoint, an exon-like sequence was isolated. The 3'-RACE/5'-RACE revealed a novel transcript from this cosmid. Whether the transcript is the MEX gene remains to be determined.","['Niikawa, N']",['Niikawa N'],"['Department of Human Genetics, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

However, the karyotypic analysis revealed trisomy 13 instead of Philadelphia chromosome, and the BCR gene rearrangement was not detected. In cases with acute leukemia accompanied by trisomy 13, malignant transformation of an immature hematopoietic precursor cell has been suggested by the expression of antigens characteristic of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineage. In a few cases with myelodysplastic syndrome, a multipotent stem cell disorder, trisomy 13 has also been reported.

While N1,N14-diethylhomospermine (DEHSPM) (5 mg/kg) completely prevents diarrhea in rodents, tissue distribution studies demonstrated that the principal metabolite of DEHSPM, homospermine (HSPM), accumulates and persists in tissues for a protracted period of time. This accumulation accounts for a large part of the chronic toxicity of DEHSPM. Thus a major objective was to develop a metabolically labile analogue of DEHSPM which retained the desirable biological properties of the parent drug. Hydroxyl groups, sites vulnerable to further metabolic transformation, were introduced into the external aminobutyl segments providing N1,N14-diethyl-(3R),(12R)-dihydroxyhomospermine [(HO)2-DEHSPM]. The design concept was assisted by molecular modeling, which predicted that (HO)2DEHSPM would have a Ki for polyamine transport essentially identical with that of DEHSPM.

Most significantly, however, there was no accumulation of the dideethylated metabolite in tissues from mice treated chronically with (HO)2DEHSPM, and (HO)2DEHSPM was 3-fold less toxic than DEHSPM.

Absorbed dose estimates obtained using such measurements may be subject to large variability due to the potential for regional differences in marrow activity concentration. This variability was examined in ten patients with leukemia after administration of 131I-labeled HuM195 antibody. METHODS: Regions of interest were drawn around the head and neck of the humerus and femur (both sides) and around lumbar vertebra 3 (L3) and 4 (L4) on a series of planar images collected at multiple times postadministration of the antibody. A single exponential fit to each attenuation-corrected, time-activity curve was obtained to estimate clearance half-life and the back-extrapolated percent injected activity. RESULTS: The activity concentration in the femoral head and neck (mean and s.d. = 0.04 +/- 0.02 %ID/g) was not significantly different than that measured in L3 and L4 (0.06 +/- 0.02% ID/g) but was not significantly lower than the concentrations measured in the humeral head and neck regions (0.07 +/- 0.03 %ID/g, p < 0.05). Although half-life estimates differing by more than a factor of 2 were observed in half-life between regions overall. S-factors were used for individual marrow regions to determine the mean absorbed dose to marrow in the femoral and humeral heads and the lumbar vertebrae (L3 and L4) which were 0.66 +/- 0.3, 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 2.2 +/- 0.5 mGy/MBq (2.4, 3.8 and 8.3 rad/mCi), respectively. CONCLUSION: A single value is generally quoted for the absorbed dose delivered to the red marrow following marrow-localizing radiolabeled antibody administration. These results suggest that the regional marrow dose may differ significantly from the mean.","['Sgouros, G', 'Jureidini, I M', 'Scott, A M', 'Graham, M C', 'Larson, S M', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Sgouros G', 'Jureidini IM', 'Scott AM', 'Graham MC', 'Larson SM', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radiometry', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1996 Apr;37(4):695-8.,,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],"['R01 CA62444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA58260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the role of Syk in the Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, we identified a variant of RBL-2H3 cells that has no detectable Syk by immunoblotting and by in vitro kinase reactions. In these Syk-deficient TB1A2 cells, aggregation of Fc epsilon RI induced no histamine release and no detectable increase in total cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation. However, stimulation of these cells with the calcium ionophore did induce degranulation. Fc epsilon RI aggregation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta and gamma subunits of the receptor, but no increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 and phospholipase C-gamma 2 and no detectable increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. By transfection, cloned lines were established with stable expression of Syk. In these reconstituted cells, Fc epsilon RI aggregation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 and phospholipase C-gamma 2, an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and histamine release. These results demonstrate that Syk plays a critical role in the early Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling events. It further demonstrates that Syk activation occurs downstream of receptor phosphorylation, but upstream of most of the Fc epsilon RI-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylations.","['Zhang, J', 'Berenstein, E H', 'Evans, R L', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Zhang J', 'Berenstein EH', 'Evans RL', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*physiology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Enzyme Precursors/*physiology', 'Histamine Release', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.184.1.71 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Jul 1;184(1):71-9. doi: 10.1084/jem.184.1.71.,PMC2192664,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For all solid cancers analysed together there is a significant positive dose-response (at the one-sided 2.5% significance level) if all survivors who received < 0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of < 0.2 Sv are considered. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose-response being assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the solid cancer data, a threshold of more than about 0.2 Sv is inconsistent with the data, whereas these data are consistent with there being no threshold. Linear-quadratic models and linear-quadratic models with an exponential cell-sterilization term provide no better fit than the linear model. For the three main radiation-inducible leukaemia subtypes analysed together (acute lymphatic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia) there is a significant positive dose-response (at the one-sided 2.5% significance level) if all survivors who received < 0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of < 0.2 Sv are considered. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose-response being assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, a thresh-old of more than about 0.3 Sv is inconsistent with the data. In contrast with the solid cancer data, the best estimate for the threshold level in the leukaemia data is significantly different from zero, even when allowance is made for a possible quadratic term in the dose-response, albeit at borderline levels of statistical significance (p = 0.04). There is little evidence for curvature in the leukaemia dose-response from 0.2 Sv upwards. However, the possible underestimation of the errors in the estimates of the dose threshold as a result of confounding and uncertainties not taken into account in the analysis, together with the lack of biological plausibility of a threshold, makes the interpretation of this finding questionable.","['Little, M P', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Little MP', 'Muirhead CR']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Warfare']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530096145364 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1996 Jul;70(1):83-94. doi: 10.1080/095530096145364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All six polypeptide chains are indispensable for TCR membrane expression and signaling function. In the present paper is described the analysis of a new TCR membrane-negative Jurkat T cell variant: E6.R3. The defect in this variant bears on the interaction between TCR and CD3 chains. E6.R3 cells have deleted three nucleotides in the TCR-alpha transmembrane (TM) region, which consequently lacks a leucine. This defect causes 1) lack of association between TCR alpha-chains and CD delta epsilon heterodimers; 2) lack of formation of disulphide-linked, fully glycosylated TCR-alpha beta heterodimers; and 3) lack of interaction between TCR-alpha beta/CD3 complexes and zeta-chains. Despite these defective interactions, TCR alpha-chains appear to become fully glycosylated, i.e., they are not retained in the endoplasmic reticulum but are further processed in the Golgi apparatus without such interactions. The defect may be due to the observation that in the E6.R3 TCR alpha- chains TM region, the two charged amino acids are situated on the same side of the alpha-helix; these two amino acids are exposed on opposite faces of the TM alpha-helix in normal TCR alpha-chains, possibly allowing TCR alpha-chains to interact with both CD3 delta- and CD3 epsilon-chains. Further possible consequences of the leucine deletion in the E6.R3 TCR-alpha TM region are discussed.","['Arnaud, J', 'Chenu, C', 'Huchenq, A', 'Gouaillard, C', 'Kuhlmann, J', 'Rubin, B']","['Arnaud J', 'Chenu C', 'Huchenq A', 'Gouaillard C', 'Kuhlmann J', 'Rubin B']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, CIGH/CNRS UPR 8291, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'CD3 Complex/*chemistry/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Mar 15;156(6):2155-62.,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, it was proposed that HLA-DP determinants did not function as transplantation antigens in the same way as HLA-A, -B, or -DR. We have previously shown that HLA-DP (as well as HLA-A, -B, -DQ, or -DR)-specific T cells could be isolated from skin biopsies of patients who developed an aGVHD after semiallogeneic BMT. Nevertheless, whether a single HLA-DP mismatched allele could induce a detectable allo-specific reaction in vivo after BMT remained to be established. To directly address this issue we studied one patient who presented aGVHD after receiving purified CD34+ bone marrow (BM) cells from an unrelated donor with a single HLA-DP mismatch in the GVHD direction. To characterize the immunological events associated with GVHD, we analyzed the peripheral T cell repertoire, the T cell receptor Vbeta diversity, and the specificity of T cells invading a skin biopsy at the onset of GVHD. Our results demonstrated that a large fraction of skin-infiltrating lymphocytes, which expressed diverse T cell receptors, were reactive against this single HLA-DPB1 *0501 mismatch and consequently that a single HLA-DP mismatch between BM donor and recipient can activate a strong T cell response in vivo.","['Gaschet, J', 'Lim, A', 'Liem, L', 'Vivien, R', 'Hallet, M M', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Even, J', 'Goulmy, E', 'Bonneville, M', 'Milpied, N', 'Vie, H']","['Gaschet J', 'Lim A', 'Liem L', 'Vivien R', 'Hallet MM', 'Harousseau JL', 'Even J', 'Goulmy E', 'Bonneville M', 'Milpied N', 'Vie H']","['Insitut National de la Sante et de Recherche Medicale, Plateau Technique du CHR, Mantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Alleles', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cell Movement', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'Skin/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118753 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Jul 1;98(1):100-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI118753.,PMC507405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cis-acting elements proximal to the transcription start site of the gene can be separated into the basal promoter (-1 to 191 bp) and the distal element (-133 to -92). The basal promoter contained GGTGG and GATA motifs and the distal element contained GATA-1 and NF-E2 motifs. Deletion analysis of the distal GATA site and its neighboring sequence and DNase-I footprinting/EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) analysis indicated that induced nuclear factor binding to GATA-1 and its neighboring sequence may be required for expression during MEL cell differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment. The NF-E2 site was also shown to be essential for the promoter activity. An approximately 400 bp far upstream region (-1325 to -948bp) containing the binding motifs for GGGTGG, GATA-1 and NF-E2 showed no enhancing activity when this region was examined by transient transfection assay, but it did show enhancement of the differentiation-specific promoter activity in the stable transfection assay.

From this registry, we picked up 49,102 survivors and applied organ doses based on the dosimetry system 1986 (DS86), which is named the Atomic Bomb Survivor 1993 Dose (ABS93D). The applied dose data are based on the tables listed in the DS86 final report such as the free-in-air kermas, the house shielding factors, and organ dose factors for the active bone marrow and the breast. Calculations for the 13 other organs provided in DS86 are possible. To obtain the organ doses for each survivor, it is necessary to obtain information concerning (1) place exposed, (2) whether they were shielded or not, and (3) age. ABS93D body transmission factors for active bone marrow for neutrons and gamma rays agreed with DS86 to within a few percent. Of the survivors studied, 35,123 of them were used for the relative risk estimation of leukemia mortality, adopting the same method as the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) for comparison. For the observation period from 1968 to 1989, the analyzed relative risks for leukemia mortality at 1 Gy by shielded kerma and by active bone marrow dose are 2.01 and 2.37, respectively, which are consistent with the RERF results.","['Hoshi, M', 'Matsuura, M', 'Hayakawa, N', 'Ito, C', 'Kamada, N']","['Hoshi M', 'Matsuura M', 'Hayakawa N', 'Ito C', 'Kamada N']","['Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Registries', 'Risk']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-199605000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1996 May;70(5):735-40. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199605000-00017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the population of Piedmont is not served by a conventional cancer registry covering all ages, SPMs were identified through a number of ad hoc surveys within a variety of sources. Eighteen SPM (all histologically diagnosed) were observed after a thorough survey conducted in the ontological departments in Piedmont and after a postal questionnaire addressed to general practitioners. Death certificates were also examined. The crude incidence rate was 116.5 per 100,000 person-years. Risk was higher among children whose first malignancy was diagnosed more recently (SIR = 9.8 for diagnoses in 1983-1989 vs. 4.5 for diagnoses in 1967-1974). The same tendency was confirmed in analyses restricted to children in whom leukemia was diagnosed as the first cancer. Clinical data regarding the treatment of the first malignancy were available for 16 children out of 18: 15 had received chemotherapy and 12 radiotherapy (9 SPM originated in the irradiation field). The interest of measuring the risk of SPM on a population basis (and not only in clinical series) and the advantage of close cooperation between epidemiologists and clinical oncologists are underlined.","['Magnani, C', 'Terracini, B', 'Cordero Di Montezemolo, L', 'Gallone, G', 'Luzzatto, L', 'Mosso, M L', 'Pastore, G', 'Rosso, P']","['Magnani C', 'Terracini B', 'Cordero Di Montezemolo L', 'Gallone G', 'Luzzatto L', 'Mosso ML', 'Pastore G', 'Rosso P']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Main Hospital and University, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology']",1996/07/03 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/03 00:00'],"['1996/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960703)67:1<6::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960703)67:1<6::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jul 3;67(1):6-10. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960703)67:1<6::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The C3 transferase also inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release induced by stimulating high affinity IgE and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. 4. The substrate for the C3 transferase was present in cytosol of RBL-2H3 cells, indicating the presence of rho p21. About 60% of the total cellular substrate protein remained within the cells permeabilized by 1 U/ml of streptolysin-O. 5.
