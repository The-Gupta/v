Here, as a further structural development study, we planned to introduce an additional galloyl group into alkyl gallates and gallamides. According to this strategy, various bisgallate and bisgallamide derivatives were synthesized and tested for antiproliferative activity towards HL-60 cells. In gallamide derivatives having a short alkyl chain, the additional galloyl group enhanced the antiproliferative activity.

Our previous work found that a novel proteasome inhibitor, NPI-0052, and HDACi synergistically induce apoptosis in leukemia cells in a caspase-8- and oxidant-dependent manner. Here we extend those observations to primary leukemia cells and identify novel mechanisms of synergy. Because the proximal targets of NPI-0052 and HDACi are inhibition of proteasome activity and histone acetylation, we initially examined those biochemical events. Increased acetylation of histone-H3 was detected in Jurkat and CLL primary cells treated with NPI-0052, alone or in combination with various HDACi (MS/SNDX-275 or vorinostat). Hyperacetylation by NPI-0052 occurred to a lesser extent in caspase-8-deficient cells and in cells treated with an antioxidant. These results indicate that NPI-0052 is eliciting caspase-8 and oxidative stress-dependent epigenetic alterations. In addition, real-time PCR revealed that MS/SNDX-275 repressed expression of the proteasomal beta5, beta2, and beta1 subunits, consequently inhibiting respective enzymatic activities. Overall, our results suggest that crosstalk by NPI-0052 and HDACi are contributing, along with caspase-8 activation and oxidative stress, to their synergistic cytotoxic effects in leukemia cells, reinforcing the potential clinical utility of combining these 2 agents.","['Miller, Claudia P', 'Rudra, Sharmistha', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Palladino, Michael', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Miller CP', 'Rudra S', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Palladino M', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '703P9YDP7F (marizomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vorinostat']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39239-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-174797 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 30;113(18):4289-99. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174797.

We show that in vitro priming of donor lymphocytes can circumvent the need of recipient-derived APCs in vivo for mediating robust GVL effects and significantly diminishes the risk of severe GVHD. In vitro, generated and expanded T cells (ETCs) mediate anti-leukemia effects only when primed on recipient-derived APCs. Loading of APCs in vitro with leukemia cell lysate, chimerism status of the recipient, and timing of adoptive transfer after HCT are important factors determining the outcome. Delayed transfer of ETCs resulted in strong GVL effects in leukemia-bearing full chimera (FC) and mixed chimera (MC) recipients, which were comparable with the GVL/GVHD rates observed after the transfer of naive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Upon early transfer, GVL effects were more pronounced with ETCs but at the expense of significant GVHD. The degree of GVHD was most severe in MCs after transfer of ETCs that had been in vitro primed either on nonpulsed recipient-derived APCs or with donor-derived APCs.","['Ghosh, Arnab', 'Koestner, Wolfgang', 'Hapke, Martin', 'Schlaphoff, Verena', 'Langer, Florian', 'Baumann, Rolf', 'Koenecke, Christian', 'Cornberg, Markus', 'Welte, Karl', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Sauer, Martin G']","['Ghosh A', 'Koestner W', 'Hapke M', 'Schlaphoff V', 'Langer F', 'Baumann R', 'Koenecke C', 'Cornberg M', 'Welte K', 'Blazar BR', 'Sauer MG']","['Transplantation Research Center, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Leukemia/*immunology', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39254-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-181677 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 30;113(18):4440-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-181677.

This article discusses monitoring and treatment of patients with CML after failure of or suboptimal response to imatinib therapy. We reviewed articles listed on PubMed from January 1, 2002, to July 31, 2008, and abstracts from the 2007 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Search terms used were chronic myeloid/myelogenous leukemia, imatinib, and BCR-ABL. To enable early recognition of suboptimal responses, patients should be frequently monitored according to published guidelines, including cytogenetic analysis every 6 months until a complete response is achieved and molecular monitoring every 3 months from the start of therapy or monthly if an increasing BCR-ABL1 transcript level is detected. Mutational analysis of BCR-ABL1 may assist with treatment selection. A recent survey suggests that a notable proportion of physicians do not follow treatment guidelines and that broader communication is required. Recent recommendations state that, in patients whose response to imatinib at 400 mg/d is suboptimal, the dose should be increased, whereas alternative therapies, such as dasatinib, nilotinib, and allogeneic stem cell transplant (in eligible patients), and imatinib dose escalation should be considered after imatinib failure. However, clinical data are lacking to confirm this sequence of treatments, and introducing alternative therapies at an earlier stage of treatment, for example, after a suboptimal response, may produce better long-term outcomes in a higher proportion of patients. Patient and disease characteristics should be carefully considered to optimize treatment strategy for CML.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

Degradation of procaspases, production of tBid, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release were observed in PLA(2)-treated cells. PLA(2) treatment increased Fas and FasL protein expression, and upregulated transcription of Fas and FasL mRNA. Upon exposure to PLA(2), ROS generation, p38 MAPK activation, and ERK inactivation were found in U937 cells. Abolition of PLA(2)-induced ROS generation abrogated p38 MAPK activation and upregulation of Fas and FasL expression, but restored ERK activation and viability of PLA(2)-treated cells. Block of p38 MAPK by SB202190 abolished PLA(2)-induced Fas/FasL upregulation and ERK inactivation, but not ROS generation. Activated ERK suppressed p38 MAPK activation and Fas/FasL protein expression. Selective inactivation or overexpression of p38alpha MAPK proved that upregulation of Fas/FasL and ERK inactivation were related to p38alpha MAPK activation. Deprivation of catalytic activity with PLA(2) blocked completely PLA(2)-induced Fas/FasL upregulation. Downregulation of FADD abolished PLA(2)-induced procaspase-8 degradation and rescued viability of PLA(2)-treated cells. Taken together, our results indicate that Fas/FasL upregulation in PLA(2)-treated U937 cells is elicited by ROS-mediated p38alpha MAPK activation and ERK inactivation, and suggest that autocrine Fas/FasL apoptotic mechanism is involved in PLA(2)-induced cell death.

The presence of this marker at diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of meningeal relapse. A case is described of B-ALL which was CD56 negative at diagnosis, and expressed this marker when isolated meningeal relapse was diagnosed. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old female patient presented with neurological symptoms during maintenance therapy for B-ALL. Peripheral blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were subjected to both morphological and flow cytometric analyses. The latter was carried out by a wide routine panel of MoAbs which was the same as the one at diagnosis and included CD56. Isolated meningeal relapse was diagnosed since blast cell infiltration was detected in the CSF, but not in the peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Blast cells showed an immunological phenotype similar to that at diagnosis (cyCD79a+, CD79b+, CD19+, CD22+, CD34+, CD10+, CD20+), but characterized by the acquisition of CD56 on the surfaces of more than 90% of cells. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that CD56 can be expressed at relapse of B-ALL and that its presence likely enables leukemic cell binding to the central nervous system (CNS). This phenomenon may be responsible for the isolated CNS relapse diagnosed in this patient.","['Cannizzo, Elisa', 'Carulli, Giovanni', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Zucca, Alessandra', 'Azzara, Antonio', 'Orciuolo, Enrico', 'Petrini, Mario']","['Cannizzo E', 'Carulli G', 'Buda G', 'Zucca A', 'Azzara A', 'Orciuolo E', 'Petrini M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Oncology, Transplants and New Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. elisacannizzo@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Recurrence']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]']",['869540 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2009 Feb;15(2):CS27-29.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B conducted a phase II study of carboplatin (area under the curve 6) day 1 and etoposide 80 mg/m(2) days 1-3 administered intravenously every 21 days with exisulind 250 mg orally twice daily in 44 evaluable patients with previously untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The hypothesis was the addition of a novel cytostatic agent to standard therapy may increase survival time. The primary end point of the study was to evaluate overall survival. The secondary end points were to characterize response rates and toxicity. RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male (64%), Caucasian (95%), and had performance status 0 or 1 (77%). The median age was 61 (range 44-82) years. The percentage of patients alive at 1 year was 36.4% (95% [confidence interval] CI: 24.6-53.8%). The median overall survival was 10.6 months (95% CI: 9.1-14.7). The best overall response rate was 77% (95% CI: 62-89%) with 16% of the patients achieving complete response. The most frequent grade 3 or grade 4 hematological toxicities were neutropenia (64%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and febrile neutropenia (16%).

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B designed a phase II trial to test a standardized method of this technique in a multi-institutional setting. If validated, the technique could provide a more accurate and sensitive way to identify lymph node metastases. METHODS: Patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer amenable to resection were candidates for this trial. Intraoperatively, tumors were injected with technetium sulfur colloid (0.25 mCi). The tumor and lymph nodes were measured in vivo with a hand held Geiger counter and resection of the tumor and nodes was carried out. Sentinel nodes, all other nodes and the tumor were analyzed with standard histologic assessment. Negative sentinel nodes were also evaluated with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In this phase II trial, 8 surgeons participated (1-13 patients enrolled per surgeon), and 46 patients (out of a planned 150) were enrolled. Of these, 43 patients had cancer and an attempted complete resection, and 39 patients underwent sentinel node mapping. One or more sentinel nodes were identified in 24 of the 39 patients (61.5%). The sentinel node(s) were found to be accurate (no other nodes were positive for cancer if the sentinel node was negative) in 20/24 patients (83.3%). In the overall group the sentinel node mapping procedure was found to be accurate in 20/39 patients (51.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative sentinel node mapping in lung cancer with radioisotope yielded lower accrual and worse accuracy than expected. The multi-institutional attempt at validating this technique was unsuccessful.","['Liptay, Michael J', ""D'amico, Thomas A"", 'Nwogu, Chumy', 'Demmy, Todd L', 'Wang, Xiaofei F', 'Gu, Lin', 'Litle, Virginia R', 'Swanson, Scott J', 'Kohman, Leslie J']","['Liptay MJ', ""D'amico TA"", 'Nwogu C', 'Demmy TL', 'Wang XF', 'Gu L', 'Litle VR', 'Swanson SJ', 'Kohman LJ']","['The Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Chicago, IL, USA. michael_liptay@rush.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '556Q0P6PB1 (Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/secondary/surgery', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Large Cell/secondary/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*secondary/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/secondary/surgery', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymph Nodes/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monitoring, Intraoperative', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Risk Factors', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Survival Rate', '*Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/05/22 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e318194a2c3 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)30959-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2009 Feb;4(2):198-202. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e318194a2c3.,10.1097/JTO.0b013e318194a2c3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,['Thoracic Surgery Subcommittee of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,,,,

The Runt domain of AML1 in both proteins mediates DNA binding and heterodimerization with the core binding factor beta (CBFbeta) subunit. To determine whether CBFbeta is required for AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 activity, we introduced amino acid substitutions into the Runt domain that disrupt heterodimerization with CBFbeta but not DNA binding. We show that CBFbeta contributes to AML1-ETO's inhibition of granulocyte differentiation, is essential for its ability to enhance the clonogenic potential of primary mouse bone marrow cells, and is indispensable for its cooperativity with the activated receptor tyrosine kinase TEL-PDGFbetaR in generating acute myeloid leukemia in mice. Similarly, CBFbeta is essential for TEL-AML1's ability to promote self-renewal of B cell precursors in vitro.

To model JMML pathogenesis, we generated knockin mice that conditionally express the leukemia-associated mutant Ptpn11(D61Y). Expression of Ptpn11(D61Y) in all hematopoietic cells evokes a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), featuring leukocytosis, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and factor-independent colony formation by bone marrow (BM) and spleen cells. The Lin(-)Sca1(+)cKit(+) (LSK) compartment is expanded and ""right-shifted,"" accompanied by increased stem cell factor (SCF)-evoked colony formation and Erk and Akt activation. However, repopulating activity is decreased in diseased mice, and mice that do engraft with Ptpn11(D61Y) stem cells fail to develop MPD. Ptpn11(D61Y) common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) produce cytokine-independent colonies in a cell-autonomous manner and demonstrate elevated Erk and Stat5 activation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation.

Our aim was to describe the incidence of secondary brain tumors and to define the significance of treatment-related risk factors and host characteristics in a cohort of childhood leukemia survivors. Our cohort consisted of 60 consecutive cranially irradiated adult survivors of childhood leukemia treated in Oulu University Hospital (Oulu, Finland); MRI of the brain was performed on 49. The sites of the tumors, their histology, and details of the leukemia treatment were determined. Of the 49 patients, 11 (22%) 1-8 years of age at the time of diagnosis developed meningioma later in life, while no other brain tumors were seen. In this cohort, the development of meningioma seemed to show undisputable linkage with long latency periods (mean, 25 years; range, 14-34 years) and an increasing incidence 20 years after the treatment (47%). Three patients had multiple meningiomas, two had recurrent disease, and one had an atypical meningioma. Age at the time of irradiation, gender, or cumulative doses of chemotherapeutic agents showed no significant association with the development of meningiomas. The high incidence of meningiomas in this study was associated with long follow-up periods. Although the cohort is small, it seems probable that the increasing incidence of meningioma will shadow the future of cranially irradiated leukemia survivors.

Recently, vasohibin-1 (VASH1), an endothelium-derived negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis, has been isolated and characterized. VASH1 is induced by VEGF or bFGF in endothelial cells (ECs) and inhibits their proliferation and migration. However, there are no data on the induction and expression of VASH1 in haematopoietic cells (HCs). Here, we show that the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population, but not haematopoietic progenitors (HPs) or mature HCs from adult bone marrow (BM) constitutively express VASH1. However, HPs, but not HSCs, can be induced to express VASH1 after BM suppression by 5-FU. Knock-down of the VASH1 gene in VASH1(+) leukaemia cells induced cell proliferation. These results suggest a role for VASH1 in negative feedback regulation of HP proliferation during recovery following BM ablation.","['Naito, Hisamichi', 'Kidoya, Hiroyasu', 'Sato, Yasufumi', 'Takakura, Nobuyuki']","['Naito H', 'Kidoya H', 'Sato Y', 'Takakura N']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (VASH1 protein, human)', '0 (Vash1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ischemia', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['mvp021 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvp021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2009 May;145(5):653-9. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvp021.

We have previously shown that HNE activates the transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and promotes cytoprotective heat shock gene expression and that silencing HSF1 sensitizes the colon cancer cell line RKO to HNE-induced apoptosis. Here we report a reduction in the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 in HSF1-silenced RKO cells, and we examine the underlying mechanism. To investigate the regulation of the Bcl-2 family by HSF1, microarray analysis of gene expression was performed. We observed that the Hsp70 co-chaperone, BAG3 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3), is strongly induced by HNE in control but not in HSF1-silenced colon cancer cells. Silencing BAG3 expression with small interfering RNA caused a dramatic reduction in Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 protein levels in colon cancer cells and increased apoptosis, similar to the effect of silencing HSF1. Also, immunoprecipitation experiments indicate specific interactions between BAG3, Hsp70, and the Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-X(L). Overall, our data reveal that BAG3 is HSF1-inducible and has a unique role facilitating cancer cell survival during pro-apoptotic stress by stabilizing the level of Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Jacobs, Aaron T', 'Marnett, Lawrence J']","['Jacobs AT', 'Marnett LJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, Center in Molecular Toxicology, and Vanderbilt-Ingram Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/06/02 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32315-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M808656200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Apr 3;284(14):9176-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M808656200.

The role of the CBF member RUNX2 in hematopoiesis is poorly understood. Genetic evidence suggests that deregulation of Runx2 may cause myeloid leukemia in mice expressing the fusion oncogene Cbfb-MYH11. In this study, we show that sustained expression of Runx2 modulates Cbfbeta-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC)-mediated myeloid leukemia development. Expression of Runx2 is high in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and decreases during myeloid differentiation. Sustained Runx2 expression hinders myeloid progenitor differentiation capacity and represses expression of CBF targets Csf1R, Mpo, Cebpd, the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a, and myeloid markers Cebpa and Gfi1. In addition, full-length Runx2 cooperates with Cbfbeta-SMMHC in leukemia development in transplantation assays. Furthermore, we show that the nuclear matrix-targeting signal and DNA-binding runt-homology domain of Runx2 are essential for its leukemogenic activity. Conversely, Runx2 haplo-insufficiency delays the onset and reduces the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia. Together, these results indicate that Runx2 is expressed in the stem cell compartment, interferes with differentiation and represses CBF targets in the myeloid compartment, and modulates the leukemogenic function of Cbfbeta-SMMHC in mouse leukemia.","['Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Zaidi, Sayyed K', 'Gornostaeva, Svetlana', 'Komori, Toshihisa', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Castilla, Lucio H']","['Kuo YH', 'Zaidi SK', 'Gornostaeva S', 'Komori T', 'Stein GS', 'Castilla LH']","['Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Runx2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39392-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-162248 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 2;113(14):3323-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-162248.

We have previously shown that Fzd9(-/-) mice have a deficiency in pre-B cells at a stage when self-renewing division is occurring in preference to further differentiation, before light chain immunoglobulin recombination. To determine whether pathologic usurpation of this pathway plays a role in B-cell leukemogenesis, we examined the expression of Wnt/Fzd pathway genes in the Emu-TCL1 mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We find that, in the course of leukemogenesis, the expression of Wnt16, Wnt10alpha, Fzd1, and most dramatically, Fzd6, is progressively up-regulated in the transformed CD5(+) B cells of these mice, as are beta-catenin protein levels. Elimination of Fzd6 expression by crossing into Fzd6(-/-) mice significantly delays development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in this model. Our findings suggest that the self-renewal signals mediated by Wnt/Fzd that are enlisted during B-cell development may be pathologically reactivated in the neoplastic transformation of mature B cells.","['Wu, Qing-Li', 'Zierold, Claudia', 'Ranheim, Erik A']","['Wu QL', 'Zierold C', 'Ranheim EA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (Fzd6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Frizzled Receptors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39423-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-163303 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Mar 26;113(13):3031-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-163303.

Studies in HLA-matched HSCT, however, have also demonstrated improved outcome in patients lacking class I ligands for donor inhibitory KIR (""missing ligand""), indicating that classically nonlicensed donor NK cells expressing KIR for non-self MHC class I ligands may exhibit functional competence in HSCT. We examined NK function in 16 recipients of T cell-depleted allografts from HLA-identical or KIR-ligand matched donors after myeloablative therapy. After HSCT, nonlicensed NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR for non-self class I exhibit robust intracellular IFN-gamma and cytotoxic response to target cells lacking cognate ligand, gradually becoming tolerized to self by day 100. These findings could not be correlated with cytokine environment or phenotypic markers of NK development, nor could they be attributed to non-KIR receptors such as CD94/NKG2A.

The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of ara-C in a myeloablative regimen in a cohort of canine lymphomas with bone marrow involvement. Seventeen dogs were enrolled. Eight were treated with a VCAA-based protocol (Group 1) and nine with the same regimen added with ara-C (Group 2). Ara-C was administered on a 5-day schedule as an i.v. continuous infusion at the dose of 150 mg m(-2) per day for five consecutive days. During treatment complete remission (CR) was achieved in two dogs in Group 1 and in eight dogs in Group 2. CR rate was significantly higher in Group 2 (P < 0.01). Median survival was 72.5 days (range 6-174) in Group 1 and 243 days (range 73-635) in Group 2. Survival was significantly longer in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Both protocols were well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. Ara-C added to a VCAA-based protocol appears to be safe and beneficial in dogs with stage V lymphoma.

AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of dental anxiety among children who have survived cancer. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we examined 51 6- to 14-year-old children who had been treated for cancer at Aalborg Hospital, and 192 children without cancer. All children answered the Dental Subscale of the Children's Fear Survey Schedule. Dental anxiety was defined as a dental anxiety score exceeding the mean dental anxiety score + 1 standard deviation for the children without cancer. RESULTS: Children with cancer did not have an increased prevalence of dental anxiety compared with children without cancer: the prevalence ratio was 0.41 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10-1.24]. The mean dental anxiety score was 23.1 (95% CI: 21.2-25.0) among children who had been treated for cancer, and 24.7 (95% CI: 23.4-26.0) among children without cancer (mean difference: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-4.3).

Potentially fatal myelotoxicity may develop after standard doses of MP in TPMT deficient patients. OBJECTIVES: To establish if individually tailored doses of MP can reduce myelotoxicity in ALL patients carrying mutations in the TPMT gene.To establish if variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) genotype influences the treatment effects of MP. METHOD: Fifty randomly selected patients treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocol were tested for most frequent TPMT gene mutations using PCR based methods. VNTR genotype was determined in 20 children by PCR methods. During the maintenance phase, we recorded the number of weeks when therapy was applied in either full doses, reduced doses or when patients were without any therapy. RESULTS: Fifty children were examined, 29 boys (58%) and 21 girls (42%); age ranged from 1.8-17.3 years (median 6.2 years). Four patients (8%) were heterozygous for TPMT mutations, all of them carrying the TPMT*3A variant. After 12, 14, 16 and 19 weeks of therapy with reduced doses of MP, the patients switched to full doses due to good tolerance.There was no therapy omission. Cumulative dose of MP was reduced for 7.8%, 7.4%, 11.2% and 16.6%, respectively, in patients with TPMT mutations. No significant difference was found between children with no mutations and TPMT heterozygotes regarding full dose therapy (53.6 vs. 55.7 weeks, respectively) and reduced dose therapy (19.9 vs. 15.2 weeks respectively). The number of detected VNTRs ranged from four to seven. The majority of patients had different number of VNTRs on homologous chromosomes. Most frequently detected polymorphism was VNTR*5. No correlation was found between TPMT and VNTR genotype inheritance. CONCLUSION: Obeying pharmacogenetic principles in the treatment of childhood ALL may improve the tolerance of therapy with MP.","['Dokmanovic, Lidija', 'Janic, Dragana', 'Krstovski, Nada', 'Zukic, Branka', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Pavlovic, Sonja']","['Dokmanovic L', 'Janic D', 'Krstovski N', 'Zukic B', 'Tosic N', 'Pavlovic S']",,['srp'],['Journal Article'],Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contraindications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics']",2009/01/31 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/01/31 09:00'],"['2009/01/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh0812609d [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2008 Nov-Dec;136(11-12):609-16. doi: 10.2298/sarh0812609d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry are the only methods, which allow identification of this disease, either in isolated skin lesions or in a leukemic form. Although the co-expression of CD4 and CD56 is rare and the number of described cases is low, this group bears similar characteristics in a clinical course of disease. It is a very aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, usually with primary skin involvement, in half of the cases infiltrating bone marrow or lymph nodes. Despite high rate of initial response to treatment, early and widespread relapses occur and patients die of disease progression. Although the physiological counterpart of tumour cells was identified, the origin of the disease is still discussed because of aberrant expression of cell markers. Optimal treatment is not known.

Such syncytia can be found as ""multinucleated giant cells"" in the brain from HIV-1-infected individuals, as well as in lymphoid tissues. Syncytia elicited by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) manifest the aggregation of PML in discrete nuclear bodies and the recruitment of TopBP1, NBS1 and ATM to DNA damage foci containing phosphorylated ATM and histone H2AX (""-H2AX). This DNA damage response then culminates in p53-dependent activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Here, we show that Env-elicited syncytia also manifest activating phosphorylations of the checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1 and Chk2), and both Chk1 and Chk2 colocalize with ""-H2AX foci. However, only the siRNA-mediated knockdown of Chk2, not the depletion of Chk1, inhibits mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and subsequent syncytial apoptosis. Depletion of PML, TopBP1, NBS1 or ATM inhibit the activating phosphorylation of Chk2.

The incidence of thrombotic events in cancer patients is increased compared to normal population. Data on inherited thrombophilia and cancer is limited. Most studies are small, and results are varied by geography, tumor type, stage of disease and therapy. Nevertheless, it seems that factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation may increase VTE risk in cancer patients. Data also exist for hyperhomocysteinemia. Cancer patients with thrombophilia who have a central vein catheter are a special group with increased venous thrombotic event (VTE) risk. Among acquired risk factors, antiphospholipid antibodies are common in cancer patients, especially in lymphoproliferative diseases.

Patients who become resistant to imatinib treatment often develop secondary mutations, the most common of which results in a substitution of isoleucine for threonine at the same location in the ATP-binding domain in all three kinases (in KIT this occurs at amino acid 670). We sought to determine why Thr is always replaced by Ile. METHODS: All possible point mutations in the DNA triplet codon that could result in amino acid substitutions at Thr670 (Thr670Arg, Thr670Ile, Thr670Lys, Thr670Ala, Thr670Ser, Thr670Pro) were introduced by site-specific mutagenesis of the complementary DNA for a constitutively active, imatinib-sensitive form of the KIT receptor, Delta559/KIT. The resulting mutant KIT proteins were transiently expressed in COS1 African green monkey kidney cells grown with and without imatinib, and cell extracts were analyzed for KIT activation by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting to determine autophosphorylation levels. We also performed molecular modeling to estimate the relative affinities of wild-type (Thr670) KIT and the KIT mutants for ATP and imatinib. RESULTS: Like the parental strain, Thr670Ala, Thr670Ser, and Thr670Lys mutants were inhibited by 5 microM imatinib, but in comparison, they were only weakly active and Thr670Pro and Thr670Arg were not active at all. Only the Thr670Ile mutant was fully active (autophosphorylated) and resistant to imatinib. These findings were consistent with computer modeling predictions that ranked these mutants Thr - Ile > Ala, Ser > Lys >> Pro according to their affinity for ATP but Thr > Ala, Ser > Lys >Pro - Arg - Ile according to their affinity for imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: This combination of in vitro and molecular modeling analyses shows why, among all possible amino acid substitutions at position 670 of KIT, only Ile is naturally selected as a resistance mutant in imatinib-treated GIST patients.","['Negri, Tiziana', 'Pavan, Giovanni Maria', 'Virdis, Emanuela', 'Greco, Angela', 'Fermeglia, Maurizio', 'Sandri, Marco', 'Pricl, Sabrina', 'Pierotti, Marco A', 'Pilotti, Silvana', 'Tamborini, Elena']","['Negri T', 'Pavan GM', 'Virdis E', 'Greco A', 'Fermeglia M', 'Sandri M', 'Pricl S', 'Pierotti MA', 'Pilotti S', 'Tamborini E']","['Experimental Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Computer Simulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Models, Molecular', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design', 'Threonine']",2009/01/30 09:00,2009/03/07 09:00,['2009/01/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [medline]']","['djn477 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djn477 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Feb 4;101(3):194-204. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djn477.

Although cure rates exceed 80%, considerable unexplained interindividual variability exists in treatment response. OBJECTIVES: To assess the contribution of inherited genetic variation to therapy response and to identify germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk of minimal residual disease (MRD) after remission induction chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Genome-wide interrogation of 476,796 germline SNPs to identify genotypes that were associated with MRD in 2 independent cohorts of children with newly diagnosed ALL: 318 patients in St Jude Total Therapy protocols XIIIB and XV and 169 patients in Children's Oncology Group trial P9906. Patients were enrolled between 1994 and 2006 and last follow-up was in 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimal residual disease at the end of induction therapy, measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: There were 102 SNPs associated with MRD in both cohorts (median odds ratio, 2.18; P < or = .0125), including 5 SNPs in the interleukin 15 (IL15) gene. Of these 102 SNPs, 21 were also associated with hematologic relapse (P < .05). Of 102 SNPs, 21 were also associated with antileukemic drug disposition, generally linking MRD eradication with greater drug exposure. In total, 63 of 102 SNPs were associated with early response, relapse, or drug disposition. CONCLUSION: Host genetic variations are associated with treatment response for childhood ALL, with polymorphisms related to leukemia cell biology and host drug disposition associated with lower risk of residual disease.","['Yang, Jun J', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Trevino, Lisa R', 'French, Deborah', 'Campana, Dario', 'Downing, James R', 'Evans, William E', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Bowman, W P', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Yang JJ', 'Cheng C', 'Yang W', 'Pei D', 'Cao X', 'Fan Y', 'Pounds SB', 'Neale G', 'Trevino LR', 'French D', 'Campana D', 'Downing JR', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH', 'Devidas M', 'Bowman WP', 'Camitta BM', 'Willman CL', 'Davies SM', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Relling MV']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linear Models', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2009/01/30 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2009/01/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]']","['301/4/393 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2009.7 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2009 Jan 28;301(4):393-403. doi: 10.1001/jama.2009.7.,10.1001/jama.2009.7 [doi],,"['R01 CA060419-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078224-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-259006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 086011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 093552-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA029139-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093552-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA R3736401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086011-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061374-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2664534,,,,,['NIHMS89586'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA-induced phosphorylation of the Akt kinase and ribosomal S6 protein in APL cells was sensitive to class I PI3K, and p110beta or p110delta inhibitors, and to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin. In primary APL, inhibition of p110beta or p110delta triggered apoptosis in the absence or presence of ATRA. Class I PI3K inhibition could also reverse ATRA-induced protection of these cells against doxorubicin and arsenic trioxide, correlating with impaired induction of the antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein. The differentiation-inducing effects of ATRA were not dependent on class I PI3K/mTOR. In summary, class I PI3K signaling, mediated by p110beta and p110delta, plays an important role in basal and ATRA-induced cell survival mechanisms in APL. Addition of PI3K inhibitors to induction treatment regimens may provide therapeutic benefit.","['Billottet, Clotilde', 'Banerjee, Lalita', 'Vanhaesebroeck, Bart', 'Khwaja, Asim']","['Billottet C', 'Banerjee L', 'Vanhaesebroeck B', 'Khwaja A']","['Centre for Cell Signalling, Queen Mary University of London, Institute of Cancer, Barts and The London School of Medicine, John Vane Science Centre University College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2009/01/30 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2608 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2608 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;69(3):1027-36. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2608.

Despite consistently showing a shorter duration of neutropenia, multiple, prospective, randomized trials have documented only modest benefits in terms of reduction in the incidence and severity of infections, without substantial gains or impact in complete remission, overall survival, and disease-free survival rates. Growth factors have also been used to recruit quiescent leukemia cells into the S-phase of the cell cycle to increase their susceptibility to chemotherapy with the goal to reduce relapse and resistance. Randomized trials evaluating this priming strategy have consistently shown improvement in disease- or event-free survival in the intermediate-risk group of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, but no overall survival benefit.

Clearly, elderly patients with AML represent a highly heterogeneous group, based on a wide array of disease- and patient-specific characteristics. Therefore, novel treatment strategies aimed at overcoming specific biologic modifiers of disease resistance will be paramount to successful therapy for some, whereas in others, the ability to administer a low-toxicity regimen on a chronic basis to achieve disease control may prove beneficial, perhaps even in the absence of complete responses. In addition, identifying genomic and proteomic expression patterns using an individual's unique neoplastic clone will likely optimize the ability to predict responders to novel therapies and identify new and relevant therapeutic targets. The development of reduced-intensity preparative regimens for allogeneic transplants has allowed physicians and patients to explore the option of long-term disease control. The risk-benefit ratio for this procedure will depend on the disease state, patient performance status, and comorbidities. However, current results underscore that age alone should no longer be a contraindication for allogeneic transplant with curative intent in these patients, and long-term disease control with good quality of life is possible and can be expected. Future trials combining the novel therapies described in this article and novel transplant technologies should allow more elderly patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndromes to experience long and productive lives.","['Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Giralt, Sergio']","['Lancet JE', 'Giralt S']","['Department of Hematologic Malignancies, H.

METHODS: Forty newly diagnosed adult patients with B-lineage (B-) and T cell (T-) ALL were involved in this study. All DNA samples were obtained from the bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNC). IgH, IgK, TCRB, TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements were detected by BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR protocols, which included 96 different primers and 14 multiplex PCR tubes. RESULTS: The clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) rearrangements were found in 96% of B-ALL, 86% being IgH and 14% IgK.

METHODS: Quantification of AML1-ETO(+) mRNA was performed serially on bone marrow samples from 17 patients with AML1-ETO(+) AML after HSCT. Q-PCR used the TagMan probe system. The AML1-ETO mRNA level was normalized by control gene abl. Cytogenetic response was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: The reproducible sensitivity of Q-PCR was 5 copies. Out of 16 patients who achieved sustained complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), one each died of graft-versus-host disease and infection. The median AML1-ETO mRNA levels in the rest of 14 CCyR patients were 0 (0 - 0.740), 0.026 (0 - 2.900), 0.039 (0 - 3.300) at +1, +2, +3 month post allo-HSCT, respectively and in 5 CCyR patients beyond 1 year following allo-HSCT (median follow-up 685 days) was 0.078 (0.003 - 0.120).

METHODS: Fluorescence real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of LYL1 in leukemias. Specific siRNA was used to silence the expression of LYL1 in K562 cells. RESULTS: Compared to CD34 positive cells from normal bone marrow, the expression of LYL1 was significantly elevated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). LYL1 expression was higher in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blastic crisis than that in chronic phase (7.831 vs 1.672, P < 0.01). LYL1 expression in AML in complete remission (CR) was down-regulated as compared with that of un-remission patients (1.400 vs 9.985, P < 0.01). Down-regulation of endogenous expression of LYL1 in K562 cells by a combination of three specific siRNA could inhibit cellular growth and clonogenicity to some extent.

One hundred and forty-nine cases (34%) had no symptoms at diagnosis and 145 cases (33.1%) confirmed by routine blood tests due to other diseases. The median platelet count at diagnosis was 1000 x 10(9)/L [(533 -3740) x 10(9)/L]. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in 255 cases which showed mainly increase of enlarged mature megakaryocytes with hyper-lobulated nuclei and local proliferation of reticular fiber was revealed in 51 cases. JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 90(78.9%) of 114 patients studied. Karyotype analysis was performed in 180 cases and 6 (3.3%) had clonal chromosomal aberrations. Two hundred and sixty-one patients were followed up over 12 months with a median of 60 months (range from 12 to 300 months). Seventeen cases (6.5%) evolved into marrow fibrosis (MF) and one case into polycythemia vera (PV). One case evolved into PV 6 years and then MF 20 years after diagnosis of ET. Three cases developed acute monocyte leukemia (M5), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized predominantly by thrombocytosis and hemorrhage. The percentage of asymptomatic cases is high. The prognoses for most cases were good with a few cases may evolve into MF.","['Lan, Hai-Feng', 'Fang, Zhi-Hong', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Wang, Xiao-Yan', 'Xue, Feng', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Guo, Zhen-Xing', 'Dong, Xun-Wei', 'Li, Shang-Zhu', 'Zheng, Yi-Zhou', 'Zhang, Feng-Kui', 'Qian, Lin-Sheng', 'Ji, Lin-Xiang', 'Xiao, Zhi-Jian', 'Yang, Ren-Chi']","['Lan HF', 'Fang ZH', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang XY', 'Xue F', 'Zhang L', 'Guo ZX', 'Dong XW', 'Li SZ', 'Zheng YZ', 'Zhang FK', 'Qian LS', 'Ji LX', 'Xiao ZJ', 'Yang RC']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/30 09:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/01/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Sep;29(9):587-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter are products of intra- (e.g. FIP1L1-PDGFRA) or inter-chromosomal (e.g. ETV6-PDGFRB) gene fusions. BCR-ABL1 is associated with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and mutant PDGFR with an MPN phenotype characterized by eosinophilia and in addition, in case of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, bone marrow mastocytosis. These genotype-phenotype associations have been effectively exploited in the development of highly accurate diagnostic assays and molecular targeted therapy. It is hoped that the same will happen in other MPN with specific genetic alterations: polycythemia vera (JAK2 V617F and other JAK2 mutations), essential thrombocythemia (JAK2V617F and MPL515 mutations), primary myelofibrosis (JAK2 V617F and MPL515 mutations), systemic mastocytosis (KITD816V and other KIT mutations) and stem cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ZNF198-FGFR1 and other FGFR1 fusion genes).

These cells share similar properties with normal stem cells and are termed 'cancer stem cells'. Cancer stem cells have been identified in acute myeloid leukaemia and in some solid tumours by their distinct expression of cell surface antigens. Their long-term, self-renewing capacity is thought to be a determining factor in the maintenance and regrowth of the tumour. Studies on haematopoietic cancers show that important signalling pathways and genes for normal haematopoiesis, such as Wnt, NF-kappaB, Notch, hedgehog (Hh) and Bmi1, are oncogenic, thereby potentially involved in cancer stem cell regulation. Elimination of cancer stem cells in tumours could result in the degeneration of downstream cells, which makes them potential targets for new cancer therapies.","['Cheng, Xiaoyu', ""O'Neill, Helen C""]","['Cheng X', ""O'Neill HC""]","['School of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, College of Science, Australian National University, Canberra ACT, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Niche/pathology']",2009/01/30 09:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2009/01/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM664 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00664.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2009 Nov-Dec;13(11-12):4377-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00664.x.

Cross-sectional and short-term prospective studies have demonstrated secondary hyperparathyroidism during imatinib therapy, and variable changes in markers of bone turnover. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the biochemical and skeletal effects of imatinib during long-term therapy. DESIGN: This was a 2-yr prospective study. SETTING: The study was performed at an academic clinical research center. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Nine patients with bcr-abl positive chronic myeloid leukemia were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received Imatinib mesylate 400 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum and urine biochemistry, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density were measured. RESULTS: Participants developed mild secondary hyperparathyroidism, with significant decreases in serum calcium and phosphate (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001 vs. baseline, respectively) and an increase in PTH (P < 0.0001 vs. baseline). Biochemical markers of bone turnover demonstrated a biphasic response, with an initial increase in markers of bone formation being followed by a decrease in markers of both formation and resorption. Bone density at the lumbar spine increased [mean (95% confidence interval) change from baseline 3.6% (1.6, 5.5); P = 0.003] as did that at the total body [1.4% (0.2, 2.5); P = 0.065], whereas that at the proximal femur did not change [-0.12% (-3.0, 2.7); P = 0.93]. Body weight and fat mass increased significantly (P < 0.0001 vs. baseline). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with imatinib leads to persistent mild secondary hyperparathyroidism. Despite this, bone turnover is decreased, and bone density is stable or increased. Evaluation of the skeletal actions and safety of imatinib during longer-term therapy is warranted.","[""O'Sullivan, Susannah"", 'Horne, Anne', 'Wattie, Diana', 'Porteous, Fran', 'Callon, Karen', 'Gamble, Greg', 'Ebeling, Peter', 'Browett, Peter', 'Grey, Andrew']","[""O'Sullivan S"", 'Horne A', 'Wattie D', 'Porteous F', 'Callon K', 'Gamble G', 'Ebeling P', 'Browett P', 'Grey A']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Auckland, Private Bag, Auckland, New Zealand. s.osullivan@auckland.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '7Q7P4S7RRE (Fibroblast Growth Factor-23)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Density/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcitriol/blood', 'Calcium/blood', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor-23', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/blood', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parathyroid Hormone/blood', 'Phosphates/blood', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/blood']",2009/01/29 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/01/29 09:00'],"['2009/01/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['jc.2008-2324 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2008-2324 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Apr;94(4):1131-6. doi: 10.1210/jc.2008-2324.

Here we investigated whether HDAC7 has an impact on embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation into smooth muscle cells (SMCs). ES cells were seeded on collagen-IV-coated flasks and cultured in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor in differentiation medium to induce SMC differentiation. Western blots and double-immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that HDAC7 has a parallel expression pattern with SMC marker genes. In ex vivo culture of embryonic cells from SM22-LacZ transgenic mice, overexpression of HDAC7 significantly increased beta-galactosidase-positive cell numbers and enzyme activity, indicating its crucial role in SMC differentiation during embryonic development. We found that HDAC7 undergoes alternative splicing during ES cell differentiation. Platelet-derived growth factor enhanced ES cell differentiation into SMCs through upregulation of HDAC7 splicing. Further experiments revealed that HDAC7 splicing induced SMC differentiation through modulation of the SRF-myocardin complex. These findings suggest that HDAC7 splicing is important for SMC differentiation and vessel formation in embryonic development.","['Margariti, Andriana', 'Xiao, Qingzhong', 'Zampetaki, Anna', 'Zhang, Zhongyi', 'Li, Hongling', 'Martin, Daniel', 'Hu, Yanhua', 'Zeng, Lingfang', 'Xu, Qingbo']","['Margariti A', 'Xiao Q', 'Zampetaki A', 'Zhang Z', 'Li H', 'Martin D', 'Hu Y', 'Zeng L', 'Xu Q']","[""Cardiovascular Division, King's College London BHF Centre, London SE5 9NU, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mef2c protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (myocardin)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (serum response factor kinase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Becaplermin', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Embryonic Development', '*Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone Deacetylases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/enzymology', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/01/29 09:00,2009/04/22 09:00,['2009/01/29 09:00'],"['2009/01/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [medline]']","['jcs.034850 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.034850 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2009 Feb 15;122(Pt 4):460-70. doi: 10.1242/jcs.034850.

METHODS: The CDR3 of TCR Valpha 29 and Vbeta 24 subfamily genes were amplified in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of one case with APL using RT-PCR. The positive PCR products were further labeled with fluorescent and analyzed by genescan technique for the CDR3 size, to evaluate clonality of the detectable TCR Valpha and Vbeta T cells. The products of the oligoclonal T cells were analyzed by sequencing to define the sequence of CDR3. RESULTS: Oligoclonal T cells expressed TCR Valpha6, Valpha10 or Vbeta23 genes were identified from the APL patient. The molecular characteristics of the CDR3 of Valpha and Vbeta genes rearrangement were Valpha6NJalpha17, Valpha10NJalpha35 and Vbeta23NDbeta1NJbeta2.7. The amino acid sequence of CDR3 region in TCR Valpha 6, Valpha10 and Vbeta23 subfamilies were CAMRENSAGNK, YLCAGDELLWECA or CASSSKWAGGTYEQY, respectively. These sequences were accepted by GenBank (Accession Number EU544946, EU544947 and EU647219). CONCLUSION: Three idiotype Valpha and Vbeta sequences are identified in a case with APL, which is thought that may mediate the host specific immunity response for leukemia cells in APL. It might provide data for farther research on the specific immunotherapy of APL.","['Chen, Shao-hua', 'Li, Yang-qiu', 'Yang, Li-jian', 'Zhou, Yu-bing', 'Li, Bo', 'Zhang, Xue-li', 'Luo, Geng-xin']","['Chen SH', 'Li YQ', 'Yang LJ', 'Zhou YB', 'Li B', 'Zhang XL', 'Luo GX']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Jinan University, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. jnshaohuachen@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Valpha24 protein, human)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2009/01/29 09:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/01/29 09:00'],"['2009/01/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;25(2):136-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/EU544946', 'GENBANK/EU544947', 'GENBANK/EU647219']",,,,,,,,,,

Among the different DC subsets, plasmacytoid DC (pDC) are well known for their ability to recognize and respond to a variety of viruses by secreting high levels of type I interferon. METHODS: We analyzed here, the transduction efficiency of a pDC cell line, GEN2.2, and of pDC derived from CD34+ progenitors, using lentiviral vectors (LV) pseudotyped with different envelope glycoproteins such as the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope (VSVG), the gibbon ape leukaemia virus envelope (GaLV) or the feline endogenous virus envelope (RD114). At the same time, we evaluated transgene expression (E-GFP reporter gene) under the control of different promoters. RESULTS: We found that efficient gene transfer into pDC can be achieved with VSVG-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (LV) under the control of phoshoglycerate kinase (PGK) and elongation factor-1 (EF1alpha) promoters (28% to 90% of E-GFP+ cells, respectively) in the absence of phenotypic and functional maturation. Surprisingly, promoters (desmin or synthetic C5-12) described as muscle-specific and which drive gene expression in single strand AAV vectors in gene therapy protocols were very highly active in pDC using VSVG-LV. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate that LV vectors can serve to design pDC-based vaccines in humans, and they are also useful in vitro to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vector preparations, and the specificity and safety of given promoters used in gene therapy protocols.","['Veron, Philippe', 'Boutin, Sylvie', 'Martin, Samia', 'Chaperot, Laurence', 'Plumas, Joel', 'Davoust, Jean', 'Masurier, Carole']","['Veron P', 'Boutin S', 'Martin S', 'Chaperot L', 'Plumas J', 'Davoust J', 'Masurier C']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, GENETHON, CNRS UMR 8115, Evry Cedex, France. veron@genethon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,,IM,"['Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Phenotype', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2009/01/29 09:00,2009/06/30 09:00,['2009/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-7-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-7-10 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2009 Jan 27;7:10. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-7-10.,10.1186/1479-5876-7-10 [doi],20090127,,PMC2657113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the proposed scheme, the randomization probabilities are unbalanced adaptively in favor of treatments with superior joint outcomes characterized by higher efficacy and lower toxicity. This type of scheme is advantageous from the patients' perspective because on average, more patients are randomized to superior treatments. We extend the approximate Bayesian time-to-event model in Cheung and Thall (2002, Biometrics 58, 89-97) to model the joint efficacy/toxicity outcomes and perform posterior computation based on a latent variable approach. Consequently, this allows us to incorporate essential information about patients with incomplete follow-up. Based on the computed posterior probabilities, we propose an AR scheme that favors the treatments with larger joint probabilities of efficacy and no toxicity. We illustrate our methodology with a leukemia trial that compares three treatments in terms of their 52-week molecular remission rates and 52-week toxicity rates.","['Ji, Yuan', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou']","['Ji Y', 'Bekele BN']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Biometry/*methods', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Endpoint Determination/*methods', 'Humans', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods', '*Proportional Hazards Models', '*Research Design', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/29 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/01/29 09:00'],"['2009/01/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BIOM1175 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01175.x [doi]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 2009 Sep;65(3):876-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01175.x.

A fixed effects meta-analysis examining the association between birth weight and childhood leukemia was conducted including 32 studies and 16,501 cases of all types of leukemia (OL), 10,974 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 1,832 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The odd ratios (OR) for the association of high birth weight with OL, ALL and AML were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.48), 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.32), and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.76), respectively, compared with normal birth weight. Low birth weight was not associated with overall and ALL leukemia, but with AML (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.13). Per 1000 g increase in birth weight, the OR for OL was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.23) and ALL 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.23). The combined available evidence from observational studies suggests that high birth weight is associated with an increased risk of overall leukemia and ALL. For AML the risk may be elevated at both high and low extremes of birth weight, suggesting a U-shaped association.","['Caughey, Robert W', 'Michels, Karin B']","['Caughey RW', 'Michels KB']","['Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['*Birth Weight', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology']",2009/01/29 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/01/29 09:00'],"['2009/01/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24225 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jun 1;124(11):2658-70. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24225.,10.1002/ijc.24225 [doi],,,,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, although mechanisms regulating avian erythroid chromatin condensation have been identified, little is known regarding this process during mammalian erythropoiesis. To elucidate the molecular basis for mammalian erythroblast chromatin condensation, we used Friend virus-infected murine spleen erythroblasts that undergo terminal differentiation in vitro. Chromatin isolated from early and late-stage erythroblasts had similar levels of linker and core histones, only a slight difference in nucleosome repeats, and no significant accumulation of known developmentally regulated architectural chromatin proteins. However, histone H3(K9) dimethylation markedly increased while histone H4(K12) acetylation dramatically decreased and became segregated from the histone methylation as chromatin condensed.

Since ATGs contain antibodies against antigens expressed on various hematopoetic cells, it is not surprising that they induce cell death not only in healthy T-, B-, NK, and dendritic cells but also in malignant cells of lymphatic and to a lesser extent of myeloid lineage. The cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of ATGs in malignant B-cells have been known for many years, without attracting clinical attention due to the advent of monoclonal antibodies like rituximab. Recent data indicate a potential role of ATGs in the therapy of multiple myeloma, a disease in which monoclonal serotherapy has been rather unsuccessful.

We retrospectively analyzed the results of the autoHSCT and maintenance therapy, with oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, in comparison to conventional-dose chemotherapy in the consolidation treatment of adult ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). The patients, with HLA identical sibling donor, underwent allogeneic transplantation, while the others were treated with autoHSCT and maintenance therapy with oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, or by conventional-dose chemotherapy (patient's decision, no autologous hematopoietic stem cells harvest). Sixty consecutive adult patients (median age 35.2 years; range 17.3 to 70.7) with ALL (n = 52), LBL (n = 7), and acute biphenotypic leukemia (n = 1) were treated in our center from 1997 to 2007. Patients treated with chemotherapy alone (n = 35) had a shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients who underwent autoHSCT plus maintenance therapy (n = 18), 8.4 and 46.8 months, respectively (p = 0.017). Patients treated with chemotherapy alone had also a shorter median overall survival (OS) compared to patients treated with autoHSCT: 13.0 vs. 46.8 months (p = 0.046). The differences remained statistically significant even after excluding patients with Ph positivity. We can conclude that, in our case, autoHSCT followed by maintenance chemotherapy is a good option for adult patients with ALL and, in standard-risk and high-risk patients, provides more favorable OS and PFS rates compared to patients treated by chemotherapy alone. However, we are aware of the fact that our analysis may have been distorted by the fact that the analysis is retrospective, that treatment with autoHSCT was based on patient's decision, and that chemotherapy may have been administered to negatively selected patients.","['Doubek, Michael', 'Folber, Frantisek', 'Koristek, Zdenek', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Krejci, Marta', 'Tomiska, Miroslav', 'Navratil, Milan', 'Mikulasova, Petra', 'Mayer, Jiri']","['Doubek M', 'Folber F', 'Koristek Z', 'Brychtova Y', 'Krejci M', 'Tomiska M', 'Navratil M', 'Mikulasova P', 'Mayer J']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematooncology, University Hospital in Brno and Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. mdoubek@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/28 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/01/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0700-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Sep;88(9):881-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0700-3.

We show here that papuamide A acts as an entry inhibitor, preventing human immunodeficiency virus infection of host cells and that this inhibition is not specific to R5 or X4 tropic virus. This inhibition of viral entry was determined to not be due to papuamide A binding to CD4 or HIV gp120, the two proteins involved in the cell-virus recognition and binding. Furthermore, papuamide A was able to inhibit HIV pseudotype viruses expressing envelope glycoproteins from vesicular stomatitis virus or amphotropic murine leukemia virus indicating the mechanism of viral entry inhibition is not HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein specific. Time delayed addition studies with the pseudotyped viruses show that papuamide A inhibits viral infection only at the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Additionally, pretreatment studies revealed that the virus, and not the cell, is the target of papuamide A's action. Together, these results suggest a direct virucidal mechanism of HIV-1 inhibition by papuamide A. We also demonstrate here that the other papuamides (B-D) are able to inhibit viral entry indicating that the free amino moiety of 2,3-diaminobutanoic acid residue is not required for the virucidal activity.","['Andjelic, Cynthia D', 'Planelles, Vicente', 'Barrows, Louis R']","['Andjelic CD', 'Planelles V', 'Barrows LR']","['University of Utah, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 30 S. 2000 E.

Ectopic LMO2 expression causes leukemia in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients and severe combined immunodeficiency patients undergoing retroviral gene therapy. Tightly controlled Lmo2 expression is therefore essential, yet no comprehensive analysis of Lmo2 regulation has been published so far. By comparative genomics, we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation. All candidate regulatory regions were tested in transgenic mice. An extended LMO2 proximal promoter fragment displayed strong endothelial activity, while the distal promoter showed weak forebrain activity. Eight of the 15 distal candidate elements functioned as enhancers, which together recapitulated the full expression pattern of Lmo2, directing expression to endothelium, hematopoietic cells, tail, and forebrain. Interestingly, distinct combinations of specific distal regulatory elements were required to extend endothelial activity of the LMO2 promoter to yolk sac or fetal liver hematopoietic cells. Finally, Sfpi1/Pu.1, Fli1, Gata2, Tal1/Scl, and Lmo2 were shown to bind to and transactivate Lmo2 hematopoietic enhancers, thus identifying key upstream regulators and positioning Lmo2 within hematopoietic regulatory networks.","['Landry, Josette-Renee', 'Bonadies, Nicolas', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Wilson, Nicola K', 'Oram, S Helen', 'Janes, Mary', 'Piltz, Sandie', 'Hammett, Michelle', 'Carter, Jacinta', 'Hamilton, Tina', 'Donaldson, Ian J', 'Lacaud, Georges', 'Frampton, Jonathan', 'Follows, George', 'Kouskoff, Valerie', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Landry JR', 'Bonadies N', 'Kinston S', 'Knezevic K', 'Wilson NK', 'Oram SH', 'Janes M', 'Piltz S', 'Hammett M', 'Carter J', 'Hamilton T', 'Donaldson IJ', 'Lacaud G', 'Frampton J', 'Follows G', 'Kouskoff V', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/embryology/metabolism', 'GATA Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome/genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",2009/01/28 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/01/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37333-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-187757 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 4;113(23):5783-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-187757.

However, the mechanism of diabetes amelioration by imatinib is unknown, and it is uncertain whether imatinib has effects on type 2 diabetes itself without other confounding diseases like leukemia. We studied the effect of imatinib on diabetes in db/db mice and investigated possible mechanism's underlying improved glycemic control by imatinib. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were done after daily intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg imatinib into db/db and C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks. Insulin signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses were studied by Western blotting. beta-Cell mass and apoptotic beta-cell number were determined by combined terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and insulin immunohistochemistry. The in vitro effect of imatinib was studied using HepG2 cells. RESULTS: Imatinib induced remission of diabetes in db/db mice and amelioration of insulin resistance. Expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers in the liver and adipose tissues of db/db mice, such as phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2alpha, TRB3, CHOP, and phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, was reduced by imatinib. Insulin receptor substrate-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation after insulin administration were improved by imatinib. Serum aminotransferase levels and hepatic triglyceride contents were decreased by imatinib. Pancreatic beta-cell mass was increased by imatinib, accompanied by decreased TUNEL(+) beta-cell and increased BrdU(+) beta-cell numbers. Imatinib attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatoma cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib ameliorated endoplasmic reticulum stress and induced remission of diabetes in db/db mice. Imatinib or related compounds could be used as therapeutic agents against type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.","['Han, Myoung Sook', 'Chung, Kun Wook', 'Cheon, Hyae Gyeong', 'Rhee, Sang Dal', 'Yoon, Chang-Hwan', 'Lee, Moon-Kyu', 'Kim, Kwang-Won', 'Lee, Myung-Shik']","['Han MS', 'Chung KW', 'Cheon HG', 'Rhee SD', 'Yoon CH', 'Lee MK', 'Kim KW', 'Lee MS']","['Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TRB3 protein, mouse)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/*therapy', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",2009/01/28 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2009/01/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']","['db08-0080 [pii]', '10.2337/db08-0080 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2009 Feb;58(2):329-36. doi: 10.2337/db08-0080.,10.2337/db08-0080 [doi],,,PMC2628605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trial-specific factors, such as subject selection, study design, and execution strategy, have an impact on the outcome of trials. In multiple trials, they may lead to heterogeneity that can be taken into account in the (random effects) meta-analysis. Single trials lack this method of estimating the impact of such factors, and this affects the credibility of the results. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: To indicate how much the precision of the results of a single trial might be overestimated, we calculated the ratio of the widths of the confidence intervals when heterogeneity was taken into account and when it was not. RESULTS: The ratios of the widths of the confidence intervals with and without between-study variability were 1.15, 1.41, and 2.00, when the heterogeneity I(2) values were 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of a single trial should be interpreted with caution.

The mechanisms controlling ESC self-renewal are under intense investigation, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in regulating both self-renewal and differentiation. To clarify its role in ESCs we have used chemical genetics. We synthesized a series of bisindolylmaleimides, a subset of which inhibit GSK-3 in murine ESCs and robustly enhance self-renewal in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum, but not in the absence of LIF. Importantly, these molecules appear selective for GSK-3 and do not perturb other signaling pathways regulating self-renewal. Our study clarifies the functional importance of GSK-3 in regulation of ESC self-renewal and provides tools for investigating its role further.","['Bone, Heather K', 'Damiano, Teresa', 'Bartlett, Stephen', 'Perry, Alexis', 'Letchford, Julie', 'Ripoll, Yolanda Sanchez', 'Nelson, Adam S', 'Welham, Melanie J']","['Bone HK', 'Damiano T', 'Bartlett S', 'Perry A', 'Letchford J', 'Ripoll YS', 'Nelson AS', 'Welham MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Bath, Bath, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Maleimides)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Maleimides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice']",2009/01/28 09:00,2009/03/28 09:00,['2009/01/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S1074-5521(08)00449-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2009 Jan 30;16(1):15-27. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.11.003.,10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.11.003 [doi],,"['BB/C516528/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBC51390X1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBC5165281/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize hematologic abnormalities and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) results in cases of hematopoietic neoplasia in dogs. METHODS: Signalment, CBC data, and FCI results were obtained for 210 dogs with blood samples submitted to our laboratory. Immunophenotyping was carried out using an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer and a panel of 10 antibodies (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD79, CD21, CD14, CD34, CD41/61, CD61). The prevalence and severity of hematologic abnormalities was determined for the different types of hematopoietic neoplasms. RESULTS: Based on cell morphology and phenotype, cases were classified as: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=51), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=33), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n=61), and leukemic high-grade lymphoma (L-HGL, n=65). Most cases of ALL (47/51) and L-HGL (41/65) had a B-cell phenotype, while most cases of CLL (54/61) had a T-cell phenotype, with a high prevalence of the large granular lymphocyte subtype (49/61). Anemia was found in 85% of all cases and was significantly more severe in ALL and AML compared with CLL and L-HGL. Neutropenia was seen in 64-78% of acute leukemias (AML and ALL) in contrast to no cases of CLL and 11% of L-HGL. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 88-90% of acute leukemias in contrast to 15% of CLL and 40% of L-HGL. Thrombocytopenia was more prevalent (71% vs 22%) and significantly more severe in T-cell vs B-cell L-HGL. CONCLUSION: A standard CBC is useful in suggesting the type of hemoproliferative disorder and may also help to predict the phenotype, especially in cases of L-HGL.","['Tasca, Silvia', 'Carli, Erika', 'Caldin, Marco', 'Menegazzo, Lucia', 'Furlanello, Tommaso', 'Gallego, Laia Solano']","['Tasca S', 'Carli E', 'Caldin M', 'Menegazzo L', 'Furlanello T', 'Gallego LS']","['Private Veterinary Clinic, San Marco, Padua, Italy. silvia.tasca@sanmarcover.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dog Diseases/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*veterinary', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/*veterinary', 'Male']",2009/01/28 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/01/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']","['VCP99 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-165X.2008.00099.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2009 Mar;38(1):2-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165X.2008.00099.x.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual patient data-based meta-analysis was conducted with a pooled data set provided through six published and one unpublished cohorts. Outcomes in recipients of peripheral blood or bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies were evaluated. A multivariate Cox model was used to adjust differences in outcomes of patients receiving ABO-matched grafts with those receiving major, minor, or bidirectional mismatched grafts. Considering multiple testing, p values of less than 0.05 and 0.001 were considered significant for the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. RESULTS: In all, 1208 cases, including 697 ABO-matched and 202 major, 228 minor, and 81 bidirectional mismatched transplants, were analyzed. Overall, adverse impact of ABO matching on overall survival (OS), as a primary endpoint, was not observed (adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals]: major, 1.03 [0.82-1.30], p = 0.81; minor, 1.19 [0.97-1.47], p = 0.10; bidirectional, 1.25 [0.91-1.72], p = 0.17). Among related stem cell recipients, ABO matching had no significant influence on OS, while the minor and bidirectional mismatched groups among unrelated stem cell recipients exhibited lower OS with marginal significance, especially in patients with acute leukemia, patients who received transplants after 1998, and patients who underwent transplants at Asian centers. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates no adverse association between any ABO mismatching and survival. However, marginally lower OS found in recipients of minor or bidirectional mismatched grafts from unrelated donors suggested the need for larger studies focusing on unrelated transplants.","['Kanda, Junya', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Benjamin, Richard J', 'Klumpp, Thomas R', 'Rozman, Primoz', 'Blumberg, Neil', 'Mehta, Jayesh', 'Sohn, Sang-Kyun', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Kanda J', 'Ichinohe T', 'Matsuo K', 'Benjamin RJ', 'Klumpp TR', 'Rozman P', 'Blumberg N', 'Mehta J', 'Sohn SK', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. jkanda16@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Algorithms', 'Blood Cells/immunology/physiology', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching/*adverse effects/methods/mortality', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/physiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', '*Databases, Factual', 'Family', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/mortality', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/01/28 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2009/01/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]']","['TRF02043 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.02043.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2009 Apr;49(4):624-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.02043.x.

A nuclear factor kappaB inhibition assay revealed a half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 0.9 micromol/l. The WST-1 growth assay showed inhibition of cell growth of all tested multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines with an IC(50) between 100 nmol/l and 600 nmol/l. Strong induction of apoptosis was seen in MM cells at nanomolar concentrations (IC(50) approximately 300 nm) as well as in primary myeloma cells. No induction of apoptosis was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy humans. Upregulation of p53, activation of JNK protein, and downregulation of Mcl-1 was revealed. Despite the administration of 15 mg S-2209/kg/d in wistar rats, no toxicity with respect to body weight, hepatic enzymes, creatinine or haemoglobin was seen. Proteasome inhibition in white blood cells isolated from the treated rats was higher in the S-2209 treated animals in comparison with the control animals treated with 0.1 mg/kg/d bortezomib. S-2209 is active in myeloma cells and shows a favourable toxicity profile in first in-vivo studies.

METHODS: In total, 245 survivors (78% of eligible patients) who were 9.4 to 16.5 years postdiagnosis (mean, 12.5 years postdiagnosis) completed HRQL surveys relating to 5 domains. Analyses examined HRQL domains according to 3 different chemotherapy dose levels that were administered in the original treatment trial: low-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) at 300 mg/m(2), 30 mg/m(2), and 300 x 2 mg/m(2), respectively, over 4 cycles; standard-dose CAF at 400 mg/m(2), 40 mg/m(2), and 400 x 2 mg/m(2), respectively, over 6 cycles; and high-dose CAF at 600 mg/m(2), 60 mg/m(2) and 600 x 2 mg/m(2), respectively, over 4 cycles. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, a statistically significant difference was observed on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form Physical Role Functioning subscale by treatment group, with lower mean scores in the standard treatment arm (mean, 65.05) compared with mean scores in the low-dose arm (mean, 74.66) and the high-dose arm (mean, 84.94; P.0001). However, multivariate analysis revealed that treatment arm no longer was statistically significant, whereas the following factors were associated with decreased physical role functioning: age >or=60 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.55; P = .006), increased comorbidity interference total score (OR, 1.64; P = .005), lower vitality (OR, 1.05; P = .0002), and increased menopausal symptoms (OR, 1.04 P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: At 9.4-16.5 years after their original diagnosis, differences in physical role functioning among breast cancer survivors who had received 3 different dose levels of chemotherapy were explained by clinical and demographic variables, such as age, fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and comorbidities. Prospective studies are needed to further assess the role of these factors in explaining HRQL and physical role functioning among long-term survivors.","['Paskett, Electra', 'Herndon, James 2nd', 'Donohue, Kathleen', 'Naughton, Michelle', 'Grubbs, Stephen', 'Pavy, Michael', 'Hensley, Martee', 'Stark, Nancy', 'Kornblith, Alice', 'Bittoni, Marisa']","['Paskett E', 'Herndon J 2nd', 'Donohue K', 'Naughton M', 'Grubbs S', 'Pavy M', 'Hensley M', 'Stark N', 'Kornblith A', 'Bittoni M']","['College of Public Health and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, 320 West 10th Avenue, Starling Loving Hall A356, Columbus, OH 43210-1240, USA. electra.paskett@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CAV protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Comorbidity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24140 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Mar 1;115(5):1109-20. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24140.,10.1002/cncr.24140 [doi],,"['R01 AG016602-04/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG16602/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA057707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2737348,,,,,['NIHMS89210'],,['for Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,['(c) 2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

We used the MM cell line RPMI-8226 to evaluate the relationship between duration of SNS-032 exposure, target modulation of CDKs 2, 7 and 9, and induction of apoptosis. We also assessed target modulation in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from phase 1 solid tumor patients treated with SNS-032. METHODS: Proliferation and colony forming assays were used to evaluate cytotoxicity, Western blot analyses to evaluate target modulation, FACS analysis to assess cell cycle distribution, RT-PCR to evaluate transcriptional inhibition. RESULTS: SNS-032 blocks the cell cycle via inhibition of CDKs 2 and 7, and transcription via inhibition of CDKs 7 and 9. Treatment of RPMI-8226 MM cells at 300 nM (IC(90)) for 6 h was sufficient for commitment to apoptosis. This correlated with inhibition of CDKs 2, 7 and 9, as reflected in substrate signaling molecules. SNS-032 activity was unaffected by human serum. Target modulation was observed in PBMC from treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate SNS-032 target modulation of CDKs 2, 7 and 9, and establish 6 h exposure as sufficient to commit RPMI-8226 MM cells to apoptosis. Combined with the demonstration of target modulation in PBMC from phase 1 solid tumor patients treated with SNS-032, these data support the ongoing clinical study of SNS-032 in MM and CLL.","['Conroy, Andrew', 'Stockett, David E', 'Walker, Duncan', 'Arkin, Michelle R', 'Hoch, Ute', 'Fox, Judith A', 'Hawtin, Rachael Elizabeth']","['Conroy A', 'Stockett DE', 'Walker D', 'Arkin MR', 'Hoch U', 'Fox JA', 'Hawtin RE']","['Sunesis Pharmaceuticals Inc, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0', '(N-(5-(((5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-oxazolyl)methyl)thio)-2-thiazolyl)-4-piperidinec', 'arboxamide)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0921-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Sep;64(4):723-32. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0921-5.

Here we show that the loss of Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway, impairs haematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells--the cells that propagate the leukaemia--whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb, which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Hh signalling impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wild-type BCR-ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. These data indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the haematopoietic system and raise the possibility that the drug resistance and disease recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML might be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.","['Zhao, Chen', 'Chen, Alan', 'Jamieson, Catriona H', 'Fereshteh, Mark', 'Abrahamsson, Annelie', 'Blum, Jordan', 'Kwon, Hyog Young', 'Kim, Jynho', 'Chute, John P', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Munchhof, Michael', 'VanArsdale, Todd', 'Beachy, Philip A', 'Reya, Tannishtha']","['Zhao C', 'Chen A', 'Jamieson CH', 'Fereshteh M', 'Abrahamsson A', 'Blum J', 'Kwon HY', 'Kim J', 'Chute JP', 'Rizzieri D', 'Munchhof M', 'VanArsdale T', 'Beachy PA', 'Reya T']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Numb protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Smo protein, mouse)', '0 (Smoothened Receptor)', '0 (Veratrum Alkaloids)', '2B73S48786 (tomatidine)', '31U6547O08 (Tomatine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'ZH658AJ192 (cyclopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smoothened Receptor', 'Tomatine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Veratrum Alkaloids/pharmacology']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']","['nature07737 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07737 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Apr 9;458(7239):776-9. doi: 10.1038/nature07737.,10.1038/nature07737 [doi],,"['R01 DK072234-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK072234/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072234/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-07/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798-020006/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-01S1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072234-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798-040006/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-07S1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AI067798/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798-010006/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798-050006/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK63031/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-06/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072234-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798-030006/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072234-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2946231,,['Nature. 2009 Jul 30;460(7255):652'],,,['NIHMS235138'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta) is an essential signaling element of the BCR and was recently shown to be overexpressed in human CLL. We used the TCL1 transgenic mouse model to directly target PKCbeta in the development of murine CLL. TCL1 overexpression did restore the CD5(+) B-cell population that is absent in PKCbeta-deficient mice. However, PKCbeta-deleted TCL1 transgenic mice did not develop a CLL disease, suggesting a role of PKCbeta in the establishment of the malignant clone. Moreover, targeting of PKCbeta with the specific inhibitor enzastaurin led to killing of human CLL samples in vitro.

People with Down syndrome (DS), who are trisomic for Hsa21, are predisposed to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). DS-AMKL blasts harbor a mutation in GATA1, which leads to loss of full-length protein but expression of the GATA-1s isoform. To assess the consequences of ETS protein misexpression on megakaryopoiesis, we expressed ETS2, ERG, and the related protein FLI-1 in wild-type and Gata1 mutant murine fetal liver progenitors. These studies revealed that ETS2, ERG, and FLI-1 facilitated the expansion of megakaryocytes from wild-type, Gata1-knockdown, and Gata1s knockin progenitors, but none of the genes could overcome the differentiation block characteristic of the Gata1-knockdown megakaryocytes. Although overexpression of ETS proteins increased the proportion of CD41(+) cells generated from Gata1s-knockin progenitors, their expression led to a significant reduction in the more mature CD42 fraction. Serial replating assays revealed that overexpression of ERG or FLI-1 immortalized Gata1-knockdown and Gata1s knockin, but not wild-type, fetal liver progenitors. Immortalization was accompanied by activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, commonly seen in megakaryocytic malignancies. These findings provide evidence for synergy between alterations in GATA-1 and overexpression of ETS proteins in aberrant megakaryopoiesis.","['Stankiewicz, Monika J', 'Crispino, John D']","['Stankiewicz MJ', 'Crispino JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Ets2 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Fetus/metabolism/physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology/physiology', 'Liver/embryology/metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39394-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-174813 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 2;113(14):3337-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174813.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had previously untreated measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of zero to two and creatinine clearance >50 ml/min. Treatment consisted of cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 given every 3 weeks concurrent with gefitinib 500 mg/day orally for six cycles. Maintenance gefitinib 500 mg/day was continued for responding or stable disease. RESULTS: Fifty-four of 58 patients were assessable. Twelve patients (22%) had node-only disease, and 25 (46%) had an ECOG performance status of zero. There were 23 objective responses for an overall response rate of 42.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 29.2% to 56.8%]. The median survival time was 15.1 months (95% CI 11.1-21.7 months) and the median time to progression was 7.4 months (95% CI 5.6-9.2 months). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin, gemcitabine and gefitinib is well tolerated and active in advanced transitional cell carcinoma. The addition of gefitinib does not appear to improve response rate or survival in comparison to historical controls of cisplatin and gemcitabine alone.","['Philips, G K', 'Halabi, S', 'Sanford, B L', 'Bajorin, D', 'Small, E J']","['Philips GK', 'Halabi S', 'Sanford BL', 'Bajorin D', 'Small EJ']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405, USA. george.philips@vtmednet.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage', 'Urologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)41063-6 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn749 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2009 Jun;20(6):1074-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn749.

However, many patients have no human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor. Recently, we developed a new method for HLA-mismatched/haploidentical transplantation without in vitro T cell depletion (TCD). This method combined granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-primed bone marrow and peripheral blood with intensive immunosuppression. We analyzed the outcome of 250 consecutive patients with AL who underwent HLA-mismatched/haploidentical transplantation with 1-3 mismatched loci of HLA-A, B, and DR from family donors via our new transplant protocol. Two hundred forty-nine patients achieved sustained, full donor chimerism. The incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 45.8%, and that of grades 3 and 4 was 13.4%, which was not associated with the extent of HLA disparity. The cumulative incidence of total chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 53.9% and that of extensive cGVHD was 22.6% in 217 evaluable patients. One hundred forty-one of the 250 patients survived free of disease recurrence at a median of 1092 days (range: 442-2437 days) of follow-up. Seventeen patients received DLI as a treatment for relapse after transplantation and 7 patients achieved leukemia-free survival (LFS). The 3-year probability of LFS for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was 70.7% and 55.9%, and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) it was 59.7% and 24.8% in standard-risk and high-risk groups, respectively. Lower LFS were associated with diagnosis of acute leukemia in the high-risk group (P= .001, relative risk [RR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.94[1.535-5.631]) and the occurrence of aGVHD of grades 3 and 4 (P= .004).

In this study we investigated the complement independent induction of apoptosis by rabbit ATG in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) compartments and hematopoetic stem cells (HSC). We also detected antileukemic activity of ATG by measuring apoptosis in myeloid and lymphatic leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells. We found ATG to induce apoptosis in T-lymphocytes (CD4(+), CD8+), B-lymphocytes (CD20+), natural killer (NK)-cells (CD56(+)), and monocytes (CD14(+)). HSC, in contrast, were apoptosis resistant and could be growth stimulated by low-dose ATG in the presence of bystander cells. The human leukemia cell lines Jurkat, Daudi, DG-75 (lymphoblastic), and K562, HL-60, KG1, and U937 (myeloblastic) underwent ATG-induced apoptosis, whereas the NK-cell line YT was resistant. Primary leukemia cells from 6 investigated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 9 of 10 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 4 of 8 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia underwent ATG-induced apoptosis. We conclude apoptosis induction in all PBMNC compartments contributes to GVHD prophylaxis. ATG might support engraftment.

Included in the analysis were 113 consecutive samples received in our laboratory between January 2005 and June 2007. Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples were characterized using conventional G-banding techniques and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques with commercially available RUNX1/RUNX1T1 or ETV6/RUNX1 dual-color fusion probes. Eighty-one (72%) of the 113 samples showed an abnormal karyotype and/or abnormal FISH results. Eight of these had, by interphase FISH, RUNX1/RUNX1T1 or RUNX1/ETV6 fusion, and 19 had three or more RUNX1 signals not related to fusion with RUNX1T1 or ETV6 gene. Of the 19 cases with multiple RUNX1 gene signals, 5 had high-level RUNX1 amplification--defined as 5 or more RUNX1 signals in interphase cells--whereas the remaining 14 had 3-4 RUNX1 signals. Four of the five tumors with high-level RUNX1 amplification were myeloid disorders--three cases of AML and one case of MDS. The karyotypes of tumors with high-level amplification of RUNX1 were significantly characterized by the presence of marker chromosomes that harbored extra copies of the RUNX1 gene compared with tumors that had three to four RUNX1 gene signals (P=0.026, Fisher's exact test). Our findings show that high-level RUNX1 amplification, especially in myeloid disorders, often results from marker chromosomes harboring extra copies of the RUNX1 gene . This suggests that amplification of RUNX1 in these tumors may be secondary to a previous rearrangement of 21q22, which later evolved into a complex marker chromosome as part of tumor progression.","['Moosavi, Seyed A', 'Sanchez, Jessica', 'Adeyinka, Adewale']","['Moosavi SA', 'Sanchez J', 'Adeyinka A']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Lawrence Technological University, 21000 West Ten Mile Road, Southfield, MI 48075, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2008/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(08)00578-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Feb;189(1):24-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.10.001.,10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.10.001 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 12 patients who presented with proptosis and were subsequently diagnosed to have acute myeloid leukemia based on incision biopsy or peripheral blood smear were included in the study. RESULTS: A retrospective review of all cases of acute myeloid leukemia presenting to the Orbital clinic was performed. The age at presentation, gender, presenting features, duration of symptoms and fundus features were noted. In addition the temporal relationship of the orbital disease to the diagnosis of leukemia, laterality, location of the orbital mass, imaging features and the diagnostic tools used to diagnose leukemia were noted. The median age at presentation was 6 years. The male: female ratio was 0.7:1. None of these patients had been diagnosed earlier as having acute myeloid leukemia. The presenting features included proptosis in all patients, orbital mass in 5 (41.7%), visual symptoms in 2 (16.7%) and subconjunctival hemorrhage in one patient (8.3%). A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was established by incision biopsy in 4 patients, subsequently confirmed by peripheral blood smear testing and bone marrow biopsy in 2 patients which revealed the presence of systemic involvement. Imprint smears of the biopsy identified blasts in 2 of 4 cases. In 8 patients presenting with ocular manifestations, diagnosis was established by peripheral blood smear examination alone which revealed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: A peripheral blood smear should be performed in all cases of sudden onset proptosis or an orbital mass in children and young adults along with an orbital biopsy. It can always be complemented with a bone marrow biopsy especially in cases of aleukemic leukemia or when the blood smear is inconclusive.","['Murthy, Ramesh', 'Vemuganti, Geeta K', 'Honavar, Santosh G', 'Naik, Milind', 'Reddy, Vijayanand']","['Murthy R', 'Vemuganti GK', 'Honavar SG', 'Naik M', 'Reddy V']","['Ocular Pathology, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Kallam Anji Reddy Campus, Hyderabad, India. drrameshmurthy@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exophthalmos/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Eye/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/01/27 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2008/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jan 24;2:4. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-4.,10.1186/1756-8722-2-4 [doi],20090124,,PMC2651909,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein appears to promote elevated expression of HOXA cluster genes in T-ALL and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. We screened a panel of ALL and AML cell lines for SET-NUP214 expression to find model systems that might help to elucidate the cellular function of this fusion gene. RESULTS: Of 141 human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines tested, only the T-ALL cell line LOUCY and the AML cell line MEGAL expressed the SET(TAF-Ibeta)-NUP214 fusion gene transcript. RT-PCR analysis specifically recognizing the alternative first exons of the two TAF-I isoforms revealed that the cell lines also expressed TAF-Ialpha-NUP214 mRNA. Results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array-based copy number analysis were both consistent with del(9)(q34.11q34.13) as described. Quantitative genomic PCR also confirmed loss of genomic material between SET and NUP214 in both cell lines. Genomic sequencing localized the breakpoints of the SET gene to regions downstream of the stop codon and to NUP214 intron 17/18 in both LOUCY and MEGAL cells. Both cell lines expressed the 140 kDa SET-NUP214 fusion protein. CONCLUSION: Cell lines LOUCY and MEGAL express the recently described SET-NUP214 fusion gene. Of special note is that the formation of the SET exon 7/NUP214 exon 18 gene transcript requires alternative splicing as the SET breakpoint is located downstream of the stop codon in exon 8. The cell lines are promising model systems for SET-NUP214 studies and should facilitate investigating cellular functions of the the SET-NUP214 protein.","['Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Schneider, Bjorn', 'Rohrs, Sonja', 'Romani, Julia', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Macleod, Roderick A F', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Schneider B', 'Rohrs S', 'Romani J', 'Zaborski M', 'Macleod RA', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Testing', 'Histone Chaperones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/01/27 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2008/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jan 23;2:3. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-3.,10.1186/1756-8722-2-3 [doi],20090123,,PMC2636835,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we searched for potential physiological ligands for Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs that could be involved in modulating the survival of lymphoblasts. Accordingly, we examined the presence of binding proteins for Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs on cell lines and primary cells of patients with B- and T-ALL, at presentation of the disease. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal healthy donors and cells from myeloid leukemia patients were used for comparison. Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs-binding proteins (BPs) were specifically detected on the surface of both T- and B-ALL-lymphoblasts and ALL-cell lines along with the consistent presence of Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs. The Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs and BPs also co-localized on the cell surface and interacted specifically in vitro. Apoptosis of lymphoblasts, induced by serum starvation, was reversed in the presence of purified Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs due to possible engagement of BPs, and the anti-apoptotic role of this interaction was established. This is the first report of the presence of potential physiological ligands for disease-associated molecules like Neu5,9Ac(2)GPs, the interaction of which is able to trigger an anti-apoptotic signal conferring a survival advantage to leukemic cells in childhood ALL.","['Mukherjee, Kankana', 'Chava, Anil K', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Mallick, Asish', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Mukherjee K', 'Chava AK', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Mallick A', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C']","['Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.C.

To obtain insight in the contribution of activated kinases to the pathogenesis ofT-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we studied the NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene that is found in 6% of T-ALL and EML1-ABL1 that we identified in one T-ALL patient. NUP214-ABL1 and EML1-ABL1 display constitutive kinase activity and are sensitive to the kinase inhibitor imatinib. Both proteins transform hematopoietic cells and we established mouse models of EML1-ABL1 and NUP214-ABL1 induced T-ALL. Interestingly, whereas EML1-ABL1 activity requires homo-oligomerization via its coiled coil domain, activity of NUP214-ABL1 depends on its cellular localization to the nuclear pore complexes. These results for NUP214-ABL1 delineate a novel mechanism for fusion kinase activation in cancer and provide new options to interfere with NUP214-ABL1 activity. T-ALL development requires accumulation of different mutations. Little is known about the cooperation between the mutations and about their sequence of accumulation. We provide evidence that tyrosine kinase mutations occur late in T-ALL development, suggesting limited potential for kinase inhibitor monotherapy. We therefore combined NUP214-ABL1 inhibition with other therapies and show that inhibition of NUP214-ABL1 and NOTCH1 in vitro can result in synergistic effects. Further validation of these and other combination therapies requires animal models containing several of the mutations in T-ALL and thus reflecting the multistep oncogenic process of human T-ALL genesis. The models for ABL1 fusion induced T-ALL will serve as starting point here.","['De Keersmaecker, K']",['De Keersmaecker K'],"['Center for Human Genetics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, VIB Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, Campus Gasthuisberg O&N1 box 602, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Belgium,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg,Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie,0413210,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (EML1-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2009/01/27 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2009/01/27 09:00'],"['2009/01/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg. 2008;70(4):245-55.,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shikonin, a natural naphthoquinone isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Zi Cao (gromwell), has been reported to possess tumor cell-killing activity, and results from a clinical study using a shikonin-containing mixture demonstrated its safety and efficacy for the treatment of late-stage lung cancer. In this study, we reported that shikonin is an inhibitor of tumor proteasome activity in vitro and in vivo. Our computational modeling predicts that the carbonyl carbons C(1) and C(4) of shikonin potentially interact with the catalytic site of beta 5 chymotryptic subunit of the proteasome. Indeed, shikonin potently inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome (IC(50) 12.5 micromol/L) and tumor cellular 26S proteasome (IC(50) between 2-16 micromol/L). Inhibition of the proteasome by shikonin in murine hepatoma H22, leukemia P388 and human prostate cancer PC-3 cultures resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and several proteasome target proapoptotic proteins (I kappaB-alpha, Bax and p27), followed by induction of cell death. Shikonin treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition in both H22 allografts and PC-3 xenografts, associated with suppression of the proteasomal activity and induction of cell death in vivo. Finally, shikonin treatment significantly prolonged the survival period of mice bearing P388 leukemia. Our results indicate that the tumor proteasome is one of the cellular targets of shikonin and inhibition of the proteasome activity by shikonin contributes to its antitumor property.","['Yang, Huanjie', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Huang, Hongbiao', 'Chen, Di', 'Ma, Ningfang', 'Cui, Qiuzhi Cindy', 'Shen, Shouxing', 'Dong, Weihua', 'Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Lian, Wen', 'Wang, Xuejun', 'Dou, Q Ping', 'Liu, Jinbao']","['Yang H', 'Zhou P', 'Huang H', 'Chen D', 'Ma N', 'Cui QC', 'Shen S', 'Dong W', 'Zhang X', 'Lian W', 'Wang X', 'Dou QP', 'Liu J']","[""Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Molecular', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Survival Rate']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24195 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 May 15;124(10):2450-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24195.,10.1002/ijc.24195 [doi],,"['R01 CA120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120009-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL072166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2707765,,,,,['NIHMS98736'],,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

This paper describes the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical findings of 52 cases of ATL with skin involvement and investigates whether there is any relationship between median survival time (MST) and histological patterns, primary cutaneous involvement and CD8 positivity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All cases were HTLV-I+ and HIV- and were clinically classified. HTLV-I proviral integration was investigated in atypical cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed using CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD20, CD25, CD30 and CD45RO markers. Ki-67 was used to evaluate the proliferative index. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cases were primary, while 25 were secondary. Monoclonal viral integration was demonstrated in all atypical cases. Patterns resembling mycosis fungoides (MF) were found in 19 cases and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) in two cases. Fifteen cases had an atypical immunophenotype and expressed CD8. Primary cutaneous ATL had a longer MST (48 months) than the secondary cutaneous ATL (7 months) and the difference was statistically significant, but no statistically significant difference was found between the MST of CD8-positive and negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to differentiate between primary and secondary cutaneous ATL and classify the cases histologically in order to better evaluate the prognosis. The two forms of primary cutaneous ATL, primary cutaneous smoldering and primary cutaneous tumoral (PCT), should also be identified. The smoldering type presented a longer survival (58 months) and histological aspects suggestive of better prognosis in contrast to the PCT type that had a shorter survival (20 months) and histological characteristics suggestive of worse outcome.","['Bittencourt, Achilea L', 'Barbosa, Helenemarie S', 'Vieira, Maria Das Gracas', 'Farre, Lourdes']","['Bittencourt AL', 'Barbosa HS', 'Vieira MD', 'Farre L']","['Department of Pathology, Professor Edgard Santos Teaching Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil. achilea@uol.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/*mortality/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology/*mortality/pathology/virology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/05/13 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [medline]']","['908063411 [pii]', '10.1080/02841860802657235 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2009;48(4):598-604. doi: 10.1080/02841860802657235.,10.1080/02841860802657235 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, stem cell maintenance and differentiation during embryonic and adult development. After specific ligand binding, the intracellular part of the Notch receptor is cleaved off and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the transcription factor RBP-J. In the absence of activated Notch, RBP-J represses Notch target genes by recruiting a corepressor complex. Here, we review Notch signaling with a focus on gene regulatory events at Notch target genes. This is of utmost importance to understand Notch signaling since certain RBP-J associated cofactors and particular epigenetic marks determine the specificity of Notch target gene expression in different cell types.

OBJECTIVES: In this case-control study, we examined whether the use of paint and petroleum solvents at home before birth and in early childhood influenced the risk of leukemia in children.

We conducted further analyses by cytogenetic subtype. We used conditional logistic regression techniques to adjust for income. RESULTS: ALL risk was significantly associated with paint exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-2.15], with a higher risk observed when paint was used postnatally, by a person other than the mother, or frequently. The association was restricted to leukemia with translocations between chromosomes 12 and 21 (OR = 4.16; 95% CI, 1.66-10.4). We found no significant association between solvent use and ALL risk overall (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.51) or for various cytogenetic subtypes, but we observed a significant association in the 2.0- to 5.9-year age group (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25).

CONCLUSIONS: The association of ALL risk with paint exposure was strong, consistent with a causal relationship, but further studies are needed to confirm the association of ALL and AML risk with solvent exposure.","['Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Aldrich, Melinda C', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Month, Stacy', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Scelo G', 'Metayer C', 'Zhang L', 'Wiemels JL', 'Aldrich MC', 'Selvin S', 'Month S', 'Smith MT', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94704-7380, USA. scelo@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Petroleum)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Male', '*Paint', '*Petroleum', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced', 'Solvents/*toxicity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/03/07 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.11927 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2009 Jan;117(1):133-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.11927.

The disease is characterized by accumulation of clonal malignant B lymphocytes resistant to apoptosis. Strategies to hit the anti-apoptotic drift of the Bcl-2 family in B-CLL cells are being explored. A novel peptidomimetic based on the BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and recently shown to exert significant apoptotic activity on acute myeloid leukemia cells, both in vitro and in vivo, was assayed on ex-vivo derived leukemic cells from untreated B-CLL patients (n = 7). We found that this peptide, named 072RB, induced apoptosis of B-CLL samples at a concentration that does not affect viability of peripheral and bone marrow derived lymphocytes from healthy donors. Apoptosis was demonstrated by activation of Bak and Bax, externalization of plasma membranes phosphadydilserines, appearance of hypodiploid events in DNA flow cytometry histograms and was accompanied by dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Before the onset of marked apoptotic signs a progressive decline of the relevant anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 could be observed. The negative control peptide 072RBL94A was ineffective for B-CLL cells, supporting the sequence specificity of 072RB activity. No relationship was found between responsiveness to 072RB and Mcl-1/Bcl-X(L) basal levels or decrease magnitude, possibly because of the limited sample size of the study. Altogether, we demonstrate that 072RB induces significant apoptosis of B-CLL cells subsequent to Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 downregulation.","['Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Fais, Franco', 'Tenca, Claudya', 'Tomati, Valeria', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Casciaro, Salvatore', 'Mumot, Anna', 'Zoppoli, Gabriele', 'Ciccone, Ermanno', 'Parodi, Silvio', 'Bruno, Silvia']","['Ghiotto F', 'Fais F', 'Tenca C', 'Tomati V', 'Morabito F', 'Casciaro S', 'Mumot A', 'Zoppoli G', 'Ciccone E', 'Parodi S', 'Bruno S']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (072RB peptide)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis']",2009/01/24 09:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['7424 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.3.7424 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Feb;8(3):263-71. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.3.7424.

For example, mutations and translocations give rise to aberrant proteins such as Bcr-Abl where changes in protein conformation and dynamics are believed to result in deregulated kinase activity that provides the oncogenic signal in chronic myelogeous leukemia. Although crystal structures of the down-regulated c-Abl kinase core have been reported, the conformational impact of mutations that render Abl resistant to small-molecule kinase inhibitors are largely unknown as is the allosteric interplay of the various regulatory elements of the protein. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX MS) was used to compare the conformations of wild-type Abl with a nonmyristoylated form and with 3 clinically relevant imatinib resistance mutants (T315I, Y253H and E255V). A HX-resistant core localized to the interface between the SH2 and kinase domains, a region known to be important for maintaining the down-regulated state. Conformational differences upon demyristoylation were consistent with the SH2 domain moving to the top of the small lobe of the kinase domain as a function of activation. There were conformational changes in the T315I mutant but, surprisingly, no major changes in conformation were detected in either the Y253H or the E255V mutants. Taken together, these results provide evidence that allosteric interactions and conformational changes play a major role in Abl kinase regulation in solution. Similar analyses could be performed on any protein to provide mechanistic details about conformational changes and protein function.","['Iacob, Roxana E', 'Pene-Dumitrescu, Teodora', 'Zhang, Jianming', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Smithgall, Thomas E', 'Engen, John R']","['Iacob RE', 'Pene-Dumitrescu T', 'Zhang J', 'Gray NS', 'Smithgall TE', 'Engen JR']","['The Barnett Institute and Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Hydrogen/chemistry', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Models, Molecular', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]']","['0811912106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0811912106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Feb 3;106(5):1386-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0811912106.

A strategy to enhance the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy is the prior application of unlabeled antibody, resulting in an increase in the dose to the target tissue and a decrease in the burden to other organs. It was suggested that optimizing this approach might considerably improve radioimmunotherapy with anti-CD45 antibody. The present work develops a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to individually determine the optimal preload for radioimmunotherapy with the YAML568 anti-CD45 antibody for each patient. METHODS: A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe the biodistribution of anti-CD45 antibody. The transport of antibody to the organs of interest via blood flow, competitive binding of unlabeled and labeled antibody, degradation and excretion of antibody, and physical decay were included in the model. The model was fitted to the biokinetics data of 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. On the basis of the estimated parameters, simulations for a 0- to 534-nmol preload of unlabeled antibody were conducted and the organ residence times were calculated. RESULTS: The measured data could be adequately described by the constructed model. The estimated numbers of accessible antigens in the respective organ, in nanomoles, were 97+/-33 for red marrow, 49+/-24 for liver, 34+/-18 for spleen, 38+/-31 for lymph nodes, and 0.9+/-0.4 for blood. These ranges indicate high interpatient variability. The optimal amount of unlabeled antibody identified by simulations would improve the ratio of residence time in red marrow to residence time in liver by a factor of 1.6-2.4. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD45 antibody can be considerably increased with the presented model. A more selective delivery of radioactivity to the target organ and a reduction in the toxicity to normal tissue are achieved by determining the optimal preload. Furthermore, the adverse effects of radioimmunotherapy might be drastically reduced while saving antibody expenses. The validation of the model is ongoing. The model is easily extendible and therefore most probably applicable to radioimmunotherapy of other hematologic malignancies, such as antibodies targeted to CD20, CD33, or CD66.","['Kletting, Peter', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Reske, Sven N', 'Glatting, Gerhard']","['Kletting P', 'Bunjes D', 'Reske SN', 'Glatting G']","['Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Innere Medizin III, Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (YAML568 monoclonal antibody)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]']","['jnumed.108.054189 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.108.054189 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2009 Feb;50(2):296-302. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.108.054189.

METHODS: We first examined ALL-derived cell lines for the presence of abnormal levels of two different histone modifications (trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 [K4H3me3] and dimethylation of H3 lysine 9 [K9H3me2]) in the 5'UTR regions around CpG islands of 78 miRNAs by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-ChIP analysis. Methylation status (methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and expression (quantitative PCR) of miRNAs showing a pattern of histone modifications linked to a closed chromatin structure were analyzed in a panel of six ALL cell lines and in 353 ALL patients. RESULTS: CpG islands around 13 miRNAs disclosed high levels of K9H3me2 and/or low levels of K4H3me3, a pattern of histone modifications underlying a closed chromatin structure associated with repressive gene expression. Complete consistency in the correlation between both histone marks, the presence of DNA methylation around these miRNAs, and their expression patterns was confirmed in the six ALL cell lines. Treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine upregulated the expression levels of these genes, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms deregulate the expression of these miRNAs. A total of 65% of the ALL samples had at least one miRNA methylated (methylated group). Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 14 years were 78% and 71% for nonmethylated patients and 24% and 28% for methylated patients (P = .00001 for both). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that methylation profile was an independent prognostic factor for predicting DFS (P = .0001) and OS (P = .0001). CONCLUSION: Aberrant miRNA methylation is a common phenomenon in ALL that affects the clinical outcome of these patients.","['Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Arqueros, Victor', 'Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia', 'Rodriguez-Otero, Paula', 'Martin-Subero, Inaki', 'Garate, Leire', 'Cordeu, Lucia', 'San Jose-Eneriz, Edurne', 'Martin, Vanesa', 'Castillejo, Juan Antonio', 'Bandres, Eva', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Prosper, Felipe']","['Roman-Gomez J', 'Agirre X', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Arqueros V', 'Vilas-Zornoza A', 'Rodriguez-Otero P', 'Martin-Subero I', 'Garate L', 'Cordeu L', 'San Jose-Eneriz E', 'Martin V', 'Castillejo JA', 'Bandres E', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Siebert R', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A', 'Prosper F']",['Hematology Department.

In several notable diseases such as leukemia and breast cancer, the results have been encouraging. In these datasets, many techniques work well when discriminating particular outcomes. However, these same methods, applied to other datasets, are unable to achieve similar levels of success. Given the small sample sizes common to these studies and the large dimensionality of the data, several key issues exist when attempting to construct reliable, reproducible gene signatures. The classifiers may not be sufficient to discriminate classes, or the data itself may not be sufficient to produce effective separation. In this paper, three simple measures of classification complexity are considered to explore a limit to the predictive accuracy that can be achieved in a dataset. Two independent gene expression datasets (lung and colorectal cancer) are considered, using three different outcomes on each dataset. Four different classifiers, using the t-test for feature selection, were tested on these datasets as a representative panel of classifiers. Our results indicate that Fisher's discriminant ratio provides a good measure of the complexity of the classification problem, with a high correlation between complexity and best classification accuracy across all problems (R(2)=0.78). Specifically, predicting gender is a low complexity problem as indicated both by the complexity measure and the classification results. More clinically-oriented endpoints are more complex and have lower classification accuracies. Therefore, classification complexity can be used to estimate maximum attainable accuracy for a problem reducing the need to evaluate many different classifiers.","['Kamath, Vidya', 'Yeatman, Timothy J', 'Eschrich, Steven A']","['Kamath V', 'Yeatman TJ', 'Eschrich SA']","['Biomedical Engineering program at the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.

Epidemiological studies of population exposed to ionizing radiation provide information of radio-induced effects. The radiation risk or radiological detriment has been estimated from a group of six exposed interventionist radiologists of the Hospital La Fe (Valencia, Spain). Dosimetry has been periodically registered from TLDs and wrist dosimeters (physical methods) and estimated through translocations in lymphocytes of peripheral blood (biological methods), by extrapolating the yield of translocations to their respective dose-effect curves. The probability of non-melanoma skin cancer and leukaemia (acute myelogenous, acute lymphocytic and chronic myelogenous leukaemia) incidence has been estimated through the software RADRISK. This software is based on a transport model from epidemiological studies of population exposed to external low-LET ionizing radiation [1]. Other non-solid carcinomas have not been considered due to their low statistical power, such as myeloid and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

This process is time consuming when performed manually, and demanding from a technical point of view. An automatic pairing algorithm would thus bring benefits, but it remains an open problem to date.In this paper a new strategy for automatic pairing of homologous chromosomes is proposed.

FLT3 TKIs that are in various phases of clinical trials are showing some initial promise. However, primary and secondary acquired resistance stands to severely compromise long-term and durable efficacy of these inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy.

Using this method, freshly isolated jejunocytes could be distinguished from simultaneously isolated colonocytes, as the jejunocytes specifically exhibited the small intestinal peptidase gene transcript, as well as an active alkaline phosphatase. The transformation of both types of cell suspension was performed by retroviral infection, using reproduction-defective viruses bearing the gene coding for the large T antigen of the leukaemia simian virus (SV40). The success of the transfection was demonstrated by (1) a significant increase in cell passage numbers (52-53 vs. 7 passages for non-transfected cells), (2) the detection of both the large T transcript and the large T antigen in transformed cells. Possible contamination and progressive substitution of bovine primocultures by non-bovine lineages available in the laboratory was excluded, as the transformed cells presented a bovine typical karyotype. Most transfected cells kept an epithelial morphology after transformation. They also maintained the expression of FABP and enterocyte specific enzymes (brush-border associated maltase and IAP). However, levels of specific activity of these enzymes were low, suggesting that cell differentiation is not completely achieved under the applied culture conditions.","['Loret, Suzanne', 'Rusu, Dorina', 'El Moualij, Benaissa', 'Taminiau, Bernard', 'Heinen, Ernst', 'Dandrifosse, Guy', 'Mainil, Jacques']","['Loret S', 'Rusu D', 'El Moualij B', 'Taminiau B', 'Heinen E', 'Dandrifosse G', 'Mainil J']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and General Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Liege, Campus du Sart Tilman, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Res Vet Sci,Research in veterinary science,0401300,,IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Cattle', 'Cell Culture Techniques/veterinary', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colon/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Jejunum/*cytology', 'Staining and Labeling']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/09/05 06:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-5288(08)00245-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Res Vet Sci. 2009 Aug;87(1):123-32. doi: 10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.12.002.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Our study has adopted a systematic and bioassay-guided approach to optimize the extraction of Agaricus blazei for anti-leukemic bioactive components. The tumor-selective growth inhibitory activity of the extracts on leukemic cell lines was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using tumor-bearing nude mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Agaricus blazei extracts were prepared using different methods. MTT and tritiated thymidine incorporation assays were used to evaluate the in vitro anti-leukemic effects. The most potent extract was further investigated using NB-4 cells-bearing nude mice and mechanistic studies using DNA fragmentation assay and cell death detection ELISA. RESULTS: The JAB80E70 extract showed the most potent tumor-selective growth inhibitory activity against human leukemia NB-4 and K-562 cells. This is the first report of anti-leukemic activity of JAB80E70 in athymic nude mice bearing NB-4 cells. Using DNA fragmentation assays and cell death detection ELISA, JAB80E70 was found to induce apoptosis in NB-4 cells. However, the polysaccharide enriched fractions failed to show significant cytotoxicity on NB-4 cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The JAB80E70 extract exhibited potent anti-leukemic effect in vitro and in vivo. The effect can be attributed, at least in part, to the induction of apoptosis. Besides, polysaccharides in Agaricus blazei may not possess direct anti-leukemic activity in vitro.","['Kim, Chi-Fai', 'Jiang, Jing-Jing', 'Leung, Kwok-Nam', 'Fung, Kwok-Pui', 'Lau, Clara Bik-San']","['Kim CF', 'Jiang JJ', 'Leung KN', 'Fung KP', 'Lau CB']","['School of Pharmacy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",IM,"['*Agaricus', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Liver/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Polysaccharides/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(08)00723-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2008.12.025 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2009 Mar 18;122(2):320-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2008.12.025.

Other studies have demonstrated the oxidative activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) procarcinogens by AKR1C3 in cell-free systems. This is the first study that addresses whether AKR1C3 mediates carcinogen activation within intact living cells following manipulation of AKR1C3 by molecular intervention. Quantitative RT-PCR identified AKR1C3 as the predominant AKR1C isoform expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Exposure of K562 and KG1a myeloid cell lines to the known AKR1C3 substrate 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-3,4-dihydrodiol (7,12-DMBA-3,4-diol) resulted in both single strand DNA breaks and oxidative DNA damage as measured using conventional and FPG-modified comet assays respectively. PGD2-keto reductase activity was shown to be correlated with relative AKR1C3 expression and together with quantitative real time PCR was used to validate the RNAi-knockdown of AKR1C3 in K562 cells. Knockdown of AKR1C3 did not alter single strand DNA breaks following 7,12-DMBA-3,4-diol exposure but significantly decreased oxidative DNA damage. A similar interrelationship between AKR1C3 activity and 7,12-DMBA-3,4-diol mediated oxidative DNA damage but not single strand breaks was observed in KG1a cells.

Here we report that mir-9a belonging to the mir-9 family, regulates Drosophila wing development through a functional target site in the 3' untranslated region of the Drosophila LIM only protein, dLMO. dLMO is a transcription cofactor, that directly inhibits the activity of Apterous, the LIM-HD factor required for the proper dorsal identity of the wings. Deletions of the 3' untranslated region, including the mir-9a site, generate gain-of-function dLMO mutants (Beadex) associated with high levels of dLMO mRNA and protein. Beadex mutants lack wing margins, a phenotype also observed in null mir-9a mutants. We found that mir-9a and dLMO are co-expressed in wing discs and interact genetically for controlling wing development. Lack of mir-9a results in overexpression of dLMO, while gain-of-function mir-9a mutant suppresses dLMO expression. These data indicate that a function of mir-9a is to ensure the appropriate stoichiometry of dLMO during Drosophila wing development. The mir-9a binding site is conserved in the human counterpart LMO2, the T-cell acute leukemia oncogene, suggesting that mir-9 might apply a similar strategy to maintain LMO2 expression under a detrimental threshold.","['Biryukova, Inna', 'Asmar, Joelle', 'Abdesselem, Houari', 'Heitzler, Pascal']","['Biryukova I', 'Asmar J', 'Abdesselem H', 'Heitzler P']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Bx protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drosophila melanogaster/anatomy & histology/genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Wings, Animal/cytology/physiology']",2009/01/24 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2009/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0012-1606(08)01464-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.12.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2009 Mar 15;327(2):487-96. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.12.036.

Kaempferol has been shown to posses anticancer properties through the induction of the apoptotic program. Here we report that treatment of the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and promyelocitic human leukemia U937 with 50 microM kaempferol resulted in an increase of the antioxidant enzymes Mn and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). Kaempferol treatment induced apoptosis by decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 and increasing the expressions of Bax. There were also induction of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into cytosol and significant activation of caspase-3, and -9 with PARP cleavage. Kaempferol treatment increased the expression and the mitochondria localization of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3. K562 cells stably overexpressing SIRT3 were more sensitive to kaempferol, whereas SIRT3 silencing did not increase the resistance of K562 cells to kaempferol. Inhibition of PI3K and de-phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308 was also observed after treating both K562 and U937 cells with kaempferol. In conclusion our study shows that the oxidative stress induced by kaempferol in K562 and U937 cell lines causes the inactivation of Akt and the activation of the mitochondrial phase of the apoptotic program with an increase of Bax and SIRT3, decrease of Bcl-2, release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation, and cell death.","['Marfe, Gabriella', 'Tafani, Marco', 'Indelicato, Manuela', 'Sinibaldi-Salimei, Paola', 'Reali, Valentina', 'Pucci, Bruna', 'Fini, Massimo', 'Russo, Matteo Antonio']","['Marfe G', 'Tafani M', 'Indelicato M', 'Sinibaldi-Salimei P', 'Reali V', 'Pucci B', 'Fini M', 'Russo MA']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kaempferols/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sirtuin 3', 'Sirtuins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/*metabolism']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/06/11 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22044 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Mar 1;106(4):643-50. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22044.,10.1002/jcb.22044 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant transduction of Notch signaling contributes to many diseases and cancers in humans. The Notch receptor intracellular domain, the activated form of Notch receptor, is extremely difficult to detect in normal cells. However, it can activate signaling at very low protein concentration to elicit its biological effects. In the present study, a cell based luciferase reporter gene assay was established in K562 cells to screen drugs which could modulate the endogenous CBF1-dependent Notch signal pathway. Using this system, we found that the luciferase activity of CBF1-dependent reporter gene was activated by baicalin and baicalein but suppressed by niclosamide in both dose- and time-dependent manners. Treatment with these drugs modulated endogenous Notch signaling and affected mRNA expression levels of Notch1 receptor and Notch target genes in K562 cells. Additionally, erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was suppressed by baicalin and baicalein yet was promoted by niclosamide. Colony-forming ability in soft agar was decreased after treatment with baicalin and baicalein, but was not affected in the presence of niclosamide. Thus, modulation of Notch signaling after treatment with any of these three drugs may affect tumorigenesis of K562 cells suggesting that these drugs may have therapeutic potential for those tumors associated with Notch signaling. Taken together, this system could be beneficial for screening of drugs with potential to treat Notch signal pathway-associated diseases.","['Wang, An-Ming', 'Ku, Hung-Hai', 'Liang, Yu-Chih', 'Chen, Yen-Chou', 'Hwu, Yuh-Ming', 'Yeh, Tien-Shun']","['Wang AM', 'Ku HH', 'Liang YC', 'Chen YC', 'Hwu YM', 'Yeh TS']","['Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antiparasitic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '347Q89U4M5 (baicalin)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', '8KK8CQ2K8G (Niclosamide)']",IM,"['Antiparasitic Agents', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Niclosamide/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/06/11 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22065 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Mar 1;106(4):682-92. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22065.,10.1002/jcb.22065 [doi],,,PMC7166476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A well-informed decision on the use of anthracyclines in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer should be based on the available evidence on both antitumour efficacy and cardiotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: To compare antitumour efficacy of treatment including or not including anthracyclines in children with childhood cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2007). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment of any type of childhood cancer with and without anthracyclines and reporting outcomes concerning antitumour efficacy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, quality assessment and data-extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We identified RCTs for 5 types of tumour: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=3; 912 children), Wilms' tumour (n=1; 316 children), rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma (n=1; 413 children), Ewing's sarcoma (n=1; 94 children), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=1; 284 children). All studies had methodological limitations. For ALL no evidence of a significant difference in antitumour efficacy was identified in the meta-analyses, but in most individual studies there was a suggestion of better antitumour efficacy in patients treated with anthracyclines. For both Wilms' tumour and Ewing's sarcoma a significant difference in survival in favour of treatment with anthracyclines was identified. The hazard ratios for overall and event-free survival in Wilms' tumour were 1.85 (95% CI 1.09 to 3.15) and 2.21 (95% CI 1.44 to 3.40), respectively. For patients with Ewing's sarcoma only descriptive results were available (P = 0.02 for overall survival and P = 0.01 for event-free survival). For both rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma no difference in antitumour efficacy between the treatment groups was identified. Clinical cardiotoxicity was evaluated in 3 RCTs. No significant difference between both treatment groups was identified, but in all individual studies there was a suggestion of a lower rate of clinical cardiotoxicity in patients who did not receive anthracyclines. None of the studies evaluated asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. For other childhood cancers no RCTs were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At the moment no evidence from RCTs is available which underscores the use of anthracyclines in ALL. However, it should be noted that ""no evidence of effect"", as identified in this review, is not the same as ""evidence of no effect"". For Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma only 1 RCT was available and therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours. For other childhood cancers no RCTs were identified and therefore, no conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours. More high quality research is needed.","['van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Raphael, Martine F', 'Caron, Huib N', 'Kremer, Leontien Cm']","['van Dalen EC', 'Raphael MF', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']","[""Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital / Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660 (room F8-257), Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1100 DD. e.c.vandalen@amc.uva.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2009 Jan 21;(1):CD006647. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub2.,10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub2 [doi],20090121,,,,,,172,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(1):CD006647.

However, the molecular mechanisms of BM stromal cells (BMSCs)-mediated survival of tumor cell remain unclear. In this study, to further evaluate the role of Notch-1 in vivo microenvironment, we investigated the influence of inhibiting Notch-1 pathway by Notch-1 siRNA on Jurkat cells in the co-culture system. We found that Notch-1 signaling in Jurkat cells was further activated by interaction with BMSCs, which inhibited drug-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Notch-1 siRNA down-regulated Notch-1 and restored drug-induced apoptosis in co-cultured Jurkat cells. The possible mechanism of restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy could be associated with repressed Akt signaling. The results indicated that Notch-1 may be a potential mechanism of BMSCs involvement in the protection of hematopoietic malignant cells from drug-induced apoptosis.","['Guo, Dongmei', 'Ye, Jingjing', 'Li, Lizhen', 'Dai, Jianjian', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Guo D', 'Ye J', 'Li L', 'Dai J', 'Ma D', 'Ji C']","[""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['908025736 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802553257 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Feb;50(2):270-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190802553257.,10.1080/10428190802553257 [doi],,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Feb;50(2):158-9.

This study focused on these tumors and analyzed the association of gene expression profiles to clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten fresh samples of pleomorphic NOS sarcomas were evaluated histopathologically and by means of microarray analysis. Analysis of expression profiles was performed by clustering methods as well as by statistical analysis of primary vs recurrent tumors, irradiated vs nonirradiated tumors, tumors of patients above and below 60 years of age, male and female, and of tumors that developed metastatic or recurrent disease during the clinical course and those that did not. RESULTS: Tumor clustering did not correlate to any histopathological or clinical finding. Detailed gene expression analysis showed a variety of genes whose upregulation (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide, solute carrier family 39 member 14, solute carrier family 2 member 3, pleiotrophin, trophinin, pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 3, enolase 2, biglycan, SH3 and cysteine-rich domain, matrix metalloproteinases 16) and whose downregulation (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4, hairy/enhancer of split related with YRPW motif 2, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type Z polypeptide 1, SH3 domain GRB2-like 2, microtubule-associated protein 7, potassium voltage-gated channel shaker-related subfamily member 1, RUN and FYVE domain containing 3, Sin3A-associated protein 18 kDa, proline-rich 4, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to 3, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 9, NudC domain containing 3, imprinted in Prader-Willi syndrome, TAF6-like RNA polymerase II p300/CBP-associated factor 65 kDa, WD repeat and SOCS box-containing 2, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 3, KRR1, proliferation-associated 2G4; CD36, complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1, solute carrier family 4 sodium bicarbonate cotransporter member 4, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), GATA binding protein 3, LPL, glutathione peroxidase 3, D: -aspartate oxidase, apolipoprotein E, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3A) were associated with poor clinical outcome in terms of development of metastatic or recurrent disease.

Ionizing radiation (IR) is one of the most effective tools in the clinical treatment of cancer. The induction of apoptotic cell death is a significant mechanism of tumor cells under the influence of radio-/chemotherapy, and resistance to these treatments has been linked to some cancer cell lines with a low propensity for apoptosis. A combination of different anti-tumoral treatment modalities is advantageous in limiting non-specific toxicity often observed by an exceedingly high dose of single regimen. The present study aimed at investigating the enhanced effects and mechanisms in cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of U937 cells, a human pre-monocytic leukemia cell line lacking functional p53 protein, after combination treatment with irradiation and As(2)O(3). Our results indicated that combined treatment led to activation of cdc-2, which is related to the expression of cyclin B. In addition, combined treatment increased apoptotic cell death in U937 cells, which is correlated with the induction of mitotic arrest, the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the decrease in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma XL (Bcl-XL) levels, the loss of mitochondria membrane potential, and the activation of caspase-3.

METHODS: A 9-mer WT1 peptide (CMTWNQMNL) containing HLA-A * 0201-binding anchor motifs was synthesized. The suspended cells were collected from the culture of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and divided into 2 groups: Group D (pure T cells) and Group C (IL2 + T cells). The dendritic cells (DCs) generated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an HLA-A* 0201-positive healthy donor were repeatedly loaded with WT1 peptide so as to elicit cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) specifically for WT1 peptide, and restricted by HLA-A * 0201 (Group A). The specific lysis effects of WT1 peptide specific CTLs upon leukemic bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells positively expressing WT1 (3 being HLA-A * 0201(+) and 3 being HLA-A*0201(-)), peripheral blood CD34+ cells from healthy persons (2 being HLA-A * 0201(+) and 1 being HLA-A * 0201(-)), and leukemia cells of the lines of NB4 (HLA-A * 0201(+)/WT1(+)), U937 (HLA-A * 0201(+)/WT1(-)), and K562 (HLA-A * 0201(-)/WT1(+)) were measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) chromatometry assay. The colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) forming capability of the leukemic bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells and peripheral blood CD34+ cells from healthy persons treated with WT1 peptide specific CTLs were also determined by methylcellulose medium colony-forming unit assay. The CTLs elicited by DCs without WT1 peptide loading(Group B)and T cells cultured with IL-2 (Group C) were taken as controls. RESULTS: The CTLs specific for WT1 peptide and restricted by HLA-A * 0201 (Group A) exerted a specific lysis upon the 3 cases with HLA-A * 0201(+)/WT1(+) leukemic bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells and NB4 leukemia cells, the specific lysis levels were 55.3% +/- 2.8%, 67.1% +/- 3.2%, 49.4% +/- 3.8% and 55.0% +/- 3.7% respectively, all significantly higher than those upon the 3 cases with HLA-A * 0201(-)/WT1(+) leukemic bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells, normal healthy peripheral blood CD34+ cells of the healthy persons, and leukemia cell of the lines K562 and U937 (the specific lysis levels were all < 20%). The specific lysis level of Group A CTLs was significantly higher than those of Group B and Group C CTLs (both P < 0.01). The relative colony formation rates of WT1-CTLs in Group A upon the 2 cases with HLA-A * 0201(+)/WT1(+) leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells were 17.8% +/- 4.0% and 20.8% +/- 3.41% respectively, both significantly lower than those of the none WT1-CTLs in Group B (88.9% +/- 3.4% and 91.8% +/- 5.7% respectively, both P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the relative colony formation rate upon HLA-A * 0201(+)/WT1(-) leukemic bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells and the HLA-A * 0201(-)/WT1(-) or HLA-A * 0201(+)/WT1(-) normal peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells between the CTLs of Groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: The CTLs specific for WT1 and restricted by HLA-A * 0201 can exert specific lysis upon leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells highly expressing WT1 gene, and can inhibit the CFU-GM colony formation of such leukemic CD34+ progenitor cells. The product of expression of WT1 gene may be used as a target in the leukemic CD34+ cells.","['Gu, Wei-ying', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Qiu, Guo-qiang', 'Hu, Shao-yan', 'Jia, Li', 'Wu, Wei', 'He, Jun', 'Cen, Jian-nong', 'He, Bai']","['Gu WY', 'Chen ZX', 'Qiu GQ', 'Hu SY', 'Jia L', 'Wu W', 'He J', 'Cen JN', 'He B']","[""Department of Hematology, First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Third Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Changzhou 213003, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Dec 30;88(48):3401-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several lines of evidence indicate that Bach2 is a B-cell specific tumor suppressor. We here address patterns of insertional mutagenesis and expression of Bach2 is a murine retroviral model of B-cell lymphoma induction. RESULTS: We report that the Bach2 gene is a target of proviral integrations in B-cell lymphomas induced by murine leukemia virus. An alternative Bach2 promoter was identified within intron 2 and this promoter was activated in one of the tumors harboring proviral integration. The alternative promoter was active in both normal and tumor tissue and the tissue specificity of the two Bach2 promoters was similar. Three different alternatively used Bach2 terminal exons were identified to be located in intron 4. The inclusion of these exons resulted in the generation of Bach2 mRNA with open reading frames lacking the bZIP DNA binding domain present in the normal Bach2 protein, but retaining a partial BTB protein dimerization domain. Such Bach2 protein was excluded from the cell nucleus. CONCLUSION: We have identified an alternative promoter and new protein isoforms of Bach2. Our data imply that activation of an alternative promoter by proviral integration serves as a possible mechanism of up-regulation of the Bach2 gene with a potential role in B-cell lymphomagenesis. The finding of novel Bach2 transcripts and protein isoforms will facilitate a better insight into the normal and pathophysiological regulation of the Bach2 gene.","['Liu, Jinghua', 'Sorensen, Annette Balle', 'Wang, Bruce', 'Wabl, Matthias', 'Nielsen, Anders Lade', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Liu J', 'Sorensen AB', 'Wang B', 'Wabl M', 'Nielsen AL', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, C.F.

It selectively inhibits aberrantly activated tyrosine kinases in malignant cells, for example, bcr-abl in leukaemia, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit) in solid cancers including malignant glioma. However, recently published clinical studies with imatinib monotherapy in patients with malignant glioma demonstrated only very modest anti-tumour activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological activity of imatinib, its cellular mechanisms of action and its synergism with other chemotherapeutic agents in human malignant glioma cells in culture. Expression of PDGF/R and c-Kit was analyzed by RT-PCR. Proliferation was measured by MTT assays and drug synergy was assessed by the Chou-Talalay method. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry and migration by monolayer migration assays. Multi-immunoblot was performed on imatinib-treated and control malignant glioma cells. Results indicate that imatinib is more effective in inhibiting cell colony formation and migration rather than proliferation. Imatinib treatment caused cell cycle arrest of glioma cells in G0-G1 or G2/M, with significant elevation of a few cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, imatinib acted synergistically with chemotherapy agents, such as the DNA alkylating agent, temozolomide, and riboneucleotide reductase inhibitors, for example, hydroxyurea at varied effective dose levels. In conclusion, imatinib exerts varied biological effects on malignant glioma cells in culture. Synergistic interaction of imatinib with chemotherapy agents may be related to cell cycle control mechanisms and could be potentially important in a clinical setting.","['Ren, Huan', 'Tan, Xiaoqing', 'Dong, Yucui', 'Giese, Alf', 'Chou, Ting Chao', 'Rainov, Nikolai', 'Yang, Baofeng']","['Ren H', 'Tan X', 'Dong Y', 'Giese A', 'Chou TC', 'Rainov N', 'Yang B']","['Department of Immunology, Harbin Medical University, 150081 Harbin, China. huan_ren@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']","['PTO371 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-7843.2008.00371.x [doi]']",ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2009 Mar;104(3):241-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2008.00371.x.

Here we report the use of NMR metabolomic profiling to further study the effect of BEZ and MPA on three AML cell lines and to shed light on the underlying mechanism of action. For this we focused on drug effects induced during the initial 24 hours of treatment prior to the onset of overt cellular responses and examined these in the context of basal differences in metabolic profiles between the cell lines. Despite their ultimately profound cellular effects, the early changes in metabolic profiles engendered by these drugs were less pronounced than the constitutive metabolic differences between cell types. Nonetheless, drug treatments engendered common metabolic changes, most markedly in the response to the combination of BEZ and MPA. These responses included changes to TCA cycle intermediates consistent with recently identified chemical actions of ROS. Notable amongst these was the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate which was recapitulated by the treatment of cell extracts with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These findings indicate that the actions of combined BEZ and MPA against AML cells are indeed mediated downstream of the generation of ROS rather than some hitherto unsuspected mechanism. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that metabolite profiles represent highly sensitive markers for genomic differences between cells and their responses to external stimuli. This opens new perspectives to use metabolic profiling as a tool to study the rational redeployment of drugs in new disease settings.","['Tiziani, Stefano', 'Lodi, Alessia', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Viant, Mark R', 'Bunce, Christopher M', 'Gunther, Ulrich L']","['Tiziani S', 'Lodi A', 'Khanim FL', 'Viant MR', 'Bunce CM', 'Gunther UL']","['CR UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Henry Wellcome Building for Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy (HWB-NMR), Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Time Factors']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004251 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(1):e4251. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004251.

Furthermore, high expression of CDX2 was associated with inferior overall survival and showed up as a novel and strong risk factor for ALL in bivariate analysis. Functional analyses showed that overexpression of Cdx2 in murine bone marrow progenitors perturbed genes involved in lymphoid development and that depletion of CDX2 in the human ALL cell line Nalm6 inhibited colony formation.

To overcome resistance, second-generation inhibitors of BCR-ABL have been developed. Among these, nilotinib is more potent against BCR-ABL than imatinib, and is effective against many imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. In this study, an in vitro flow cytometry assay to analyze imatinib- and nilotinib-induced apoptosis in CML cells has been developed. Both the drugs induced significant apoptosis in CD34+ cells from 36 CML bone marrow samples (P<10(-4)), whereas CD34+ cells from BCR-ABL negative samples were unaffected. When the experiments were carried out in the presence of a cocktail of cytokines, nilotinib- but not imatinib-induced apoptosis was inhibited. This differential inhibition was confirmed on K562 cells. A blocking anti-CD117 antibody alleviated the antiapoptotic effect of cytokines against nilotinib. Moreover, using short hairpin RNA against BCR-ABL, we showed that K562 cells were not dependent on BCR-ABL signaling as long as the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor pathway was activated. We conclude that the c-KIT pathway may substitute for BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase to activate survival signals, and that c-KIT must be inhibited besides Bcr-Abl to allow apoptosis of CML cells.","['Belloc, F', 'Airiau, K', 'Jeanneteau, M', 'Garcia, M', 'Guerin, E', 'Lippert, E', 'Moreau-Gaudry, F', 'Mahon, F-X']","['Belloc F', 'Airiau K', 'Jeanneteau M', 'Garcia M', 'Guerin E', 'Lippert E', 'Moreau-Gaudry F', 'Mahon FX']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cibles Therapeutiques, INSERM U876, Universite Victor Segalen, Bordeaux Cedex, France. francis.belloc@chu-bordeaux.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008364 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.364 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):679-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.364.

Tumour cells from HDN are leukaemic counterparts of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Despite increased knowledge of the ontogenetic origin of these tumours, the genetic causes and oncogenic signalling events involved in malignant transformation are still unknown. To delineate novel candidate regions and disease-related genes, we studied nine typical CD4+CD56+ HDN cases using genome-wide high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Genomic imbalances, which were predominantly losses, were frequently detected. Gross genomic losses or gains involving an entire chromosome were observed in eight cases. The most frequent imbalances were deletions of chromosome 9, chromosome 13 and partial losses affecting 17p or 12p. Combinations of deletions of tumour suppressor genes (TSG), namely RB1, CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2A, (p16(ink4a), p14(arf)) or TP53 (p53), were observed in all cases. These results indicate that deletion events altering G1/S regulation are crucial for HDN oncogenesis. Furthermore, in addition to frequent sporadic gene losses, in one case we observed a 8q24 interstitial deletion that brought MYC closer to miR-30b/miR-30d, which may be related to their deregulation. Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to frequent G1/S checkpoint alterations, various genetic events could contribute to the chemoresistance of the tumour.","['Jardin, F', 'Callanan, M', 'Penther, D', 'Ruminy, P', 'Troussard, X', 'Kerckaert, J P', 'Figeac, M', 'Parmentier, F', 'Rainville, V', 'Vaida, I', 'Bertrand, P', 'Duval, A B', 'Picquenot, J M', 'Chaperot, L', 'Marolleau, J P', 'Plumas, J', 'Tilly, H', 'Bastard, C']","['Jardin F', 'Callanan M', 'Penther D', 'Ruminy P', 'Troussard X', 'Kerckaert JP', 'Figeac M', 'Parmentier F', 'Rainville V', 'Vaida I', 'Bertrand P', 'Duval AB', 'Picquenot JM', 'Chaperot L', 'Marolleau JP', 'Plumas J', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C']","['INSERM, U918, European Institute of Peptide Research (IFR23), Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France. fabrice.jardin@rouen.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*CD4 Antigens', '*CD56 Antigen', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'S Phase/genetics']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008359 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.359 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):698-707. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.359.

Specifically, proportions and absolute cell counts of common myeloid progenitors (CMP) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP) are significantly greater in comparison to normal bone marrow whereas absolute numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are equal. To understand the basis for this, we performed gene expression profiling (Affymetrix HU-133A 2.0) of the distinct CD34+ cell subsets from six patients with CP CML and five healthy donors. Euclidean distance analysis revealed a remarkable transcriptional similarity between the CML patients' HSC and normal progenitors, especially CMP. CP CML HSC were transcriptionally more similar to their progeny than normal HSC to theirs, suggesting a more mature phenotype. Hence, the greatest differences between CP CML patients and normal donors were apparent in HSC including downregulation of genes encoding adhesion molecules, transcription factors, regulators of stem-cell fate and inhibitors of cell proliferation in CP CML. Impaired adhesive and migratory capacities were functionally corroborated by fibronectin detachment analysis and transwell assays, respectively. Based on our findings we propose a loss of quiescence of the CML HSC on detachment from the niche leading to expansion of myeloid progenitors.","['Bruns, I', 'Czibere, A', 'Fischer, J C', 'Roels, F', 'Cadeddu, R-P', 'Buest, S', 'Bruennert, D', 'Huenerlituerkoglu, A N', 'Stoecklein, N H', 'Singh, R', 'Zerbini, L F', 'Jager, M', 'Kobbe, G', 'Gattermann, N', 'Kronenwett, R', 'Brors, B', 'Haas, R']","['Bruns I', 'Czibere A', 'Fischer JC', 'Roels F', 'Cadeddu RP', 'Buest S', 'Bruennert D', 'Huenerlituerkoglu AN', 'Stoecklein NH', 'Singh R', 'Zerbini LF', 'Jager M', 'Kobbe G', 'Gattermann N', 'Kronenwett R', 'Brors B', 'Haas R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany. ingmar.bruns@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008392 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.392 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):892-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.392.

As full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation on both threonine 308 (Thr308) and serine 473 (Ser473) residues, we studied the level of phosphorylation on the both sites in 58 AML samples by flow cytometry. The ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity of Thr308 and Ser473 represented a continuum ranging from 0.3 to 5.6 and from 0.4 to 2.87, respectively. There were no significant correlations between age, gender, French-American-British classification, leukocytosis, FLT3-ITD and Akt phosphorylation. However, the level of phosphorylation on Thr308, but not on Ser473, was significantly correlated with high-risk karyotype. Thr308(high) patients had significantly shorter overall survival (11 vs 47 months; P=0.01), event-free survival (9 vs 26 months; P=0.005) and relapse-free survival (10 months vs not reached; P=0.02) than Thr308(low) patients. Neither screening for AKT1 E17K mutation nor changes in the level of PTEN expression and phosphorylation could be linked to increased phosphorylation on Thr308 in high-risk cytogenetic AML cells. However, PP2A activity was significantly reduced in high-risk samples compared with intermediate-risk samples. Moreover, the specific Akt inhibitor, Akti-1/2, inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenic properties, and induced apoptosis in AML cells with high-risk cytogenetics, suggesting that Akt may represent a therapeutic target in high-risk AML.","['Gallay, N', 'Dos Santos, C', 'Cuzin, L', 'Bousquet, M', 'Simmonet Gouy, V', 'Chaussade, C', 'Attal, M', 'Payrastre, B', 'Demur, C', 'Recher, C']","['Gallay N', 'Dos Santos C', 'Cuzin L', 'Bousquet M', 'Simmonet Gouy V', 'Chaussade C', 'Attal M', 'Payrastre B', 'Demur C', 'Recher C']","[""Inserm, U563, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Departement d'Oncogenese, Signalisation et Innovation Therapeutique, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2CA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Risk Assessment', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008395 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.395 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1029-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.395.

Although quantitative detection of clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements is currently considered to be the standard method, leukaemia fusion genes provide other possible targets for MRD follow-up, as already demonstrated in TEL/AML1-positive ALLs. We analysed and compared MRD levels quantified by BCR/ABL transcript detection and by the standard Ig/TCR-based method in 218 bone marrow specimens from 17 children with BCR/ABL-positive ALL. We found only a limited overall correlation of MRD levels as assessed by the two methods (correlation coefficient R(2)=0.64). The correlation varied among patients from excellent (R(2)=0.99) to very poor (R(2)=0.17). Despite identical sensitivity of the approaches, 20% of the samples were negative by the Ig/TCR approach whereas positive by the BCR/ABL method. We show that multilineage involvement is at least partly responsible for the discrepancy. Moreover, our data demonstrate that BCR/ABL monitoring enables better and earlier prediction of relapse compared to the standard Ig/TCR methodology. We conclude that BCR/ABL-based MRD monitoring of childhood ALL is a clinically relevant tool and should be performed in parallel with the standard Ig/TCR follow-up.","['Zaliova, M', 'Fronkova, E', 'Krejcikova, K', 'Muzikova, K', 'Mejstrikova, E', 'Stary, J', 'Trka, J', 'Zuna, J']","['Zaliova M', 'Fronkova E', 'Krejcikova K', 'Muzikova K', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Stary J', 'Trka J', 'Zuna J']","['CLIP, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008386 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.386 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):944-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.386.

PTEN is deficient in many cancer cells, including Jurkat human leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that the status of PTEN determines cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress through antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-mediated transcription of detoxification genes. We found that ferritin H transcription was robustly induced in tert-butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ)-treated Jurkat cells via an ARE, and it was due to PTEN deficiency. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferases and Nrf2 recruitment to the ARE and Bach1 release were blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, along with the partial inhibition of Nrf2 nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, acetylations of histone H3 Lys9 and Lys18, and deacetylation of Lys14 were associated with the PI3K-dependent ARE activation. Consistently, PTEN restoration in Jurkat cells inhibited t-BHQ-mediated expression of ferritin H and another ARE-regulated gene NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1. Conversely, PTEN knockdown in K562 cells enhanced the response to t-BHQ. The PTEN status under t-BHQ treatment affected hydrogen peroxide-mediated caspase-3 cleavage. The PI3K-dependent ferritin H induction was observed by treatment with other ARE-activating agents ethoxyquin and hemin. Collectively, the status of PTEN determines chromatin modifications leading to ARE activation.","['Sakamoto, Kensuke', 'Iwasaki, Kenta', 'Sugiyama, Hiroyuki', 'Tsuji, Yoshiaki']","['Sakamoto K', 'Iwasaki K', 'Sugiyama H', 'Tsuji Y']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'C12674942B (2-tert-butylhydroquinone)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ferritins/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Response Elements/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']","['E08-07-0762 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e08-07-0762 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2009 Mar;20(6):1606-17. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e08-07-0762.

In contrast, microarray studies in human renal transplant implantation biopsies indicate a strong acute phase response in the deceased donor kidney, associated with a significant upregulation of oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMR). The aim of this study was to determine whether the kidney can generate a strong acute phase response, mediated by the OSM/OSMR gateway. Genes associated with the IL-6 cytokine family and acute phase reactants were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in four groups of human biopsies spanning a spectrum of renal injury. OSM, OSMR, and fibrinogen beta (FGB) were progressively more highly expressed from prenephrectomy, living donor, deceased donor, to discarded donor kidneys, suggesting correlation with severity of injury and local renal synthesis. Acute phase response gene expression was analyzed in human proximal tubular cells in culture in response to OSM. OSM induced a significant increase in expression of FGB, OSMR, serpin peptidase inhibitor A1, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and a decrease in IL-6R. These changes were largely attenuated by coincubation with an OSMR blocking antibody, indicating the OSM effect was mediated through OSMR. OSM also resulted in a significantly altered expression of acute phase genes compared with IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor, suggesting that OSM is the predominant cytokine mediating the renal tubular acute phase response. In conclusion, the renal parenchyma is capable of generating a strong acute phase response, likely mediated via OSM/OSMR.","['Luyckx, Valerie A', 'Cairo, Lucas V', 'Compston, Catharine A', 'Phan, Wai Lee', 'Mueller, Thomas F']","['Luyckx VA', 'Cairo LV', 'Compston CA', 'Phan WL', 'Mueller TF']","['HMRC 260, Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada T6G 2S2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

This study investigates whether there is any relationship between Bcr-Abl expression and proteasome activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorogenic substrate assays and an activity-based probe were used to profile proteasome activity in CML cell-line models and the effect of the proteasome inhibitor BzLLLCOCHO on these cell-line models and primary CML cells was investigated. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that oncogenic transformation by BCR-ABL is associated with an increase in proteasome proteolytic activity. Furthermore, small interfering RNA targeted against BCR-ABL reduces proteasome activity. In addition, we have found that Bcr-Abl-positive cells are more sensitive than Bcr-Abl-negative cells to induction of apoptosis by the proteasome inhibitor BzLLLCOCHO, and that sequential addition of imatinib followed by BzLLLCOCHO has an additive effect on the induction of apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Finally, we demonstrate that cell lines that become resistant to imatinib remain sensitive to proteasome inhibition. CONCLUSION: This is the first time that a direct relationship has been demonstrated between BCR-ABL transformation and the enzymatic activity of the proteasome. Our results suggest that the proteasome might provide a useful therapeutic target in CML, particularly in those patients who have developed resistance to conventional treatment.","['Crawford, Lisa J', 'Windrum, Phlip', 'Magill, Laura', 'Melo, Junia V', 'McCallum, Lynn', 'McMullin, Mary F', 'Ovaa, Huib', 'Walker, Brian', 'Irvine, Alexandra E']","['Crawford LJ', 'Windrum P', 'Magill L', 'Melo JV', 'McCallum L', 'McMullin MF', 'Ovaa H', 'Walker B', 'Irvine AE']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00522-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Mar;37(3):357-66. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.11.004.

In general, HOX expression tends to be higher in more primitive and lower in lineage-committed cells. These trends have led to the hypothesis that self-renewal of hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells is HOX-dependent and that dysregulated HOX expression underlies maintenance of the leukemia-initiating cell. Gene expression profile studies support this hypothesis and specifically highlight the importance of the HOXA cluster in hemopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Within this cluster HOXA6 and HOXA9 are highly expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and form part of the ""Hox code"" identified in murine models of this disease. We have examined endogenous expression of Hoxa6 and Hoxa9 in purified primary progenitors as well as four growth factor-dependent cell lines FDCP-Mix, EML, 32Dcl3, and Ba/F3, representative of early multipotential and later committed precursor cells respectively. Hoxa6 was consistently higher expressed than Hoxa9, preferentially expressed in primitive cells and was both growth-factor and cell-cycle regulated. Enforced overexpression of HOXA6 or HOXA9 in FDCP-Mix resulted in increased proliferation and colony formation but had negligible effect on differentiation. In both FDCP-Mix and the more committed Ba/F3 precursor cells overexpression of HOXA6 potentiated factor-independent proliferation. These findings demonstrate that Hoxa6 is directly involved in fundamental processes of hemopoietic progenitor cell development.","['Dickson, Glenda J', 'Kwasniewska, Alexandra', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Lappin, Terence R J', 'Thompson, Alexander']","['Dickson GJ', 'Kwasniewska A', 'Mills KI', 'Lappin TR', 'Thompson A']","[""Haematology, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK. glenda.dickson@qub.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa6 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2009/01/23 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00508-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Mar;37(3):322-33.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.015.

METHODS: Subjects were children enrolled in Children's Cancer Group 2891 with AML. In phase 1 (induction), patients were randomized to intensive or standard timing. In phase 2 (consolidation), those with a family donor were allocated allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT); the remainder were randomized to autologous SCT or chemotherapy. This report compares infections between different treatments on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: During phase 1, intensive timing was associated with more bacterial (57.7% vs 39.4%; P < .001), fungal (27.4% vs 9.9%; P < .001), and viral (14.0% vs 3.9%; P < .001) infections compared with standard timing. During phase 2, chemotherapy was associated with more bacterial (56.5% vs 40.1%; P = .005), but similar fungal (9.5% vs 6.1%; P = 1.000) and viral (4.2% vs 12.9%; P = .728) infections compared with allogeneic SCT. No differences between chemotherapy and autologous SCT infections were seen. Fatal infections were more common during intensive compared with standard timing induction (5.5% vs 0.9%; P = .004). Infectious deaths were similar between chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and allogeneic SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of infection varies depending on the intensity and type of treatment. This information sheds insight into the mechanisms behind susceptibility and outcome of infections in pediatric AML.","['Sung, Lillian', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Buxton, Allen', 'Britton, Kristen', 'Deswarte-Wallace, Joetta', 'Woods, William G']","['Sung L', 'Gamis A', 'Alonzo TA', 'Buxton A', 'Britton K', 'Deswarte-Wallace J', 'Woods WG']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

RESULTS: Twenty-six patients achieved second complete remission; 9 achieved partial remission. Of 13 patients who showed progression despite first and second line therapy, only one patient was alive on the second relapse after unrelated cord blood transplantation. Among 40 relapsed patients, the median time between initial diagnosis and relapse was 12.5 months (range 3-56 months). The sites of relapse were isolated BM (n = 9), primary local site with BM (9), primary local site (6), isolated CNS (4), local site with mediastinum (4), primary local site with other site (4), and others (4). Of all 48 patients, 3 were alive after chemotherapy alone. Of the 33 patients, 14 were alive after high dose chemotherapy (HDC)/SCT. With a 27.5-month median follow up period, the 3-year OS rate was 43.2 +/- 7.4% (estimate +/- SE). Univariate analysis identified two features (relapse within 12 months, T cell phenotype) as significant variables that predicted poor survival. Multivariate analysis showed novel statistically significant variables including relapse within 12 months from initial diagnosis (Hazard ratio 3.60) and absence of HDC/SCT (2.64). CONCLUSION: Outcomes of patients with relapsed/primary refractory LBL were poor, but HDC/SCT for these patients was associated with good results.","['Mitsui, Tetsuo', 'Mori, Tetsuya', 'Fujita, Naoto', 'Inada, Hiroko', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito']","['Mitsui T', 'Mori T', 'Fujita N', 'Inada H', 'Horibe K', 'Tsurusawa M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamagata University Hospital, Yamagata, Japan. tmitsui@med.id.yamagata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21941 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 May;52(5):591-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21941.,10.1002/pbc.21941 [doi],,,,,,,,,,"['Lymphoma Committee, Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group']",,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

MSC are cells with the morphological features of fibroblasts, which, in addition to their nursing function for hematopoietic stem cells, retain the ability to differentiate into cartilage, bone, fat, muscle, and tendon and have an important immunmodulatory function. To understand in more detail hematopoietic engraftment and immune modulation after hematopoietic cell transplantation, we investigated the ability of donor MSC to engraft after hematopoietic cell transplantation in dependency to the conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs. reduced intensity) and source of the graft (bone marrow vs. peripheral blood). METHODS: Bone marrow MSC of 12 patients were analyzed, a median of 23.4 (range 0.9-137.8) months after human leukocyte antigen matched but gender mismatched bone marrow transplantation after myeloablative conditioning (n=4) or peripheral blood cell transplantation after myeloablative (n=4) or reduced intensity conditioning (n=4). MSC were characterized by morphology, positivity for CD 105+, CD73+, CD 44+, and CD 90+, and by their capacity to differentiate into adipocytic and osteogenic cells. Recipient and donor origins were determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization for sex chromosomes. RESULTS: While overall blood and bone marrow chimerism was 100% donor type, MSC remained in all patients of recipient origin (>96%). There was no difference between patients receiving bone marrow and peripheral blood grafts, nor was any difference observed between patients receiving full intensity in comparison with reduced intensity conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MSC remain of host type irrespective of the conditioning regimen and graft source.","['Bartsch, Kristina', 'Al-Ali, Haifa', 'Reinhardt, Annette', 'Franke, Christina', 'Hudecek, Michael', 'Kamprad, Manja', 'Tschiedel, Sabine', 'Cross, Michael', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Gentilini, Chiara']","['Bartsch K', 'Al-Ali H', 'Reinhardt A', 'Franke C', 'Hudecek M', 'Kamprad M', 'Tschiedel S', 'Cross M', 'Niederwieser D', 'Gentilini C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.

Differences in self-reactivity between human naive and IgM(+) memory B cells may reflect distinct mechanisms by which BCR signaling dictates their survival and death. Here we demonstrate that BCR stimulation protected naive B cells from apoptosis with induction of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, whereas it rather accelerated apoptosis of IgM(+) memory B cells by inducing proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. We found that BCR-mediated PI3K activation induced the expression of Mcl-1, whereas it inhibited Bim expression in B cells. Phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream molecule of PI3K, was more sustained in naive than IgM(+) memory B cells. Abundant expression of T cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (Tcl1), an Akt coactivator, was found in naive B cells, and enforced expression of Tcl1 induced a high level of Mcl-1 expression, resulting in prolonged B cell survival. In contrast, Galectin-1 (Gal-1) was abundantly expressed in IgM(+) memory B cells, and inhibited Akt phosphorylation, leading to Bim up-regulation. Enforced expression of Gal-1 induced accelerated apoptosis in B cells. These results suggest that a unique set of molecules, Tcl1 and Gal-1, defines distinct BCR signaling cascades, dictating survival and death of human naive and IgM(+) memory B cells.","['Tabrizi, Siamak Jabbarzadeh', 'Niiro, Hiroaki', 'Masui, Mariko', 'Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Iino, Tadafumi', 'Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Wakasaki, Takahiro', 'Baba, Eishi', 'Shimoda, Shinji', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Hara, Toshiro', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Tabrizi SJ', 'Niiro H', 'Masui M', 'Yoshimoto G', 'Iino T', 'Kikushige Y', 'Wakasaki T', 'Baba E', 'Shimoda S', 'Miyamoto T', 'Hara T', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Galectin 1/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism/physiology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['182/3/1490 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.182.3.1490 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Feb 1;182(3):1490-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.182.3.1490.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The retinoic acid receptor RARalpha and the acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-specific counterpart PML-RARalpha directly interact with Pin1. Overexpression of Pin1 inhibits ligand-dependent activation of RARalpha and PML-RARalpha. Inhibition is relieved by Pin1-targeted short interfering RNAs and by pharmacologic inhibition of the catalytic activity of the protein. Mutants of Pin1 catalytically inactive or defective for client-protein-binding activity are incapable of inhibiting ligand-dependent RARalpha transcriptional activity. Functional inhibition of RARalpha and PML-RARalpha by Pin1 correlates with degradation of the nuclear receptors via the proteasome-dependent pathway. In the acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines HL-60 and NB4, Pin1 interacts with RARalpha in a constitutive fashion. Suppression of Pin1 by a specific short hairpin RNA in HL-60 or NB4 cells stabilizes RARalpha and PML-RARalpha, resulting in increased sensitivity to the cytodifferentiating and antiproliferative activities of all-trans retinoic acid. Treatment of the two cell lines and freshly isolated acute myelogenous leukemia blasts (M1 to M4) with ATRA and a pharmacologic inhibitor of Pin1 causes similar effects.

However, GITR may mediate different effects in mice and men and impairs the reactivity of human natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we studied the role of GITR and its ligand (GITRL) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surface expression of GITRL was observed on AML cells in six of seven investigated cell lines, and 34 of 60 investigated AML patients whereas healthy CD34(+) cells did not express GITRL. Furthermore, soluble GITRL (sGITRL) was detectable in AML patient sera in 18 of 55 investigated cases. While the presence of GITRL was not restricted to a specific AML subtype, surface expression was significantly associated with monocytic differentiation. Signaling via GITRL into patient AML cells induced the release of TNF and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and this was blocked by the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, triggering GITR by surface-expressed and sGITRL impaired NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production in cocultures with leukemia cells, and NK cell reactivity could be restored by blocking GITR and neutralization of sGITRL and IL-10. Thus, whereas a stimulatory role of the GITR-GITRL system in mouse antitumor immunity has been reported, our data show that in humans GITRL expression subverts NK cell immunosurveillance of AML. Our results provide useful information for therapeutic approaches in AML, which, like haploidentical stem cell transplantation, rely on a sufficient NK cell response.","['Baessler, Tina', 'Krusch, Matthias', 'Schmiedel, Benjamin Joachim', 'Kloss, Mercedes', 'Baltz, Katrin Miriam', 'Wacker, Alexander', 'Schmetzer, Helga Maria', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer']","['Baessler T', 'Krusch M', 'Schmiedel BJ', 'Kloss M', 'Baltz KM', 'Wacker A', 'Schmetzer HM', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (TNFSF18 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2650 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2650 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;69(3):1037-45. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2650.

In this study, we first evaluated the expression of 308 miRNAs in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal hepatic tissues and identified 29 differentially expressed miRNAs in HCC tissues. miR-101, a significantly down-regulated miRNA, was further studied in greater detail because the signal pathway(s) regulated by miR-101 and the role of miR-101 in tumorigenesis have not yet been elucidated. Interestingly, decreased expression of miR-101 was found in all six hepatoma cell lines examined and in as high as 94.1% of HCC tissues, compared with their nontumor counterparts. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-101 dramatically suppressed the ability of hepatoma cells to form colonies in vitro and to develop tumors in nude mice. We also found that miR-101 could sensitize hepatoma cell lines to both serum starvation- and chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that miR-101 significantly repressed the expression of luciferase carrying the 3'-untranslated region of Mcl-1 and reduced the endogenous protein level of Mcl-1, whereas the miR-101 inhibitor obviously up-regulated Mcl-1 expression and inhibited cell apoptosis. Moreover, silencing of Mcl-1 phenocopied the effect of miR-101 and forced expression of Mcl-1 could reverse the proapoptotic effect of miR-101. These results indicate that miR-101 may exert its proapoptotic function via targeting Mcl-1. Taken together, our data suggest an important role of miR-101 in the molecular etiology of cancer and implicate the potential application of miR-101 in cancer therapy.","['Su, Hang', 'Yang, Jian-Rong', 'Xu, Teng', 'Huang, Jun', 'Xu, Li', 'Yuan, Yunfei', 'Zhuang, Shi-Mei']","['Su H', 'Yang JR', 'Xu T', 'Huang J', 'Xu L', 'Yuan Y', 'Zhuang SM']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MIRN101 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN101 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Transfection']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2886 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2886 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;69(3):1135-42. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2886.

Although several mouse leukemia models have been well established, the genes deregulated in both human and murine leukemia cells have not been studied systematically. We performed a serial analysis of gene expression in both human and murine MLL-ELL or MLL-ENL leukemia cells and identified 88 genes that seemed to be significantly deregulated in both types of leukemia cells, including 57 genes not reported previously as being deregulated in MLL-associated leukemias. These changes were validated by quantitative PCR. The most up-regulated genes include several HOX genes (e.g., HOX A5, HOXA9, and HOXA10) and MEIS1, which are the typical hallmark of MLL rearrangement leukemia. The most down-regulated genes include LTF, LCN2, MMP9, S100A8, S100A9, PADI4, TGFBI, and CYBB. Notably, the up-regulated genes are enriched in gene ontology terms, such as gene expression and transcription, whereas the down-regulated genes are enriched in signal transduction and apoptosis. We showed that the CpG islands of the down-regulated genes are hypermethylated. We also showed that seven individual microRNAs (miRNA) from the mir-17-92 cluster, which are overexpressed in human MLL rearrangement leukemias, are also consistently overexpressed in mouse MLL rearrangement leukemia cells. Nineteen possible targets of these miRNAs were identified, and two of them (i.e., APP and RASSF2) were confirmed further by luciferase reporter and mutagenesis assays. The identification and validation of consistent changes of gene expression in human and murine MLL rearrangement leukemias provide important insights into the genetic base for MLL-associated leukemogenesis.","['Li, Zejuan', 'Luo, Roger T', 'Mi, Shuangli', 'Sun, Miao', 'Chen, Ping', 'Bao, Jingyue', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Jayathilaka, Nimanthi', 'Johnson, Deborah S', 'Wang, Lili', 'Lavau, Catherine', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Tseng, Charles', 'Zhang, Xiuqing', 'Wang, Jian', 'Yu, Jun', 'Yang, Huanming', 'Wang, San Ming', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Thirman, Michael J']","['Li Z', 'Luo RT', 'Mi S', 'Sun M', 'Chen P', 'Bao J', 'Neilly MB', 'Jayathilaka N', 'Johnson DS', 'Wang L', 'Lavau C', 'Zhang Y', 'Tseng C', 'Zhang X', 'Wang J', 'Yu J', 'Yang H', 'Wang SM', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J', 'Thirman MJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-ELL fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-3381 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3381 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;69(3):1109-16. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3381.

Analysis of Hox mutant mouse lines has revealed a panoply of phenotypes indicative of the broad range of Hox genes action throughout embryonic and postnatal life. Although Hox genes have been the subject of extensive research in the last two decades, the comprehension of the mechanisms involved in their regulation and function still remains elusive. Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge about one Hox gene family member, Hoxa5. The phenotypic survey of Hoxa5 mutant mice has unveiled the crucial role of this gene in regulating morphogenesis and specifying regional identity along the embryo. A majority of Hoxa5 mutant pups die at birth from defective respiratory tract. Surviving mutants present deficient alveolar septation revealing the importance of Hoxa5 during formation and maturation of the lung. Hoxa5 also participates in the morphogenesis of the digestive tract as well as that of the thyroid and mammary glands. Hoxa5 expression is restricted to the mesenchyme, and its action appears to be mediated through the control of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during organogenesis. The implication of Hoxa5 in tumorigenesis has also been documented. In breast cancer, Hoxa5 down-regulation may impact on p53 gene expression, contributing to the oncogenic process. In contrast, the loss of Hoxa5 function limits leukaemia associated with specific chromosomal translocations. Thus, inappropriate Hoxa5 gene expression may disrupt normal growth and differentiation programs causing neoplasia. Hox gene function is intimately linked to its correct expression. Regulation of Hoxa5 expression requires multiple cis-acting regions, some encompassing coding sequences from neighboring genes. Moreover, it is complicated by the presence of several transcription units. Together these data enlighten the importance of Hox cluster organization in Hoxa5 function.","['Boucherat, Olivier', 'Guillou, Francois', 'Aubin, Josee', 'Jeannotte, Lucie']","['Boucherat O', 'Guillou F', 'Aubin J', 'Jeannotte L']","[""Centre de recherche en cancerologie de l'Universite Laval, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, L'Hotel-Dieu de Quebec, 9, rue McMahon, Quebec G1R 2J6, Canada.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,"['0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Embryo, Mammalian/physiology', 'Embryonic Development', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung/embryology/growth & development/physiology', 'Morphogenesis/genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Pregnancy', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['00/00/0D/51/ [pii]', '10.1051/medsci/200925177 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2009 Jan;25(1):77-82. doi: 10.1051/medsci/200925177.,10.1051/medsci/200925177 [doi],,,,,,,30,,Hoxa5: un maitre d'oeuvre a multiples facettes.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the T-cell insufficiency in ATL is present before the disease onset or occurs as a consequence of the disease. We investigated T-cell responses against Tax protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals at earlier stages of HTLV-1-infection, including 21 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) and four patients with smoldering-type ATL (sATL), whose peripheral lymphocyte count was in normal range. About 30% of samples tested showed clear Tax-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma producing responses. Proviral loads in this group were significantly lower than those in the other less-specific response group. The latter group was further divided to two subgroups with or without emergence of Tax-specific responses following depletion of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)(+) cells that contained HTLV-1-infected cells. In the PBMCs with Tax-specific responses, CD8(+) cells efficiently suppressed HTLV-1 p19 production in culture.

The significance of alternative lengthening of telomeres has been suggested in DNA mismatch repair system-deficient cells; however, much remains unknown in human malignancies. In this study, we investigated the telomere maintenance mechanism in gastric carcinoma. In formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of the high frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and non-MSI-H gastric carcinomas, there was no difference in telomere length monitored by telomere intensity ratio using telomere-fluorescent in situ hybridization. Immunoreactivity of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, was detected in 48% of MSI-H gastric carcinomas. The frequency was significantly lower than that in non-MSI-H gastric carcinomas (86%, P = 0.02). Conversely, the number of the alternative lengthening of telomeres-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs) detected by combined promyelocytic leukemia immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescent in situ hybridization was statistically higher (57%) in the MSI-H gastric carcinomas compared to that in non-MSI-H gastric carcinomas (19%, P = 0.026). The cases with hTERT(+)APBs(-) were more frequent in non-MSI-H gastric carcinomas (76%) than in MSI-H gastric carcinomas (24%), and the cases with hTERT(-)APBs(+) were more frequent in MSI-H gastric carcinomas (33%) than in non-MSI-H gastric carcinomas (10%). These results suggest that alternative lengthening of telomeres-mediated telomere maintenance plays an important role for microsatellite instability-mediated stomach carcinogenesis, as well as the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, although the incidence of MSI-H is low. Defects of the mismatch repair system may lead to homeologous recombination of telomeric ends for the telomerase-independent telomere maintenance in gastric carcinomas.","['Omori, Yasuhiro', 'Nakayama, Fumihito', 'Li, Dong', 'Kanemitsu, Kiyonori', 'Semba, Shuho', 'Ito, Akihiko', 'Yokozaki, Hiroshi']","['Omori Y', 'Nakayama F', 'Li D', 'Kanemitsu K', 'Semba S', 'Ito A', 'Yokozaki H']","['Division of Pathology, Department of Pathology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Mismatch Repair', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Microsatellite Instability', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/03/26 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1063 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01063.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Mar;100(3):413-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01063.x.

Biochem. 2007 , 362 , 245 - 251 ; 2007 , 371 , 52 - 61 ). In the present paper, we released O-glycans from some leukemia and epithelial cells using the apparatus, and compared the profiles of O-glycans among these cells after fluorescent labeling of the released glycans with 2-aminobenzoic acid. The fluorescent labeled glycans were analyzed using a combination of HPLC and off-line MALDI-(QIT)TOF mass spectrometry We found that leukemia cells generally showed simple glycan profiles and commonly contained sialyl-T (NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAc) and disialyl-T (NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3(NeuAcalpha2-6)GalNAc) antigens as major O-glycans. In contrast, epithelial cancer cell lines usually showed extremely complex profiles. We found that polylactosamine-type O-glycans were abundantly present in MKN45 cells. Especially, we found characteristic glycans, of which Galbeta1-3 residue of core1 structure is modified with biantennary polylactosamine units. In contrast, this cell line did not contain polylactosamine-type N-glycans ( J. Proteome Res. 2006 , 5 , 88 - 97 ). These results suggest that the different biosynthetic pathways for N- and O-glycans are proposed. The method presented here will accelerate the speed for comprehensive analysis of O-glycans in biological samples and will be a powerful tool for clinical/biochemical analysis in cancer biology.","['Yamada, Keita', 'Kinoshita, Mitsuhiro', 'Hayakawa, Takao', 'Nakaya, Shuuichi', 'Kakehi, Kazuaki']","['Yamada K', 'Kinoshita M', 'Hayakawa T', 'Nakaya S', 'Kakehi K']","['School of Pharmacy, Kinki University, Higashi-Osaka, 577-8502 Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,['0 (Polysaccharides)'],IM,"['Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Epithelial Cells/*chemistry/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/*methods']",2009/01/22 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/22 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1021/pr800710f [doi]', '10.1021/pr800710f [pii]']",ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2009 Feb;8(2):521-37. doi: 10.1021/pr800710f.,10.1021/pr800710f [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying T-cell immunologic deficiencies in CLL. METHODS: Freshly isolated CD3(+) T cells from patients with a diagnosis of CLL and healthy donors were analyzed by gene expression profiling. Activated T cells from 20 patients with CLL were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against mutated and unmutated autologous B cells and DAUDI, K562 and P815 cell lines. To investigate T-cell mediated cytotoxicity in vivo, we co-transplanted OKT3-activated T lymphocytes and autologous B-cell CLL (B-CLL) cells into NOD/SCID mice. RESULTS: Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood T cells from B-CLL patients showed 25 down-regulated, and 31 up-regulated, genes that were mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, cytoskeleton formation, vesicle trafficking and T-cell activation. After culture, the T-cell count remained unchanged, CD8 cells expanded more than CD4 and a cytotoxicity index >30% was present in 5/20 patients. Cytotoxicity against B autologous leukemic cells did not correlate with B-cell mutational status. Only activated T cells exerting cytotoxicity against autologous leukemic B cells prevented CLL in a human-mouse chimera. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that patients with CLL are affected by a partial immunologic defect that might be somewhat susceptible to repair. This study identifies the molecular pathways underlying T-cell deficiencies in CLL and shows that cytotoxic T-cell functions against autologous B-CLL can be rebuilt at least in part in vitro and in vivo.","['Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Moretti, Lorenzo', 'Terenzi, Adelmo', 'Bazzucchi, Federico', 'Del Papa, Beatrice', 'Bazzucchi, Moira', 'Ciurnelli, Raffaella', 'Lucchesi, Alessandro', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Rosati, Emanuela', 'Marconi, Pier Francesco', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Tabilio, Antonio']","['Di Ianni M', 'Moretti L', 'Terenzi A', 'Bazzucchi F', 'Del Papa B', 'Bazzucchi M', 'Ciurnelli R', 'Lucchesi A', 'Sportoletti P', 'Rosati E', 'Marconi PF', 'Falzetti F', 'Tabilio A']","[""Department of Internal Medicine and Public Health, Chair of Hematology, University of L'Aquila, Italy. mauro.diianni@cc.univaq.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/physiology']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['907912692 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240802666035 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2009;11(1):86-96. doi: 10.1080/14653240802666035.,10.1080/14653240802666035 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr-Abl kinase stimulates the production of H(2)O(2), which in turn activates Abl kinase. We therefore evaluated whether N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger improves imatinib efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of imatinib and NAC either alone or in combination were assessed on Bcr-Abl(+) cells to measure apoptosis. Role of nitric oxide (NO) in NAC-induced enhanced cytotoxicity was assessed using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs of nitric oxide synthase isoforms. We report that imatinib-induced apoptosis of imatinib-resistant and imatinib-sensitive Bcr-Abl(+) CML cell lines and primary cells from CML patients is significantly enhanced by co-treatment with NAC compared to imatinib treatment alone. In contrast, another ROS scavenger glutathione reversed imatinib-mediated killing. NAC-mediated enhanced killing correlated with cleavage of caspases, PARP and up-regulation and down regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic family of proteins, respectively. Co-treatment with NAC leads to enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Involvement of eNOS dependent NO in NAC-mediated enhancement of imatinib-induced cell death was confirmed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) specific pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs. Indeed, NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) also enhanced imatinib-mediated apoptosis of Bcr-Abl(+) cells. CONCLUSION: NAC enhances imatinib-induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl(+) cells by endothelial nitric oxide synthase-mediated production of nitric oxide.","['Rakshit, Srabanti', 'Bagchi, Jayashree', 'Mandal, Labanya', 'Paul, Kausik', 'Ganguly, Dipyaman', 'Bhattacharjee, Sandip', 'Ghosh, Monidipa', 'Biswas, Nabendu', 'Chaudhuri, Utpal', 'Bandyopadhyay, Santu']","['Rakshit S', 'Bagchi J', 'Mandal L', 'Paul K', 'Ganguly D', 'Bhattacharjee S', 'Ghosh M', 'Biswas N', 'Chaudhuri U', 'Bandyopadhyay S']","['The Department of Infectious Diseases & Immunology, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0305-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 Mar;14(3):298-308. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0305-7.,10.1007/s10495-008-0305-7 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether indomethacin, which inhibits cyclooxygenases, is able to overcome doxorubicin resistance in K562/ADR leukemia cells. Indomethacin at 10 microM increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and vincristine in K562/ADR cells. Intracellular glutathione content was elevated in K562/ADR cells. Indomethacin treatment decreased glutathione content and glutathione-conjugates in K562/ADR cells. Increased expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) was observed in K562/ADR cells, but this expression was decreased by indomethacin treatment. The activity of the gamma-GCS promoter from K562/ADR cells decreased after indomethacin treatment in MDA231 cells.

However, the mechanisms behind these effects remain elusive. In this study, we found that different concentrations of selenite triggered different signal pathways in human leukemia NB4 cells. Low concentrations of selenite elicited mild endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mediated cell survival by activating unfolded protein response signaling, whereas high concentrations of selenite induced severe ER stress and caused cell death by activation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factors GADD153. In addition, selenite at low concentrations activated other anti-apoptotic pathways, such as AKT and ERK, whereas high concentrations of selenite induced activation of p53 and oxidative stress, which mediated the antitumor activity of selenite by causing mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series and review of reported cases in the English-language literature. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric center. PATIENTS: The study included all children with a confirmed diagnosis of VLP by inspection and with complete clinical information. The sources for patient identification were a prospectively kept database and a review of the English-language literature, conducted on PubMed since 1966, as well as a bibliography search. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Charts and literature were reviewed for demographics, primary diagnosis, other diagnoses, and duration and method of treatment. The prevalence of VLP, locally, was also calculated. RESULTS: Four children (3 boys and 1 girl) were identified in our database over a 5(1/2)-year period, and 10 children (1 girl, 8 boys, and 1 with sex omitted) were described in the English-language literature. Four children had unilateral vocal fold paralysis only, all left-sided. The median age was 2.6 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the underlying diagnosis in 8 patients. Two patients had Down syndrome, and 1 patient had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1. Only 2 patients required tracheotomies, and 1 patient was treated temporarily with bilevel positive-pressure ventilation. The median duration of paralysis was 6.8 weeks. The prevalence of VLP was 1.36%. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that VLP is probably underreported and possibly underdiagnosed. Endoscopic inspection is a must in all patients with airway symptoms who are receiving vincristine therapy. Early recognition of VLP is mandatory, as it is reversible, has a good prognosis, and usually needs only interruption of vincristine therapy and conservative treatment.","['Kuruvilla, George', 'Perry, Shirley', 'Wilson, Beverly', 'El-Hakim, Hamdy']","['Kuruvilla G', 'Perry S', 'Wilson B', 'El-Hakim H']","[""Pediatric Otolaryngology Service, Division of Pediatric Surgery, The Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,8603209,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects', 'Vocal Cord Paralysis/*chemically induced']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['135/1/101 [pii]', '10.1001/archoto.2008.514 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2009 Jan;135(1):101-5. doi: 10.1001/archoto.2008.514.,10.1001/archoto.2008.514 [doi],,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restriction activity requires capsid (CA)-specific recognition by the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM5alpha. To better understand the restriction mechanism, nine charge-cluster-to-triple-alanine mutants in the TRIM5alpha PRYSPRY domain were assessed for CA-specific restriction activity. Five mutants distributed along the TRIM5alpha PRYSPRY primary sequence disrupted restriction activity against N-tropic murine leukemia virus and equine infectious anemia virus. Modeling of the TRIM5alpha PRYSPRY domain based on the crystal structures of PRYSPRY-19q13.4.1, GUSTAVUS, and TRIM21 identified a surface patch where disruptive mutants clustered. All mutants in this patch retained CA-binding activity, a reticular distribution in the cytoplasm, and steady-state protein levels comparable to those of the wild type. Residues in the essential patch are conserved in TRIM5alpha orthologues and in closely related paralogues. The same surface patch in the TRIM18 and TRIM20 PRYSPRY domains is the site of mutants causing Opitz syndrome and familial Mediterranean fever. These results indicate that, in addition to CA-specific binding, the PRYSPRY domain possesses a second function, possibly binding of a cofactor, that is essential for retroviral restriction activity by TRIM5alpha.","['Sebastian, Sarah', 'Grutter, Christian', 'Strambio de Castillia, Caterina', 'Pertel, Thomas', 'Olivari, Silvia', 'Grutter, Markus G', 'Luban, Jeremy']","['Sebastian S', 'Grutter C', 'Strambio de Castillia C', 'Pertel T', 'Olivari S', 'Grutter MG', 'Luban J']","['Department of Microbiology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Capsid Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00432-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00432-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Apr;83(7):3365-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00432-08.

For example, C57BL/6 mice, which are resistant to Friend MLV (F-MLV), encode a APOBEC3 gene different from that encoded by F-MLV-susceptible BALB/c mice; the predominant RNA produced in C57BL/6 mice lacks exon 5 (mA3(-5)) and encodes a protein with 15 polymorphic amino acids. It has also been reported that BALB/c mice produce only a variant RNA that lacks exon 2 (mA3(-2)). In this study, we examined the effect of these polymorphic APOBEC3 proteins on MMTV infection. We found that the major RNA made in C57BL/6 and B10.BR mice lacks exon 5 but that BALB/c and C3H/HeN mice predominantly express an RNA that contains all nine exons. In addition to producing the splice variant, C57BL/6 and B10.BR cells and tissues had levels of mA3 RNA fivefold higher than those from BALB/c and C3H/HeN mice. A cloned C57BL/6-derived mA3 protein lacking exon 5 inhibited MMTV infection better than a cloned full-length protein derived from 129/Ola RNA when packaged into MMTV virions. We also tested dendritic cells derived from different inbred mouse strains for their abilities to be infected by MMTV and showed that susceptibility to infection correlated with the presence of the exon 5-encoding allele. In vivo susceptibility to infection cosegregated with the inherited mA3 allele in a C57BL/6 x BALB/c backcross analysis. Moreover, virus produced in vivo in the mammary tissue of mA3 knockout and BALB/c mice was more infectious than that produced in the tissue of C57BL/6 mice. These data indicate that mA3 plays a role in the genetics of susceptibility and resistance to MMTV infection.","['Okeoma, Chioma M', 'Petersen, Josiah', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Okeoma CM', 'Petersen J', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology and Abramson Family Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/virology', 'Exons', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA Precursors/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02536-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02536-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Apr;83(7):3029-38. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02536-08.

OBJECTIVE: The current study reports the immunologic characterization of a hypoallergenic variant of the major mite allergen Der p 1. METHODS: The recombinant proform of Der p 1 (ProDer p 1) was expressed in Escherichia coli (ProDer p 1 coli), purified and characterized at the level of its secondary structure, and IgE and T-cell reactivities. Moreover, the prophylactic potential of ProDer p 1 coli vaccinations was evaluated in a murine Der p 1 sensitization model. RESULTS: After purification and refolding, ProDer p 1 coli remained aggregated with a higher beta-sheet content and altered Der p 1 conformational epitopes compared with the correctly folded monomeric ProDer p 1 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both ProDer p 1 forms were able to retain the Der p 1-specific T-cell reactivity but direct ELISA, competitive inhibition, and rat basophil leukemia assays clearly showed that ProDer p 1 coli displays a very weak IgE reactivity. Mice vaccinations with aggregated ProDer p 1 adjuvanted with alum induced a T(H)1-biased immune response that prevented the subsequent allergic response after Der p 1 sensitization and airway challenge with aerosolized mite extracts. Furthermore, ProDer p 1 coli treatment inhibited the development of airway eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine. CONCLUSION: Aggregated forms of Der p 1 could represent hypoallergens suitable for the prevention of mite allergy.","['Walgraffe, David', 'Matteotti, Christel', 'El Bakkoury, Mohamed', 'Garcia, Lida', 'Marchand, Celine', 'Bullens, Dominique', 'Vandenbranden, Michel', 'Jacquet, Alain']","['Walgraffe D', 'Matteotti C', 'El Bakkoury M', 'Garcia L', 'Marchand C', 'Bullens D', 'Vandenbranden M', 'Jacquet A']","[""Laboratoire d'Allergologie Experimentale, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires, Charleroi, Belgium.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Dermatophagoides)', '0 (Arthropod Proteins)', '0 (Bronchoconstrictor Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines)', '0W5ETF9M2K (Methacholine Chloride)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus antigen p 1)']",IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Dermatophagoides/genetics/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Arthropod Proteins', 'Basophils/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Bronchial Hyperreactivity/immunology/prevention & control', 'Bronchoconstrictor Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eosinophilia/immunology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-5/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Methacholine Chloride/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pyroglyphidae/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(08)02236-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2008.11.038 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 May;123(5):1150-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.11.038.

IL-5-mediated transmembrane signal transduction involves both Lyn-mitogen-activated protein kinases and Janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether additional signaling molecules/pathways are critically involved in IL-5-mediated eosinophil survival. METHODS: Eosinophil survival and apoptosis were measured in the presence and absence of IL-5 and defined pharmacologic inhibitors in vitro. The specific role of the serine/threonine kinase proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) 1 was tested by using HIV-transactivator of transcription fusion proteins containing wild-type Pim-1 or a dominant-negative form of Pim-1. The expression of Pim-1 in eosinophils was analyzed by means of immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Although pharmacologic inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) by LY294002, wortmannin, or the selective PI3K p110delta isoform inhibitor IC87114 was successful in each case, only LY294002 blocked increased IL-5-mediated eosinophil survival. This suggested that LY294002 inhibited another kinase that is critically involved in this process in addition to PI3K. Indeed, Pim-1 was rapidly and strongly expressed in eosinophils after IL-5 stimulation in vitro and readily detected in eosinophils under inflammatory conditions in vivo. Moreover, by using specific protein transfer, we identified Pim-1 as a critical element in IL-5-mediated antiapoptotic signaling in eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: Pim-1, but not PI3K, plays a major role in IL-5-mediated antiapoptotic signaling in eosinophils.","['Andina, Nicola', 'Didichenko, Svetlana', 'Schmidt-Mende, Jan', 'Dahinden, Clemens A', 'Simon, Hans-Uwe']","['Andina N', 'Didichenko S', 'Schmidt-Mende J', 'Dahinden CA', 'Simon HU']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (IC 87114)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (SD 1029)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/enzymology/immunology', 'Interleukin-5/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/immunology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/immunology/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin', 'Xanthenes/pharmacology']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(08)02354-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2008.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 Mar;123(3):603-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.12.004.

However, the available methodologies to detect such fusions all have their distinct short-comings. RESULTS: We describe a novel oligonucleotide microarray strategy whereby one can screen for all known oncogenic fusion transcripts in a single experiment. To accomplish this, we combine measurements of chimeric transcript junctions with exon-wise measurements of individual fusion partners. To demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, we designed a DNA microarray containing 68,861 oligonucleotide probes that includes oligos covering all combinations of chimeric exon-exon junctions from 275 pairs of fusion genes, as well as sets of oligos internal to all the exons of the fusion partners. Using this array, proof of principle was demonstrated by detection of known fusion genes (such as TCF3:PBX1, ETV6:RUNX1, and TMPRSS2:ERG) from all six positive controls consisting of leukemia cell lines and prostate cancer biopsies. CONCLUSION: This new method bears promise of an important complement to currently used diagnostic and research tools for the detection of fusion genes in neoplastic diseases.","['Skotheim, Rolf I', 'Thomassen, Gard O S', 'Eken, Marthe', 'Lind, Guro E', 'Micci, Francesca', 'Ribeiro, Franclim R', 'Cerveira, Nuno', 'Teixeira, Manuel R', 'Heim, Sverre', 'Rognes, Torbjorn', 'Lothe, Ragnhild A']","['Skotheim RI', 'Thomassen GO', 'Eken M', 'Lind GE', 'Micci F', 'Ribeiro FR', 'Cerveira N', 'Teixeira MR', 'Heim S', 'Rognes T', 'Lothe RA']","['Department of Cancer Prevention, Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. rolf.i.skotheim@rr-research.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (TMPRSS2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2008/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-8-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-8-5 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2009 Jan 19;8:5. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-8-5.,10.1186/1476-4598-8-5 [doi],20090119,,PMC2633275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BioCleanse deploys a combination of chemicals and several high pressure rinses to achieve standardized sterility assurance levels. This method produces sterile grafts without reducing allograft bone biomechanical properties and effectively removes cells, lipids, and other sources of antigenic material from human allografts for clinical use. METHODS: In this investigation, BioCleanse is evaluated for its potential in removing xenograft antigens from bovine bone grafts followed by immunologic evaluation in the subcutaneous pouch of immunocompetent rats. The alpha-galactosyl (alpha-gal) epitope with the structure Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R constitutes a critical component of xenoantigens and its removal using BioCleanse from bovine bone was compared with tissue levels of unprocessed bone. The relative degree of antigen removal was also determined through measuring the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and through the use of histologic grading of cellular infiltrates into bone. RESULTS: Compact cortical bone inhibited immune cell migration but cancellous bone demonstrated cellular increase and bone resorption in the untreated control group. The alpha-gal xenoantigen level was significantly lower in both cortical (P < 0.001) and cancellous bone (P < 0.001) compared with controls. TNF-alpha levels were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced compared with untreated controls when human acute monocytic leukemia cells were exposed to cortical or cancellous bone. CONCLUSIONS: BioCleanse effectively removed xenoantigens and inflammatory markers justifying a follow up study in primates to determine these benefits in a model that is primed with preformed xeno-antibodies responsible for hyperacute rejection in hard tissues.","['Supronowicz, Peter', 'Zhukauskas, Rasa', 'York-Ely, Amanda', 'Wicomb, Winston', 'Thula, Taili', 'Fleming, Laraine', 'Cobb, Ronald R']","['Supronowicz P', 'Zhukauskas R', 'York-Ely A', 'Wicomb W', 'Thula T', 'Fleming L', 'Cobb RR']","['Biotechnology Developement Department, RTI Biologics Inc., Alachua, FL 32616, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Xenotransplantation,Xenotransplantation,9438793,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Trisaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (alpha-galactosyl epitope)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*analysis/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Immunoassay', 'Rats', 'Sterilization/*methods', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*methods', 'Trisaccharides/analysis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/immunology/isolation & purification']",2009/01/21 09:00,2009/06/13 09:00,['2009/01/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [medline]']","['XEN502 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3089.2008.00502.x [doi]']",ppublish,Xenotransplantation. 2008 Nov-Dec;15(6):398-406. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3089.2008.00502.x.,10.1111/j.1399-3089.2008.00502.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, 10 microM thalidomide treatment markedly increased the expression of the early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) at both mRNA and protein levels in HL-60 leukemic cells. Thalidomide treatment significantly decreased the invasive cells number through Matrigel and human umbilical vein endothelial cells when compared with the controls. Moreover, the inhibitory effects could be markedly abolished by Egr-1 gene silencing with siRNA technology. Our data indicated thalidomide could suppress leukemia cell invasion and migration by upregulation of Egr-1, suggesting a novel mechanism of thalidomide in the treatment of leukemia.

A beneficial impact of alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells has been reported for myeloid malignancies, but has been questionable for B-lineage ALL. We analysed lysis of primary paediatric precursor-B-ALL blasts by 285 NK cell clones to investigate whether HLA class I expression on the blasts and phenotypic killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) expression on NK cells affect the lytic activity against ALL blasts. Precursor-B-ALL blasts with low HLA-I expression were lysed by a majority (79%) of NK cell clones, whereas those with high HLA-I expression showed low susceptibility to NK clones independent of their KIR expression patterns. NK cell activity against susceptible blasts was regulated by differential surface expression of the three major KIRs (CD158a, CD158b, CD158e). NK clones with none of these three KIRs or a single KIR that recognized no ligand, were not inhibited by the targets and exerted higher lysis (P = <0.0005) in comparison to NK clones expressing KIRs with a ligand on the ALL blasts. In conclusion, the quantity of HLA-I expression on precursor-B-ALL blast regulates overall NK cell susceptibility; in case of reduced HLA expression, differential surface expression of KIRs affects NK cell alloreactivity against those blasts.","['Feuchtinger, T', 'Pfeiffer, M', 'Pfaffle, A', 'Teltschik, H-M', 'Wernet, D', 'Schumm, M', 'Lotfi, R', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Lang, P']","['Feuchtinger T', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Pfaffle A', 'Teltschik HM', 'Wernet D', 'Schumm M', 'Lotfi R', 'Handgretinger R', 'Lang P']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany. tobias.feuchtinger@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/11/10 06:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2008398 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.398 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2009 Jun;43(11):875-81. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.398.

We have identified Gadd45alpha as a downregulated gene in response to constitutive signaling from two FLT3 mutants (FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD) commonly found in AML, and a leukemogenic GM-CSF receptor trans-membrane mutant (GMR-V449E). GADD45A mRNA downregulation is also associated with FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Sustained ERK1/2 signaling contributes significantly to receptor-mediated downregulation of Gadd45alpha mRNA in FDB1 cells expressing activated receptor mutants, and in the FLT3-ITD(+) cell line MV4;11. Knockdown of Gadd45alpha with shRNA led to increased growth and survival of FDB1 cells and enforced expression of Gadd45alpha in FDB1 cells expressing FLT3-ITD or GMR-V449E resulted in reduced growth and viability. Gadd45alpha overexpression in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell lines also resulted in reduced growth associated with increased apoptosis and G(1)/S cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of Gadd45alpha in FDB1 cells expressing GMR-V449E was sufficient to induce changes associated with myeloid differentiation suggesting Gadd45alpha downregulation contributes to the maintenance of receptor-induced myeloid differentiation block. Thus, we show that ERK1/2-mediated downregulation of Gadd45alpha by sustained receptor signaling contributes to growth, survival and arrested differentiation in AML.","['Perugini, M', 'Kok, C H', 'Brown, A L', 'Wilkinson, C R', 'Salerno, D G', 'Young, S M', 'Diakiw, S M', 'Lewis, I D', 'Gonda, T J', ""D'Andrea, R J""]","['Perugini M', 'Kok CH', 'Brown AL', 'Wilkinson CR', 'Salerno DG', 'Young SM', 'Diakiw SM', 'Lewis ID', 'Gonda TJ', ""D'Andrea RJ""]","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Hanson Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Gadd45a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mutation/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*physiology']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008349 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.349 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):729-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.349.

A total of 1972 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated in the Adult Lymphoma Treatment Study Group (ALTSG) from 1998 to 2007. Nineteen cases of de novo DLBCL with the dual translocation were identified. The dual translocation was observed in 19 of 394 patients with DLBCL (10 males and 9 females, with a median age of 61 years). The dual translocation was observed significantly more frequently among patients with high lactate dehydrogenase levels, B symptoms, bone marrow involvement and advanced stage. Immunophenotyping was performed and showed DLBCL with a germinal center type in the majority of cases. Progression-free survival and overall survival rates were significantly lower in patients with the dual translocation than in those with other translocation. DLBCL patients with concurrent t(14;18) and 8q24 translocations have very poor prognosis. Even if patients had a complete response to chemotherapy, they subsequently suffered early relapse.

We conducted a prospective multicenter study of EPO-beta and ATRA in anemic MDS patients with marrow blasts <10% and either previous ESA failure or relapse, endogenous EPO >500 U/l or other cytopenia(s) (absolute neutrophilic count <1.0 G/l or platelets <50 G/l). A total of 59 patients were evaluable after 12 weeks of treatment. The erythroid response rates according to IWG 2000 and 2006 criteria, respectively, were as follows: overall: 49 and 36%; patients with previous ESA failure (n=28): 43 and 32%; patients with endogenous EPO >500 U/l (n=18): 11 and 19%; patients transfused >2 red blood cells units/month (n=28) 43 and 39%. Only one neutrophil, but no platelet response, and no major side effect were observed.

Risk models based primarily on studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors imply that low-level exposure to ionizing radiation, including ubiquitous natural background radiation, also raises the risk of childhood leukaemia. Using two sets of recently published leukaemia risk models and estimates of natural background radiation red-bone-marrow doses received by children, about 20% of the cases of childhood leukaemia in Great Britain are predicted to be attributable to this source. However, for one of these sets of risk models this attributable fraction is materially dependent on how the radiation-induced risk is assumed to be transferred between the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and Western children. Over a range of annual doses representing the range (0.5-2.5 mSv/year) experienced by most populations, the attributable proportion for the preferred risk-transfer model varies between 8 and 30%, with small deviations from a linear relationship that are largely due to the saturation of the model, although again this range of attributable fractions depends on the assumed transfer of risk between populations.","['Wakeford, R', 'Kendall, G M', 'Little, M P']","['Wakeford R', 'Kendall GM', 'Little MP']","['Dalton Nuclear Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Background Radiation', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008342 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.342 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):770-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.342.

Comprehensive understanding of the surface protein expression patterns of tumor cells and, consequently, the pathogenesis of tumor cells depends on molecular probes against these proteins. To be used effectively for tumor diagnosis, classification and therapy, such probes would be capable of specific binding to targeted tumor cells. Molecular aptamers, designer DNA-RNA probes, can address this challenge by recognizing proteins, peptides and other small molecules with high affinity and specificity. Through a process known as cell-based SELEX, we used live acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to select a group of DNA aptamers, which can recognize AML cells with dissociation constants (Kd's) in the nanomolar range. Interestingly, one aptamer (KH1C12) compared with two control cell lines (K562 and NB4) showed significant selectivity to the target AML cell line (HL60) and could recognize the target cells within a complex mixture of normal bone marrow aspirates. The other two aptamers KK1B10 and KK1D04 recognize targets associated with monocytic differentiation.

Patients and donors were categorized according to their degree of KIR-ligand compatibility in the graft-versus-host direction by determining whether or not they expressed HLA-C group 1 or 2, HLA-Bw4 or HLA-A3/-A11. Both HLA-C/-B KIR-ligand- and HLA-A-A3/-A11 KIR-ligand-incompatible UCBT showed a trend to improved LFS (P=0.09 and P=0.13, respectively). Sixty-nine donor-patient pairs were HLA-A, -B or -C KIR-ligand incompatible and 149 compatible. KIR-ligand-incompatible UCBT showed improved LFS (hazards ratio=2.05, P=0.0016) and overall survival (OS) (hazards ratio=2.0, P=0.004) and decreased RI (hazards ratio=0.53, P=0.05). These results were more evident for AML transplant recipients (2-year LFS and RI with or without KIR-ligand incompatibility 73 versus 38% (P=0.012), and 5 versus 36% (P=0.005), respectively). UCBT for acute leukemia in CR from KIR-ligand-incompatible donors is associated with decreased RI and improved LFS and OS.","['Willemze, R', 'Rodrigues, C A', 'Labopin, M', 'Sanz, G', 'Michel, G', 'Socie, G', 'Rio, B', 'Sirvent, A', 'Renaud, M', 'Madero, L', 'Mohty, M', 'Ferra, C', 'Garnier, F', 'Loiseau, P', 'Garcia, J', 'Lecchi, L', 'Kogler, G', 'Beguin, Y', 'Navarrete, C', 'Devos, T', 'Ionescu, I', 'Boudjedir, K', 'Herr, A-L', 'Gluckman, E', 'Rocha, V']","['Willemze R', 'Rodrigues CA', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz G', 'Michel G', 'Socie G', 'Rio B', 'Sirvent A', 'Renaud M', 'Madero L', 'Mohty M', 'Ferra C', 'Garnier F', 'Loiseau P', 'Garcia J', 'Lecchi L', 'Kogler G', 'Beguin Y', 'Navarrete C', 'Devos T', 'Ionescu I', 'Boudjedir K', 'Herr AL', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V']","['Clinical Research Unit, Eurocord Office, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis, Universite de Paris VII, Paris, France. r.willemze@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/physiology', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008365 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.365 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Mar;23(3):492-500. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.365.

In zebrafish, survivin undergoes gene duplication. Survivin1 (sur1) has been shown to mediate angiogenesis but not hematopoiesis. In this study, we examined survivin2 (sur2) with particular reference to its role in primitive hematopoiesis during zebrafish development. sur2 was expressed predominantly in the intermediate cell mass (ICM, site of primitive hematopoiesis). Morpholino (MO) targeting at intron1-exon2 junction of sur2 significantly reduced green fluorescent protein(+) (erythroid) cell population in transgenic Tg (gata1:gfp) embryos at 18 h post-fertilization (h.p.f.; wild type: 4.49+/-0.15%; Sur2(MO) embryos: 2.22+/-0.12%, P=0.02). Molecular targeting was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and MO specificity by successful sur2 mRNA rescue. sur2 MO also downregulated genes associated with hematopoietic stem cells (scl, lmo2), erythroid (gata1, alpha- and beta-embryonic hemoglobins) as well as early (pu.1) and late (mpo, l-plastin) myelomonocytic lineages at 12 and 18 h.p.f. This was associated with an increase in apoptosis in the ICM and alteration of cell-cycle status of erythroid cells. Both effects were caspase dependent. In conclusion, sur2 is important in maintaining hematopoietic stem and lineage committed cells during zebrafish development, by virtue of its antiapoptotic activity in a caspase dependent and cell autonomous fashion.","['Ma, A C H', 'Chung, M I S', 'Liang, R', 'Leung, A Y H']","['Ma AC', 'Chung MI', 'Liang R', 'Leung AY']","['Division of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Birc5b protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspases', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Embryonic Development', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*physiology', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*physiology']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008363 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.363 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):712-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.363.

The aim of the study is to characterize bone marrow (BM) derived MSC from patients with MDS using: kinetic studies, immunophenotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and genetic changes by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). In all 36 cases of untreated MDS were studied. MDS-MSC achieved confluence at a significantly slower rate than donor-MSC, and the antigenic expression of CD105 and CD104 was lower. Array-CGH studies showed DNA genomic changes that were proved not to be somatic. These results were confirmed by FISH. To confirm that genomic changes were also present in freshly obtained MSCs they were enriched by sorting BM cells with the following phenotype: CD45(-)/CD73(++)/CD34(-)/CD271(++). They also showed genomic changes that were confirmed by FISH. To analyze the relationship of these aberrations with clinical-biological data an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed, two clusters were identified: the first one included the 5q- syndrome patients, whereas the other incorporated other MDS.

Here, we sought to identify the effects of targeting cyclin D in MM. We first confirmed cyclin D mRNA overexpression in 42 of 64 (65%) patient plasma cells. Silencing cyclin D1 resulted in >50% apoptotic cell death suggesting its validity as a potential therapeutic target. We next evaluated P276-00, a clinical-grade small-molecule cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor as a way to target the cyclins. P276-00 resulted in dose-dependent cytotoxicity in MM cells. Cell-cycle analysis confirmed either growth arrest or caspase-dependent apoptosis; this was preceded by inhibition of Rb-1 phosphorylation with associated downregulation of a range of cyclins suggesting a regulatory role of P276-00 in cell-cycle progression through broad activity. Proliferative stimuli such as interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-1 and bone-marrow stromal cell adherence induced cyclins; P276-00 overcame these growth, survival and drug resistance signals. Because the cyclins are substrates of proteasome degradation, combination studies with bortezomib resulted in synergism. Finally, in vivo efficacy of P276-00 was confirmed in an MM xenograft model.

There were 85 patients with 17p (p53) deletion with multiple aberrations and 20 patients with a 17p (p53) deletion as single aberration or with only one additional chromosomal abnormality. None of the p53-deleted patients displayed additional low-risk aberrations, like t(8;21) or inv(16). Significant positive association between p53 deletion and other high-risk factors was identified for del(5q) (P<0.001), -5 (P<0.001) and -7 (P<0.05). The molecular risk factors FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation showed an inverse correlation to the p53 deletion in complex aberrant patients (P<0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed p53 deletion without multiple aberrations as an independent negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P<0.001), relapse risk (P=0.028) and overall survival (P<0.001). Thus, the single p53 deletion should be considered as a high-risk aberration for future risk-adapted treatment strategies in AML.","['Seifert, H', 'Mohr, B', 'Thiede, C', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Schakel, U', 'Illmer, T', 'Soucek, S', 'Ehninger, G', 'Schaich, M']","['Seifert H', 'Mohr B', 'Thiede C', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Schakel U', 'Illmer T', 'Soucek S', 'Ehninger G', 'Schaich M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008375 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.375 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):656-63. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.375.

These ligands are missing or expressed at very low levels on leukaemic cells; furthermore, they can be shed by tumour cells and inhibit cytolytic activity of lymphocytes. Herein, we show that in vivo administration of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium valproate (VPA) to patients affected with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) M3 or M1 respectively, leads to the induction of transcription and expression of NKG2D-L at the surface of leukaemic cells. Apparently, no detectable shedding of the soluble form of these molecules was found in patients' sera. Conversely, AML blasts from patients treated with chemotherapy not including ATRA or VPA did not show any induction of NKG2D-L transcription. Furthermore, upon therapy with ATRA or VPA, leukaemic blasts become able to trigger lytic granule exocytosis by autologous CD8(+) T and natural killer lymphocytes, as shown by CD107a mobilization assay, followed by leukaemic cell lysis. These findings indicate that ATRA and VPA may contribute to the activation of cytolytic effector lymphocytes in vivo, possibly enhancing their anti-leukaemic effect.","['Poggi, A', 'Catellani, S', 'Garuti, A', 'Pierri, I', 'Gobbi, M', 'Zocchi, M R']","['Poggi A', 'Catellani S', 'Garuti A', 'Pierri I', 'Gobbi M', 'Zocchi MR']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Translational Oncology, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy. alessandro.poggi@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (ULBP2 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008354 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.354 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):641-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.354.

From the AML1 gene, at least three isoforms, AML1a, AML1b and AML1c, are produced through alternative splicing. AML1a interferes with the function of AML1b/1c, which are often called AML1. In this study, we found a higher expression level of AML1a in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M2 patients in comparison to the controls. Additionally, AML1a represses transcription of promoter of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor mediated by AML1b, indicating that AML1a antagonized the effect of AML1b. To investigate the role of AML1a in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis in vivo, murine bone marrow mononuclear cells were transduced with AML1a and then transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, which developed lymphoblastic leukemia after transplantation. Taken together, these results indicate that overexpression of AML1a may be an important contributing factor to leukemogenesis.","['Liu, X', 'Zhang, Q', 'Zhang, D-E', 'Zhou, C', 'Xing, H', 'Tian, Z', 'Rao, Q', 'Wang, M', 'Wang, J']","['Liu X', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang DE', 'Zhou C', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008350 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.350 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):739-45. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.350.

Recent studies provide evidence that implicate c-Abl as a mediator for fibrotic responses induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but the precise mechanisms underlying this novel oncogene function are unknown. Here, we report that when expressed in normal fibroblasts, a constitutively active mutant of Abl that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) stimulated the expression and transcriptional activity of the early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), lacking c-Abl, were resistant to TGF-beta stimulation. Responsiveness of these MEFs to TGF-beta could be rescued by wild-type c-Abl, but not by a kinase-deficient mutant form of c-Abl. Furthermore, Abl kinase activity was necessary for the induction of Egr-1 by TGF-beta in normal fibroblasts, and Egr-1 was required for stimulation of collagen by Bcr-Abl. Lesional skin fibroblasts in mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis of skin displayed evidence of c-Abl activation in situ, and elevated phospho-c-Abl correlated with increased local expression of Egr-1. Collectively, these results position Egr-1 downstream of c-Abl in the fibrotic response, delineate a novel Egr-1-dependent intracellular signaling mechanism that underlies the involvement of c-Abl in certain TGF-beta responses, and identify Egr-1 as a target of inhibition by imatinib. Furthermore, the findings show in situ activation of c-Abl paralleling the upregulated tissue expression of Egr-1 that accompanies fibrosis. Pharmacological targeting of c-Abl and its downstream effector pathways may, therefore, represent a novel therapeutic approach to blocking TGF-beta-dependent fibrotic processes.","['Bhattacharyya, S', 'Ishida, W', 'Wu, M', 'Wilkes, M', 'Mori, Y', 'Hinchcliff, M', 'Leof, E', 'Varga, J']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Ishida W', 'Wu M', 'Wilkes M', 'Mori Y', 'Hinchcliff M', 'Leof E', 'Varga J']","['Division of Rheumatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Bleomycin/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/genetics', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/*physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/physiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad2 Protein/physiology', 'Smad3 Protein/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/03/26 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [medline]']","['onc2008479 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.479 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Mar 12;28(10):1285-97. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.479.

These diseases are primarily diagnosed on the basis of morphological features of affected cells, which appear in peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymphoid organs. By taking advantage of the repetitive accessibility of the neoplastic cells within the peripheral blood / and/or bone marrow aspirates, morphological tests are conducted not only for diagnosis but also for evaluation of clinical outcomes and prognosis, suggesting that the morphological features are considered as a clinical biomarker in hematopoietic malignancies. However, remarkable progress in molecular targeted therapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has improved the long-term prognosis of patients with hematopoietic malignancies, and some patients are curable. Under such modern strategies for therapy, monitoring of minimal residual disease(MRD), which is morphologically undetectable, is required to guide proper management of the disease by evaluation of an optimal response to therapy and early detection of disease relapse. At present, both immunophenotypes(surface markers)and chimeric fusion genes(e. g. BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia)characteristic of hematopoietic malignant cells are analyzed as clinically useful biomarkers to monitor MRD by two highly sensitive methods, multiparameter flow cytometry and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. On the other hand, serum markers reflecting the size of the tumor mass are clinically available to monitor the disease progression in mass-forming hematopoietic malignancies: e. g., soluble IL-2 receptor for lymphoma and M-protein or free light chain for multiple myeloma.","['Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Nosaka, Kisato']","['Kawaguchi T', 'Nosaka K']","['Dept. of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Although it is well defined that PML NB is a site recruiting sumoylated proteins, the mechanism by which PML protein regulates the process remains unclear. Here we show that PML3, a specific PML isoform, interacts with and recruits TIP60 to PML NBs. Our biochemical characterization demonstrates that PML3 physically interacts with TIP60 via its N-terminal 364 amino acids. Importantly, this portion of TIP60 is sufficient to target to the PML NBs, suggesting that PML3-TIP60 interaction is sufficient for targeting TIP60 to the NBs. The PML3-TIP60 interaction is specific, since the region of TIP60 binding is not conserved in other PML isoforms. The physical interaction between PML3 and TIP60 protects TIP60 from Mdm2-mediated degradation, suggesting that PML3 competes with MDM2 for binding to TIP60. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis indicates that the PML3-TIP60 interaction modulates the nuclear body distribution and mobility of TIP60. Conversely, the distribution and mobility of TIP60 are perturbed in PML3-deficient cells, accompanied by aberrations in DNA damage-repairing response. Thus, PML3 orchestrates the distribution, dynamics, and function of TIP60. Our findings suggest a novel regulatory mechanism by which the PML3 and TIP60 tumor suppressors cooperate to ensure genomic stability.","['Wu, Quan', 'Hu, Haixiang', 'Lan, Jianping', 'Emenari, Chibuzo', 'Wang, Zhiyong', 'Chang, Kang-Sang', 'Huang, He', 'Yao, Xuebiao']","['Wu Q', 'Hu H', 'Lan J', 'Emenari C', 'Wang Z', 'Chang KS', 'Huang H', 'Yao X']","['Anhui Key Laboratory for Cellular Dynamics and Chemical Biology and National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Nanoscale, Hefei 230027, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genomic Instability/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32421-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M807590200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 27;284(13):8747-59. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M807590200.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 1153 patients with T-cell or NK cell lymphomas, 126 patients (9.6%) with ATL were represented in this project. All were categorized as aggressive ATL, i.e. acute or lymphoma type, and 87% fell into the lymphoma type. RESULTS: The median age was 62 years and the male to female ratio was 1.2 : 1. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) by univariate analysis were the presence of B symptoms (P = 0.018), platelet count <150 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.065), and the International Prognostic Index (IPI; P = 0.019). However, multivariate analysis indicated that only the IPI was an independent predictor of OS. Combination chemotherapy including anthracyclines was given as the initial therapy in 109 of the 116 patients (94%) who received treatment, and the overall and complete response rates were 70% and 34%, respectively. However, there was no survival benefit for those receiving an anthracycline-containing regimen. CONCLUSION: Patients with aggressive ATL have a poor clinical outcome and the IPI is a useful model for predicting outcome in ATL of the lymphoma type.","['Suzumiya, J', 'Ohshima, K', 'Tamura, K', 'Karube, K', 'Uike, N', 'Tobinai, K', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Vose, J M', 'Armitage, J O', 'Weisenburger, D D']","['Suzumiya J', 'Ohshima K', 'Tamura K', 'Karube K', 'Uike N', 'Tobinai K', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Vose JM', 'Armitage JO', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. junsuzu@fukuokau.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)40713-8 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn696 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2009 Apr;20(4):715-21. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn696.

However, in order to apply HSCT to patients in a manner that enables long term survival, transplant-related mortality must be minimized by eliminating the risk for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and by reducing the toxicity of the conditioning protocol. T-cell depleted bone marrow transplants (TDBMT) have been shown to adequately eliminate GVHD. However, even in leukemia patients undergoing supralethal conditioning, mismatched TDBMT are vigorously rejected. This barrier can be overcome through the modulatory activity of CD34 cells, which are endowed with veto activity, by the use of megadose stem cell transplants. In mice, megadoses of Sca+lin-hematopoietic stem cells can induce mixed chimerism following sub-lethal conditioning. Nevertheless, the number of human CD34 cells that can be harvested is not likely to be sufficient to overcome rejection under reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), which might be acceptable in recipients of organ transplantation. To address this challenge, we investigated a novel source of veto cells, namely anti 3rd-party cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) which are depleted of GVH reactivity, combined with megadoses of purified stem cells and a RIC protocol. This approach might provide a safer modality for the induction of durable chimerism.","['Ophir, Eran', 'Reisner, Yair']","['Ophir E', 'Reisner Y']","['Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Immunology, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', '*Transplantation Tolerance']",2009/01/20 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2008/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(08)00380-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2008.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2009 Jun;9(6):694-700. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.12.009.

In addition, amplification is obtained in less than 1h by incubating a single tube in a water bath. The data obtained by the LAMP assay applied to field samples were compared with PCR and serological tests for BLV. The results showed a high level of agreement with these serological methods, but there was one animal positive only by the LAMP assay. When the blood was collected from the cow after 6 months, the BLV antibody was detected. This suggested that the LAMP assay could help the detection of the cattle in the early stage of BLV infection.

In the absence of the viral Vif protein hA3G is packaged into virions and during reverse transcription in a recipient cell it deaminates cytosines, leading to G-->A hypermutation and inactivation of the viral DNA. Unlike humans, who carry seven APOBEC3 genes, mice only carry one, mA3. Thus the role of mA3 in restriction of retroviral infection could be studied in mA3 -/- knockout mice, where the gene is inactivated. M-MuLV-infected mA3 -/- mice showed substantially higher levels of infection at very early times compared to wild-type mice (ca. 2 logs at 0-10 days), particularly in the bone marrow and spleen. Restriction of M-MuLV infection was studied ex vivo in primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) that express or lack mA3, using an M-MuLV-based retroviral vector expressing enhanced jellyfish green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The results indicated that mA3 within the virions as well as mA3 in the recipient cell contribute to resistance to infection in BMDCs. Finally, M-MuLV-infected mA3 +/+ mice developed leukemia more slowly compared to animals lacking one or both copies of mA3 although the resulting disease was similar (T-lymphoma).

METHODS: Thirty-eight newly diagnosed ALL children were enrolled. Of the 38 patients, 31 achieved complete remission (CR) and 12 relapsed. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was employed to measure blood GYPC and TRIP3 gene expression. Twenty blood samples from normal children were used as controls. RESULTS: Blood GYPC expression in newly diagnosed ALL children was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.01) and the CR group (p<0.01). The expression of GYPC gene in the CR group was similar to that in the control group. Other than the control group (p<0.01) and the CR group (p<0.01), the GYPC expression of the relapse group was significantly higher than that in the newly diagnosed group (p<0.01).

This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of morphological assessment of bone marrow blasts during remission induction and determination of minimal residual disease (MRD) after remission induction. METHODS: From January 1998 to May 2003, 193 children with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled on the ALL-XH-99 protocol. Blast cell count in the bone marrow was examined on day 19 of remission induction and by the completion of remission induction. MRD was measured with the flow cytometry. Event-free survival (EFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the distributions of EFS were compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: The 4-year EFS was significantly worse in patients with > or = 5% lymphoblasts in the bone marrow on day 19 as compared to those with <5% lymphoblasts on that date (42.59%+/- 14.28% vs 74.24%+/- 6.67%; p< 0.01). The 4-year EFS was significantly worse in patients with any amount of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow on the remission date as compared to that of other patients with no morphologically identifiable blasts (63.47%+/-9.23% vs 76.41%+/- 6.09%; p<0.05). The patients with MRD <0.01 had significantly better outcome than those with a level > or = 0.01% (15-month EFS:94.44%+/-5.40% vs 23.81%+/- 20.26%; p<0.01).

Constitutive activated TKs stimulate multiple signaling pathways responsible for DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. During the last few years, thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying tyrosine kinase's activity led to novel cancer therapy using TKs blockers. These drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and leukemias. The most successful example of kinase blockers is Imatinib (Imatinib mesylate, Gleevec, STI571), the inhibitor of Bcr/Abl oncoprotein, which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The introduction of STI571 for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed.

Early childhood infections may protect against acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in children with and without DS. We examined whether maternal infections and health conditions during pregnancy were associated with acute leukemia in children with DS. PROCEDURE: We conducted a case-control study of 158 children with DS and leukemia (including 97 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 61 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and 173 children with DS during the period 1997-2002. Maternal interview included information about 14 maternal conditions during gestation that are likely to induce an inflammatory response. We evaluated their prevalence in cases and controls. Five of these were common enough to allow analyses by leukemia subtype. RESULTS: Vaginal bleeding was the most frequent (18% cases, 25% controls) and was associated with a reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.33-0.99) for all cases combined. Other variables, while showing a potential trend toward reduced risk had effect estimates, which were imprecise and not statistically significant. In contrast, amniocentesis was marginally associated with an increased risk of AML (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.90-4.69). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this exploratory investigation suggest that some health conditions during pregnancy may be relevant in childhood leukemogenesis. Larger epidemiological studies and other model systems (animal, clinical studies) may provide a clearer picture of the potential association and mechanisms.","['Ognjanovic, Simona', 'Puumala, Susan', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Olshan, Andrew F', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Ognjanovic S', 'Puumala S', 'Spector LG', 'Smith FO', 'Robison LL', 'Olshan AF', 'Ross JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. ognja001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Welfare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21914 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 May;52(5):602-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21914.,10.1002/pbc.21914 [doi],,"['R01 CA075169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA75169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075169-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 HD050924/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2659730,,,,,['NIHMS88565'],,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: NB patients received induction with high-dose cyclophosphamide (4,200 mg/m(2))-doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2))-vincristine (cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8), and high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m(2))-etoposide (600 mg/m(2)) (cycles 3, 5, 7). Bone marrow was examined every 1-3 months for > or =36 months, with inclusion of extensive chromosomal studies 1-3 months post-induction and 1-2x/year thereafter. RESULTS: One hundred eight four patients received 5 (n = 76), 6 (n = 45), 7 (n = 59), or 8 (n = 4) cycles. Eight patients developed SL/MDS (only one each in the 5- and 6-cycle groups), at 12-50 months, including two cases detected in surveillance studies. Among 108 patients who received > or =6 cycles, the 5-year cumulative incidence was 7.1% (95% CI: 2%, 12.2%), versus 0% among 54 patients who received 5 cycles without maintenance oral etoposide. Five-year cumulative incidences were 1.46%, 2.28%, and 8.47% among patients in the 5-, 6-, and 7-cycle groups, with fewer cycles having a significantly lower risk (P = 0.048). There was no significant association of risk with potentially leukemogenic consolidative treatments (targeted radiotherapy, myeloablative therapy, and oral etoposide). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of dose-intensive cycles significantly decreases the risk of SL/MDS, yielding 5-year rates matching the low range (0.4-2.2%) reported for moderate-dose combination chemotherapy regimens used against other pediatric solid tumors.","['Kushner, Brian H', 'Kramer, Kim', 'Modak, Shakeel', 'Qin, Li-Xuan', 'Yataghena, Karima', 'Jhanwar, Suresh C', 'Cheung, Nai-Kong V']","['Kushner BH', 'Kramer K', 'Modak S', 'Qin LX', 'Yataghena K', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Cheung NK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA. kushnerb@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Neuroblastoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21931 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):17-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21931.,10.1002/pbc.21931 [doi],,"['P01 CA106450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA106450-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4079040,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):3-6.

Here we analysed their effect on the miR-17-92 cluster overexpressed in several types of cancer, including T-ALL. The pri-miR-17-92 polycistron encodes micro-RNAs (miRNAs), which decrease E2F1 protein expression, regulating proliferation and/or apoptosis. Quantification of pri-miR-17-92 in T-ALL cell lines suggested an implication of the NK-like homeodomain proteins in transcriptional regulation. Lentiviral-mediated overexpression of NKX2-5 in the T-ALL cell line MOLT-4 consistently resulted in increased miR-17-92 pri-miRNA levels and decreased amounts of E2F1 protein. Induction of apoptosis by treating miR17-92 or E2F1 transduced T-ALL cells with etoposide led to reduced or enhanced cell viability, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of pri-miR-17-92 in T-ALL patients indicated elevated expression in those bearing TLX1/3 positive cells.

Several studies have established the role of ERK in cell cycle progression from G(1) to S phase in response to mitogen, but the role of ERK after the restriction point is less clarified. In this study, we used models of aphidicolin and nocodazole-synchronized HL-60 and NB4 leukemia cell lines to determine the kinetics of ERK activity during the progression of the cell cycle and to test the effects of commercially available inhibitors on G(2)/M progression of synchronized leukemia cells. In aphidicolin-synchronized cells, the activity of ERK was low during early S phase and increased at late S and G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The presence of MEK inhibitors PD 98059 and U0126 caused a delay in G(2)/M phase. In nocodazole-synchronized cells, the activity of ERK was low during M/G(1) transition and MEK inhibitors had no effects on return of the cells to G(1) phase.

However, size limits their vascular and tissue penetration. To mimic monoclonal antibody binding, nanomolecules have been synthesized, shown specific for the beta subunit of HLA-DR10, and selective for cells expressing this protein. Selective high affinity ligands (SHALs) containing the 3-(2-([3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy)-anilino)-3-oxopropanionic acid (Ct) ligand residualized and had antilymphoma activity against expressing cells. Herein, we show the extraordinary potency in mice with human lymphoma xenografts of a tridentate SHAL containing this ligand. After titrating antilymphoma activity in cell culture, a randomized preclinical study of a tridentate SHAL containing the Ct ligand was conducted in mice with established and aggressive human lymphoma xenografts. Mice having HLA-DR10 expressing Raji B- or Jurkat's T-lymphoma xenografts were randomly assigned to receive either treatment with SHAL at a dose of 100 ng i.p. weekly for 3 consecutive weeks, or to be untreated. Primary end-points were cure, overall response rates and survival. Toxicity was also evaluated in these mice, and a USFDA general safety study was conducted in healthy Balb/c mice. In Raji cell culture, the threshold and IC50 concentrations for cytotoxic activity were 0.7 and 2.5 nmol (pm/ml media), respectively. When compared to treated Jurkat's xenografts or untreated xenografts, Raji xenografts treated with the SHAL showed an 85% reduction in hazard of death (P=0.014; 95% confidence interval 32-95% reduction). There was no evidence for toxicity even after i.p. doses 2000 times greater than the treatment dose associated with cure of a majority of the mice with Raji xenografts.

Serum TK levels correlate to the proliferative activity of tumor disease. Determinations of TK levels have so far relied on radio enzyme assay (REA) and experimental ELISA methods, which have limited the clinical use of this biomarker, although recent studies in dogs with malignant lymphoma (ML) demonstrate its wide potential. A non-radiometric method based on a competitive immunoassay with specific anti-3'-azido-deoxythymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) antibodies has been further developed into the fully automated Liaison TK assay (DiaSorin). Sera from healthy dogs (n=30), and dogs with leukemia (LEUK) (n=35), ML (n=84), non-hematological tumors (n=50), and inflammatory disease (n=14) were tested using both methods. Lymphoma and LEUK samples were available before and during chemotherapy. The coefficients of variation for the Liaison TK assay in this study were 6.3 and 3.4% (low/high TK, respectively), and the correlation between TK REA (X) and the Liaison TK assay (Y) was y=0.9203x+1.3854 (R2=0.9501). The TK1 levels measured during chemotherapy gave very clear differences between dogs in complete remission and dogs out of remission.

After routine banding cytogenetic analysis 45% of AML patients show a normal karyotype (NK-AML). For a better understanding of development and progression in AML, it is important to find markers which could be primary genetic aberrations. Therefore, in this study 31 patients with NK-AML were analyzed by new high resolution molecular cytogenetic approaches. A combination of multitude multicolor banding and metaphase microdissection-based comparative genomic hybridization revealed deletions of the subtelomeric regions in 6% of the studied cases. According to these results, locus-specific probes for the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 12 and 13 were applied on 22 of the studied 31 NK-AML cases. Surprisingly, 50% of them showed deletions or duplications. These aberrations occurred in the in vitro proliferating as well as in the non-proliferating cells. Meta-analysis of the aberrant regions revealed that they often include genes known to be associated with tumors, e.g. RASA3 on chromosome 13. These results implicate that aberrations in the subtelomeric regions of NK-AML occur quite often and may be considered as primary genetic changes, and should not be neglected in future diagnostic approaches.","['Gross, Madeleine', 'Mkrtchyan, Hasmik', 'Glaser, Melanie', 'Fricke, Hans Jorg', 'Hoffken, Klaus', 'Heller, Anita', 'Weise, Anja', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Gross M', 'Mkrtchyan H', 'Glaser M', 'Fricke HJ', 'Hoffken K', 'Heller A', 'Weise A', 'Liehr T']","['Institut fur Humangenetik und Anthropologie, D-07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Feb;34(2):417-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell stress is sensed by pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family, which regulate the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, from mitochondria. Exposure of cells to hyperthermia results in the activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bax, which plays an essential role in cytochrome c release. Heat directly affects Bax activity in vitro; however, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-xL, can suppress this activation, suggesting that a second heat-sensitive step must be breached before apoptosis ensues in cells exposed to hyperthermia. Here we show that heat shock causes the loss of Mcl-1 protein. Depletion of Noxa by short hairpin RNA protected cells from hyperthermia by preventing Mcl-1 degradation. Heat shock caused the dissociation of Noxa from Mcl-1, which allowed binding of the BH3-containing ubiquitin ligase Mule followed by Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Overexpression of Hsp70, which prevents heat-induced Bax activation, stabilized Mcl-1 protein levels in heat-shocked cells. This resulted from reduced Mule binding and ubiquitination as well as enhanced Mcl-1 expression compared with cells without Hsp70. Our results demonstrate that loss of Mcl-1 is a critical heat-sensitive step leading to Bax activation that is controlled by Hsp70.","['Stankiewicz, A R', 'Livingstone, A M', 'Mohseni, N', 'Mosser, D D']","['Stankiewicz AR', 'Livingstone AM', 'Mohseni N', 'Mosser DD']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']","['cdd2008189 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.189 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Apr;16(4):638-47. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2008.189.

The BH3-only Bcl-2 family members Puma and Noxa are critical pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets of p53, a major mediator of Myc-induced apoptosis and suppressor of Myc-induced tumorigenesis. Hence, we have explored the impact of their individual or combined loss on myc-driven lymphomagenesis. Notably, Puma deficiency both increased B-lineage cells and accelerated the development of B lymphoma, accompanied by leukaemia, but not of pre-B lymphoma. Noxa deficiency alone also increased B-lineage cells but did not accelerate lymphomagenesis. However, its deficiency combined with loss of one puma allele produced more rapid onset of both pre-B and B lymphomas than did loss of a single puma allele alone. Nevertheless, the acceleration evoked by loss of both genes was not as marked as that caused by p53 heterozygosity. These results show that Puma imposes a significant, and Noxa a minor barrier to c-Myc-driven lymphomagenesis. They also indicate that additional BH3-only proteins probably also drive Myc-induced apoptosis and that non-apoptotic functions of p53 may contribute substantially to its tumour suppressor role.","['Michalak, E M', 'Jansen, E S', 'Happo, L', 'Cragg, M S', 'Tai, L', 'Smyth, G K', 'Strasser, A', 'Adams, J M', 'Scott, C L']","['Michalak EM', 'Jansen ES', 'Happo L', 'Cragg MS', 'Tai L', 'Smyth GK', 'Strasser A', 'Adams JM', 'Scott CL']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/*genetics']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['cdd2008195 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.195 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 May;16(5):684-96. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2008.195.

When DKK-1 was neutralized by anti-DKK-1 antibodies, or when the expression of DKK-1 was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi), the inhibitory effects of MSCs on K562 cell proliferation were attenuated. We also provide evidence that the expression of DKK-1 by MSCs is regulated by NANOG, a transcriptional factor ubiquitously expressed in some stem cells. Using the Cellmax artificial capillary modules that eliminate the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs, we further showed that MSCs were able to inhibit proliferation of K562 cells in a humoral microenvironment.

A major BCR stereotype in CLL is shared by immunoglobulin G-switched cases utilizing the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable 4-34 (IGHV4-34) gene. Increased titers of IGHV4-34 antibodies are detected in selective clinical conditions, including infection by B-cell lymphotropic viruses, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In this context, we sought evidence for persistent activation by EBV and CMV in CLL cases expressing the IGHV4-34 gene. The study group included 93 CLL cases with an intentional bias for the IGHV4-34 gene. On the basis of real-time PCR results for CMV/EBV DNA, cases were assigned to three groups: (1) double-negative (59/93); (2) single-positive (CMV- or EBV-positive; 25/93); (3) double-positive (9/93). The double-negative group was characterized by heterogeneous IGHV gene repertoire. In contrast, a bias for the IGHV4-34 gene was observed in the single-positive group (9/25 cases; 36%). Remarkably, all nine double-positive cases utilized the IGHV4-34 gene; seven of nine cases expressed the major BCR stereotype as described above. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the interactions of CLL progenitor cells expressing distinctive IGHV4-34 BCRs with viral antigens/superantigens might facilitate clonal expansion and, eventually, leukemic transformation.

We thus investigated the association between IGH allele copy numbers and the IGH rearrangement patterns in 90 HeH BCP ALL with either two (13%) or three copies (87%) of chromosome 14. HeH cases (44%) had an oligoclonal IGH rearrangement pattern, but true oligoclonality--after correction for the respective copy number of IGH alleles--was only 16%.

We conclude that downregulation of APM components may play a role in the failure of immuno-surveillance and may therefore contribute to relapse in acute leukaemia.","['Hoves, S', 'Aigner, M', 'Pfeiffer, C', 'Laumer, M', 'Obermann, E C', 'Mackensen, A']","['Hoves S', 'Aigner M', 'Pfeiffer C', 'Laumer M', 'Obermann EC', 'Mackensen A']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (LMP7 protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008391 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.391 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):877-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.391.

Whether GCs regulate miRNA-encoding transcription units is unknown. We investigated miRNA/mirtron expression and GC regulation in 8 leukemia/lymphoma in vitro models and 13 ALL children undergoing systemic GC monotherapy using a combination of expression profiling techniques, real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and northern blotting to detect mature miRNAs and/or their precursors. We found that mature miRNA regulations can be inferred from expression data of their host genes. Although a simple miRNA-initiated canonical pathway to GC-induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest did not emerge, we identified several miRNAs/mirtrons that were regulated by GC in patients and cell lines, including the myeloid-specific miR-223 and the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest-inducing miR15 ~ 16 clusters. In an in vitro model, overexpression of miR15b ~ 16 mimics increased and silencing by miR15b ~ 16 inhibitors decreased GC sensitivity. Thus, the observed complex changes in miRNA/mirtron expression during GC treatment might contribute to the anti-leukemic GC effects in a cell context-dependent manner.","['Rainer, J', 'Ploner, C', 'Jesacher, S', 'Ploner, A', 'Eduardoff, M', 'Mansha, M', 'Wasim, M', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R', 'Trajanoski, Z', 'Niederegger, H', 'Kofler, R']","['Rainer J', 'Ploner C', 'Jesacher S', 'Ploner A', 'Eduardoff M', 'Mansha M', 'Wasim M', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Trajanoski Z', 'Niederegger H', 'Kofler R']","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Polymerase II/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008370 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.370 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):746-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.370.

However, autophagy also plays an important role in removing damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. Defective mitochondria and impaired erythroid maturation are important characteristics of low-risk myelodysplasia. In this study we therefore questioned whether the autophagic clearance of mitochondria might be altered in erythroblasts from patients with refractory anemia (RA, n=3) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, n=6). Ultrastructurally, abnormal and iron-laden mitochondria were abundant, especially in RARS patients. A large proportion (52+/-16%) of immature and mature myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) erythroblasts contained cytoplasmic vacuoles, partly double membraned and positive for lysosomal marker LAMP-2 and mitochondrial markers, findings compatible with autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. In healthy controls only mature erythroblasts comprised these vacuoles (12+/-3%). These findings were confirmed morphometrically showing an increased vacuolar surface in MDS erythroblasts compared to controls (P<0.0001). In summary, these data indicate that MDS erythroblasts show features of enhanced autophagy at an earlier stage of erythroid differentiation than in normal controls. The enhanced autophagy might be a cell protective mechanism to remove defective iron-laden mitochondria.","['Houwerzijl, E J', 'Pol, H-W D', 'Blom, N R', 'van der Want, J J L', 'de Wolf, J Th M', 'Vellenga, E']","['Houwerzijl EJ', 'Pol HW', 'Blom NR', 'van der Want JJ', 'de Wolf JT', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. e.j.houwerzijl@int.umcg.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (LAMP2 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/metabolism/*pathology', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/metabolism/*pathology', '*Autophagy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/*ultrastructure', 'Risk Factors']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008389 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.389 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):886-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.389.

After lentiviral-mediated gene transfer of INPP5D into CD34(+) cells derived from AML patients (n=12) the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent proliferation was reduced in all samples analyzed (average 86%; range 72-93%). An enzymatically inactive form of SHIP1 (D672A) had no effect. In addition, SHIP1 reduced the autonomous proliferation of CD34(+) cells from a patient with a secondary AML who had a very high peripheral blast count (300 x 10(9) l(-1)).

Overexpression of PIM-1 plays a critical role in progression of prostatic and hematopoietic malignancies. Here we describe the generation of a mAb specific for GST-PIM-1, which reacted strongly with most human and mouse cancer tissues and cell lines of prostate, breast, and colon origin but only weakly (if at all) with normal tissues. The mAb binds to PIM-1 in the cytosol and nucleus as well as to PIM-1 on the surface of human and murine cancer cells. Treatment of human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines with the PIM-1-specific mAb resulted in disruption of PIM-1/Hsp90 complexes, decreased PIM-1 and Hsp90 levels, reduced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, reduced phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112 and Ser136, and increased cleavage of caspase-9, an indicator of activation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway. The mAb induced cancer cell apoptosis and synergistically enhanced antitumor activity when used in combination with cisplatin and epirubicin. In tumor models, the PIM-1-specific mAb substantially inhibited growth of the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 in SCID mice and the mouse prostate cancer cell TRAMP-C1 in C57BL/6 mice.

Loss of telomerase function produces short telomeres, potentially resulting in chromosome recombination, end-to-end fusion, and recognition as damaged DNA. We investigated whether mutations in telomerase genes also occur in acute myeloid leukemia. We screened bone marrow samples from 133 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 198 controls for variations in TERT and TERC genes. An additional 89 patients from a second cohort, selected based on cytogenetic status, and 528 controls were further examined for mutations. A third cohort of 372 patients and 384 controls were specifically tested for one TERT gene variant. In the first cohort, 11 patients carried missense TERT gene variants that were not present in controls (P < 0.0001); in the second cohort, TERT mutations were associated with trisomy 8 and inversion 16. Mutation germ-line origin was demonstrated in 5 patients from whom other tissues were available. Analysis of all 3 cohorts (n = 594) for the most common gene variant (A1062T) indicated a prevalence 3 times higher in patients than in controls (n = 1,110; P = 0.0009). Introduction of TERT mutants into telomerase-deficient cells resulted in loss of enzymatic activity by haploinsufficiency. Inherited mutations in TERT that reduce telomerase activity are risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia.

Putative ALL stem cells may be resistant to therapy and subsequent relapses may arise from these cells. We investigated expression of CD133, CD19, and CD38 in pediatric B-ALL. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that karyotypically aberrant cells were present in both CD133(+)/CD19(+) and CD133(+)/CD19(-) subfractions, as were most of the antigen receptor gene rearrangements. However, ALL cells capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and in vivo were derived from the CD133(+)/CD19(-) subfraction. Moreover, these CD133(+)/CD19(-) cells could self-renew to engraft serial nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient recipients and differentiate in vivo to produce leukemias with similar immunophenotypes and karyotypes to the diagnostic samples. Furthermore, these CD133(+)/CD19(-) ALL cells were more resistant to treatment with dexamethasone and vincristine, key components in childhood ALL therapy, than the bulk leukemia population. Similar results were obtained using cells sorted for CD133 and CD38, with only the CD133(+)/CD38(-) subfraction demonstrating xenograft repopulating capacity. These data suggest that leukemia-initiating cells in childhood B-ALL have a primitive CD133(+)/CD19(-) and CD38(-) phenotype.","['Cox, Charlotte V', 'Diamanti, Paraskevi', 'Evely, Roger S', 'Kearns, Pamela R', 'Blair, Allison']","['Cox CV', 'Diamanti P', 'Evely RS', 'Kearns PR', 'Blair A']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39388-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-154187 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 2;113(14):3287-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-04-154187.

TCL1 transgenic mice (TCL1-tg), in which TCL1 is ectopically expressed in mature lymphocytes, develop multiple B- and T-cell leukemia and lymphoma subtypes, supporting an oncogenic role for TCL1 that probably involves AKT and MAPK-ERK signaling pathway augmentation. Additional, largely unknown genetic and epigenetic alterations cooperate with TCL1 during lymphoma progression. We examined DNA methylation patterns in TCL1-tg B-cell tumors to discover tumor-associated epigenetic changes, and identified hypermethylation of sprouty2 (Spry2). Sprouty proteins are context-dependent negative or positive regulators of MAPK-ERK pathway signaling, but their role(s) in B-cell physiology or pathology are unknown. Here we show that repression of Spry2 expression in TCL1-tg mouse and human B-cell lymphomas and cell lines is associated with dense DNA hypermethylation and was reversed by inhibition of DNA methylation. Spry2 expression was induced in normal splenic B cells by CD40/B-cell receptor costimulation and regulated a negative feedback loop that repressed MAPK-ERK signaling and decreased B-cell viability. Conversely, loss of Spry2 function hyperactivated MAPK-ERK signaling and caused increased B-cell proliferation. Combined, these results implicate epigenetic silencing of Spry2 expression in B lymphoma progression and suggest it as a companion lesion to ectopic TCL1 expression in enhancing MAPK-ERK pathway signaling.","['Frank, Matthew J', 'Dawson, David W', 'Bensinger, Steven J', 'Hong, Jason S', 'Knosp, Wendy M', 'Xu, Lizhong', 'Balatoni, Cynthia E', 'Allen, Eric L', 'Shen, Rhine R', 'Bar-Sagi, Dafna', 'Martin, Gail R', 'Teitell, Michael A']","['Frank MJ', 'Dawson DW', 'Bensinger SJ', 'Hong JS', 'Knosp WM', 'Xu L', 'Balatoni CE', 'Allen EL', 'Shen RR', 'Bar-Sagi D', 'Martin GR', 'Teitell MA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1732, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Spry2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism/physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation/physiology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37574-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-156943 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Mar 12;113(11):2478-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-156943.

Here, we evaluated the antitumor effects of the microtubule destabilizing agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to the humanized anti-CD19 antibody hBU12 via a protease-sensitive valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker. hBU12-vcMMAE induced potent tumor cell killing against rituximab-sensitive and -resistant NHL cell lines. CD19 can form heterodimers with CD21, and high levels of CD21 were reported to interfere negatively with the activity of CD19-targeted therapeutics. However, we observed comparable internalization, intracellular trafficking, and drug release in CD21(low) and CD21(high), rituximab-sensitive and -refractory lymphomas treated with hBU12-vcMMAE. Furthermore, high rates of durable regressions in mice implanted with these tumors were observed, suggesting that both rituximab resistance and CD21 expression levels do not impact on the activity of hBU12-vcMMAE. Combined, our data suggest that hBU12-vcMMAE may represent a promising addition to the treatment options for rituximab refractory NHL and other hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Gerber, Hans-Peter', 'Kung-Sutherland, May', 'Stone, Ivan', 'Morris-Tilden, Carol', 'Miyamoto, Jamie', 'McCormick, Renee', 'Alley, Stephen C', 'Okeley, Nicole', 'Hayes, Brad', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, Francisco J', 'McDonagh, Charlotte F', 'Carter, Paul J', 'Benjamin, Dennis', 'Grewal, Iqbal S']","['Gerber HP', 'Kung-Sutherland M', 'Stone I', 'Morris-Tilden C', 'Miyamoto J', 'McCormick R', 'Alley SC', 'Okeley N', 'Hayes B', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri FJ', 'McDonagh CF', 'Carter PJ', 'Benjamin D', 'Grewal IS']","['Department of Preclinical Therapeutics, Seattle Genetics, Bothell, WA 98021, USA. hgerber@seagen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '29VT07BGDA (Citrulline)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)', 'V7I58RC5EJ (monomethyl auristatin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Citrulline/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Dipeptides/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Lysosomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Valine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39245-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-179143 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 30;113(18):4352-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-179143.

Additional immunoperoxidase staining revealed the organisms were consistent with a zygomycete fungus, compatible with C. recurvatus infection.

Here we report the molecular mechanism underlying the development of hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia by FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. When introduced into c-Kit(high)Sca-1(+)Lineage(-) cells, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha conferred cytokine-independent growth on these cells and enhanced their self-renewal, whereas it did not immortalize common myeloid progenitors in in vitro replating assays and transplantation assays. Importantly, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha but not TEL-PDGFRbeta enhanced the development of Gr-1(+)IL-5Ralpha(+) eosinophil progenitors from c-Kit(high)Sca-1(+)Lineage(-) cells. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha also promoted eosinophil development from common myeloid progenitors. Furthermore, when expressed in megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha not only inhibited differentiation toward erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and B-lymphocytes but aberrantly developed eosinophil progenitors from megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors. As for the mechanism of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-induced eosinophil development, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha was found to more intensely activate MEK1/2 and p38(MAPK) than TEL-PDGFRbeta. In addition, a MEK1/2 inhibitor and a p38(MAPK) inhibitor suppressed FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-promoted eosinophil development. Also, reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha augmented the expression of C/EBPalpha, GATA-1, and GATA-2, whereas it hardly affected PU.1 expression. In addition, short hairpin RNAs against C/EBPalpha and GATA-2 and GATA-3KRR, which can act as a dominant-negative form over all GATA members, inhibited FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-induced eosinophil development. Furthermore, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and its downstream Ras inhibited PU.1 activity in luciferase assays. Together, these results indicate that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha enhances eosinophil development by modifying the expression and activity of lineage-specific transcription factors through Ras/MEK and p38(MAPK) cascades.","['Fukushima, Kentaro', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Ezoe, Sachiko', 'Tokunaga, Masahiro', 'Yasumi, Masato', 'Satoh, Yusuke', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Fukushima K', 'Matsumura I', 'Ezoe S', 'Tokunaga M', 'Yasumi M', 'Satoh Y', 'Shibayama H', 'Tanaka H', 'Iwama A', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2, Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/*enzymology/pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32484-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M807489200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 20;284(12):7719-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M807489200.

We postulated that T-ALL originating from early T-cell precursors (ETPs), a recently defined subset of thymocytes that retain stem-cell-like features, would respond poorly to lymphoid-cell-directed therapy. We studied leukaemic cells, collected at diagnosis, to identify cases with ETP features and determine their clinical outcome. METHODS: Leukaemic cells from 239 patients with T-ALL enrolled at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (n=139) and in the Italian national study Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) ALL-2000 (n=100) were assessed by gene-expression profiling, flow cytometry, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis. Probabilities of survival and treatment failure were calculated for subgroups considered to have ETP-ALL or typical T-ALL. FINDINGS: 30 patients (12.6%) had leukaemic lymphoblasts with an ETP-related gene-expression signature or its associated distinctive immunophenotype (CD1a(-), CD8(-), CD5(weak) with stem-cell or myeloid markers). Cases of ETP-ALL showed increased genomic instability, in terms of number and size of gene lesions, compared with those with typical T-ALL. Patients with this form of leukaemia had high risk of remission failure or haematological relapse (72% [95% CI 40-100] at 10 years vs 10% [4-16] at 10 years for patients with typical T-ALL treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital; and 57% [25-89] at 2 years vs 14% [6-22] at 2 years for patients treated in the AIEOP trial). INTERPRETATION: ETP-ALL is a distinct, previously unrecognised, pathobiological entity that confers a poor prognosis with use of standard intensive chemotherapy. Its early recognition, by use of the gene expression and immunophenotypic criteria outlined here, is essential for the development of an effective clinical management strategy.

All over the world, many studies have been made to determine chronological age using dental ages of individuals, but selecting individuals with no chronic or acute sickness as the study group. Cancer is the second most frequent cause of death in children, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer in childhood. Most of the children who survived childhood cancer experienced disturbances in dental development due to cancer therapy or to cancer itself. The aim of this study is to assess dental development in children and teenagers who had suffered from childhood leukemia and were submitted to chemotherapy isolated or associated with radiotherapy, by comparing the dental ages with those corresponding features in a healthy control group. Dental development was analyzed using panoramic radiographs of 92 children divided in two groups: 46 children between 5 and 12 years old, treated for ALL at GRAACC-IOP, UNIFESP, and as a control group, 46 healthy children treated for dental reasons at APCD, Sao Paulo. The dental age of the subjects was estimated using the system of Demirjian et al. [A. Demirjian, H. Goldstein, J.M. Tanner, A new system of dental age assessment, Hum. Biol. 45(2) (1973) 211-227]. A significant difference was found between the chronological and dental age of patients submitted to antineoplasic therapy for ALL, when compared to those of the control group, but there were no significant differences between patients treated with different protocols for ALL. CONCLUSIONS: although the study was within a small group of patients, we could clearly conclude that antineoplastic therapy can interfere in the dental maturity of patients treated for childhood cancer by interfering in dental formation and root development.","['Vasconcelos, Niucha P S', 'Caran, Eliana M M', 'Lee, Maria Lucia', 'Lopes, Nilza N F', 'Weiler, Rosa M E']","['Vasconcelos NP', 'Caran EM', 'Lee ML', 'Lopes NN', 'Weiler RM']","['Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Forensic Sci Int,Forensic science international,7902034,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Determination by Teeth', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Forensic Dentistry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiography, Panoramic', 'Tooth/drug effects/*growth & development/radiation effects', 'Tooth Root/drug effects/*growth & development/radiation effects']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0379-0738(08)00452-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.forsciint.2008.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Forensic Sci Int. 2009 Jan 30;184(1-3):10-4. doi: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2008.11.009.

Most patients with CLL have an indolent clinical course, but it is possible to identify patients with high-risk disease. Younger patients with adverse risk factors will die from their disease, and are therefore candidates for clinical trials exploring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Autologous SCT is feasible and has low treatment-related mortality (TRM); but it is not curative. Myeloablative allogeneic SCT is associated with high treatment-related mortality and, TRM few late relapses, but is applicable to only a small number of CLL patients. The major focus of SCT in CLL has been with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic SCT, which is applicable to the more elderly patient population with this disease and which attempts to exploit the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect that exists in CLL. Steps to further decrease the morbidity and mortality of the RIC SCT, and, in particular, to reduce the incidence of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) remain the major focus. Many potential treatments are available for CLL, and appropriate patient selection and the timing of SCT remain controversial and the focus of ongoing clinical trials. The use of SCT must always be weighed against the risk of the underlying disease, particularly in a setting where improvements in treatment are leading to improved outcome.","['Gribben, John G']",['Gribben JG'],"[""St. Bartholomew's Hospital,Institute of Cancer, Barts and The London School of Medicine, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",2009/01/29 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(08)00471-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.10.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Jan;15(1 Suppl):53-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.10.022.,10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.10.022 [doi],,['P01 CA081534-090008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2668540,,,,30,['NIHMS89442'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring component of Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli and Brussels sprout, is a promising chemopreventive agent as it is reported to possess antimutagenic, antitumorigenic and antiestrogenic properties in experimental studies. The aim of this study was to determine the potential anti-ATLL effects of I3C both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In the in vitro study, I3C inhibited cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, I3C did not exert any inhibitory effect on uninfected T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. I3C prevented the G1/S transition by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, Cdk4 and Cdk6, and induced apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP, survivin and Bcl-2, and by upregulating the expression of Bak. The induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. I3C also suppressed IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and JunD expression, resulting in inactivation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. Inoculation of HTLV-1-infected T cells in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency resulted in tumor growth. The latter was inhibited by treatment with I3C (50 mg/kg/day orally), but not the vehicle control. CONCLUSION: Our preclinical data suggest that I3C could be potentially a useful chemotherapeutic agent for patients with ATLL.","['Machijima, Yoshiaki', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Sawada, Shigeki', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Uchihara, Jun-nosuke', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Machijima Y', 'Ishikawa C', 'Sawada S', 'Okudaira T', 'Uchihara JN', 'Tanaka Y', 'Taira N', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan. k078771@eve.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', 'C11E72455F (indole-3-carbinol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/virology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-7 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Jan 16;6:7. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-7.,10.1186/1742-4690-6-7 [doi],20090116,,PMC2635345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains to be determined, whether this correlation also exists on the level of protein expression. METHOD: Therefore, we investigated both bone marrow and peripheral blood blast cells from six patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using conventional two-dimensional electrophoresis in the first dimension and linear polyacrylamide gels (12%) in the second dimension. Proteins were visualized using the silver staining method and image analysis was performed using the PDQuest system. RESULTS: For each patient over 80 proteins were evaluated in the sample from peripheral blood and bone marrow. We could demonstrate that the protein expression profile of bone marrow did not significantly differ from the expression patterns of peripheral blast cells. CONCLUSION: The proteome-set of leukemic blast cells from marrow and blood, does not differ substantially when drawn from AML patients with over 80 percent blast cells in both compartments. This indicates that in AML, blasts from peripheral blood samples can be considered suitable for investigations of the proteome using 2D-electrophoresis.","['Hutter, Gero', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Poland, Julia', 'Sinha, Pranav', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Hofmann, Wolf-K']","['Hutter G', 'Letsch A', 'Nowak D', 'Poland J', 'Sinha P', 'Thiel E', 'Hofmann WK']","['Department of Internal Medicine III (Hematology, Onkology), Charite Berlin Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany. gero.huetter@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/17 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-7-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-7-7 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2009 Jan 15;7:7. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-7-7.,10.1186/1479-5876-7-7 [doi],20090115,,PMC2630935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of ZAP-70 in B-CLL is a continuum ranging from absent to high, affecting the prognostic reliability of this marker. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 32 patients with B-CLL treated from March 2006 to February 2007 were prospectively studied. Patients were stratified in two groups: those diagnosed with B-CLL within 18 months and a retrospective group diagnosed before 18 months since the beginning of this study. Patients were predominantly males (78.1%), over 60 years old (81.25%). ZAP-70 was detected on EPICX-XL flow cytometer with System II software. Directly conjugated antibodies CD19 PE, ZAP-70 FITC (clone 1E7.2) and CD2 APC were used. Leuoperm was used for permeabilization. All samples with over 20% ZAP-70/CD19 double positive B lymphocytes were considered positive. RESULTS: ZAP-70 was absent in a group of 22 patients with B-CLL diagnosed over 18 months from the beginning of this study, while 2 out of 10 (20%) patients from the group of newly diagnosed patients were ZAP-70(+). During follow up both ZAP-70(+) cases showed worsening of their clinical status resulting to death in one patient. In borderline cases with ZAP-70(+) ranging from 10.9-19.9% there was no correlation of the level of ZAP-70 expression with disease activity or clinical scoring systems. CONCLUSION: Very high percentage of ZAP-70(+) cells is a sign of poor prognosis in B-CLL. Borderline expression of ZAP-70, although more frequent, could not be successfully assigned into a risk group.","['Marjanovic, G', 'Stanojevic, I', 'Jankovic-Velickovic, Lj', 'Hubl, W', 'Marjanovic, V']","['Marjanovic G', 'Stanojevic I', 'Jankovic-Velickovic Lj', 'Hubl W', 'Marjanovic V']","['Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Centre Nis, Serbia. prof.marjanovic@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*blood']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2008 Oct-Dec;13(4):543-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression has also been reported in a subset of neuroendocrine carcinomas, urothelial tumors, Merkel cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and neuroblastoma cell lines. As such, we sought to assess it as a diagnostic marker in the evaluation of pediatric small round blue cell tumors. Tumors selected for evaluation included embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (55 cases), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) (51 cases), neuroblastoma (22 cases), Wilms tumor (18 cases), Ewing Family of Tumors (11 cases), lymphoblastic lymphoma (8 cases), hepatoblastoma (6 cases), and granulocytic sarcoma (3 cases) as either cores in a tissue microarray or whole mount sections. All cases were immunostained using an antibody directed toward PAX5 and immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively according to percentage of nuclear staining. As expected, all B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas were strongly immunoreactive against PAX5. Additionally, all Wilms tumors showed staining of variable intensity, most intensely in the epithelial component. Of the rhabdomyosarcoma cases, 34 of 51 (67%) ARMS were immunoreactive whereas none of the 55 embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cases stained. No other tumor type on the array was immunoreactive toward PAX5. Genetic information was available on 7 ARMS, 5 of which had characteristic translocations involving PAX genes, either t(2:13) or t(1;13). Of the translocation-positive cases, all showed nuclear reactivity toward PAX5, and both the translocation-negative cases did not. Possible explanations of PAX5 staining include aberrant expression of the PAX5 transcription factor, PAX5 expression in normal tissue at the time the tumors most closely recapitulates in development or crossreactivity with another member of the PAX family. PAX3 and PAX7 fusion genes characterize the majority of ARMS making crossreactivity with these proteins an attractive theory, and suggest that PAX5 immunoreactivity may be specific for translocation-positive ARMS. Further study in a larger series of rhabdomyosarcomas is warranted to assess the sensitivity and specificity of PAX5 immunoreactivity for the ARMS variant.","['Sullivan, Lisa M', 'Atkins, Kristen A', 'LeGallo, Robin D']","['Sullivan LM', 'Atkins KA', 'LeGallo RD']","['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hepatoblastoma/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Neuroblastoma/chemistry', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*analysis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/*chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal/chemistry', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/chemistry', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Wilms Tumor/chemistry']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318191614f [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2009 May;33(5):775-80. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318191614f.,10.1097/PAS.0b013e318191614f [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to assess the der(9) deletion status of 48 CML patients in blast crisis (CMLBC). RESULTS: Among the 48 CML patients, 8 (16.7%) showed der(9) deletions, and the deletions were also existent at diagnosis. The median duration of the chronic phase for patients with der(9) deletions was 18 (range 4-38) months compared to 48 (range 0-204) months for patients without deletions (p < 0.001). Der(9) deletions were not associated with increased karyotypic instability. There was no difference in the probability of the der(9) deletions between the cases having progressed to myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the FISH technique could effectively detect der(9) deletions. CML patients with der(9) deletions show more rapid progression and poorer prognosis, and the deletion status is a powerful prognostic factor.","['Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei', 'Wu, Wei', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Zhang, Run', 'Zhang, Su-Jiang', 'Qian, Si-Xuan']","['Li JY', 'Xu W', 'Wu W', 'Zhu Y', 'Qiu HR', 'Zhang R', 'Zhang SJ', 'Qian SX']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['000160578 [pii]', '10.1159/000160578 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2008 Nov;31(11):585-9. doi: 10.1159/000160578.

However, up-front drug resistance occurs in approximately 30% of patients, and molecular mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood. Here, we have uncovered a novel mechanism of primary resistance to FLT3 TKIs in AML: an FLT3 receptor harboring a nonjuxtamembrane ITD atypically integrating into the beta-2 sheet of the first kinase domain (FLT3_ITD627E) induces dramatic up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (MCL-1). Using RNA interference technology, deregulated MCL-1 protein expression was shown to play a major role in conferring the resistance phenotype of 32D_ITD627E cells. Enhanced and sustained binding of the adaptor protein GRB-2 to the FLT3_ITD627E receptor is involved in MCL-1 up-regulation and is independent from TKI (PKC412)-induced inhibition of the receptor kinase. Thus, we describe a new mechanism of primary resistance to TKIs, which operates by reprogramming local and distant signal transduction events of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase. The data presented suggest that particular ITDs of FLT3 may be associated with rewired signaling and differential responsiveness to TKIs.","['Breitenbuecher, Frank', 'Markova, Boyka', 'Kasper, Stefan', 'Carius, Birgit', 'Stauder, Torsten', 'Bohmer, Frank D', 'Masson, Kristina', 'Ronnstrand, Lars', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Fischer, Thomas']","['Breitenbuecher F', 'Markova B', 'Kasper S', 'Carius B', 'Stauder T', 'Bohmer FD', 'Masson K', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Huber C', 'Kindler T', 'Fischer T']","['3rd Medical Department, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39289-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-126664 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 23;113(17):4063-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-126664.

Gene profiling reveals up-regulation of FLT3LG (FLT3 ligand) and BIRC5 (survivin), but down-regulation of SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 in MV4-11-R cells. Hypermethylation of these SOCS genes leads to their transcriptional silencing. Survivin is directly regulated by STAT3. Stimulation of the parental MV4-11 cells with FLT3 ligand increases the expression of survivin and phosphorylated protein STAT1, STAT3, STAT5. Targeting survivin by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in MV4-11-R cells induces apoptosis and augments ABT-869-mediated cytotoxicity. Overexpression of survivin protects MV4-11 from apoptosis. Subtoxic dose of indirubin derivative (IDR) E804 resensitizes MV4-11-R to ABT-869 treatment by inhibiting STAT signaling activity and abolishing survivin expression. Combining IDR E804 with ABT-869 shows potent in vivo efficacy in the MV4-11-R xenograft model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that enhanced activation of STAT pathways and overexpression of survivin are important mechanisms of resistance to ABT-869, suggesting that the STAT pathways and survivin could be potential targets for reducing resistance developed in patients receiving FLT3 inhibitors.","['Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Bi, Chonglei', 'Janakakumara, Jasinghe V', 'Liu, Shaw-Cheng', 'Chng, Wee-Joo', 'Tay, Kian-Ghee', 'Poon, Lai-Fong', 'Xie, Zhigang', 'Palaniyandi, Senthilnathan', 'Yu, Hanry', 'Glaser, Keith B', 'Albert, Daniel H', 'Davidsen, Steven K', 'Chen, Chien-Shing']","['Zhou J', 'Bi C', 'Janakakumara JV', 'Liu SC', 'Chng WJ', 'Tay KG', 'Poon LF', 'Xie Z', 'Palaniyandi S', 'Yu H', 'Glaser KB', 'Albert DH', 'Davidsen SK', 'Chen CS']","['Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (IDR-804)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (N-(4-(3-amino-1H-indazol-4-yl)phenyl)-N1-(2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)urea)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Survivin', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39288-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-156422 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 23;113(17):4052-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-156422.

The novel gene, termed HOTAIRM1 (HOX antisense intergenic RNA myeloid 1), is transcribed antisense to the HOXA genes and originates from the same CpG island that embeds the start site of HOXA1. The transcript appears to be a noncoding RNA containing no long open-reading frame; sucrose gradient analysis shows no association with polyribosomal fractions. HOTAIRM1 is the most prominent intergenic transcript expressed and up-regulated during induced granulocytic differentiation of NB4 promyelocytic leukemia and normal human hematopoietic cells; its expression is specific to the myeloid lineage. Its induction during retinoic acid (RA)-driven granulocytic differentiation is through RA receptor and may depend on the expression of myeloid cell development factors targeted by RA signaling. Knockdown of HOTAIRM1 quantitatively blunted RA-induced expression of HOXA1 and HOXA4 during the myeloid differentiation of NB4 cells, and selectively attenuated induction of transcripts for the myeloid differentiation genes CD11b and CD18, but did not noticeably impact the more distal HOXA genes. These findings suggest that HOTAIRM1 plays a role in the myelopoiesis through modulation of gene expression in the HOXA cluster.","['Zhang, Xueqing', 'Lian, Zheng', 'Padden, Carolyn', 'Gerstein, Mark B', 'Rozowsky, Joel', 'Snyder, Michael', 'Gingeras, Thomas R', 'Kapranov, Philipp', 'Weissman, Sherman M', 'Newburger, Peter E']","['Zhang X', 'Lian Z', 'Padden C', 'Gerstein MB', 'Rozowsky J', 'Snyder M', 'Gingeras TR', 'Kapranov P', 'Weissman SM', 'Newburger PE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Intergenic)', '0 (HOXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1, human)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*DNA, Intergenic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*genetics', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37579-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-162164 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Mar 12;113(11):2526-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-162164.

Recent studies have implicated Hsp90 in transcriptional regulation and an important role for Hsp90 in epigenetic processes has been proposed. Importantly, genetic and pharmacological perturbation of Hsp90 was shown to reveal heritable phenotypic variation and Hsp90 was found to play an important role in buffering genetic and epigenetic variation whose expression led to altered phenotypes. The underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive, however. Here, we show a direct molecular interaction between Hsp90 and Trithorax (Trx). Trx is a member of the TrxG chromatin proteins controlling, together with the members of the Polycomb group, the developmental fate of cells by modulating epigenetic signals. Hsp90 cooperates with Trx at chromatin for maintaining the active expression state of targets like the Hox genes. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 results in degradation of Trx and a concomitant down-regulation of homeotic gene expression. A similar effect is observed with the human orthologue mixed-lineage leukemia.

Here, we identified hidden genomic alterations and novel disease-related regions in normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome samples. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-eight normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome samples were analyzed with high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray using a new algorithm: allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references (AsCNAR). Expression of mRNA in these samples was determined by mRNA microarray analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen samples (49%) showed either one or more genomic abnormalities including duplication, deletion and copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity. Importantly, 12 patients (32%) had copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity, causing duplication of either mutant FLT3 (2 cases), JAK2 (1 case) or AML1/RUNX1 (1 case); and each had loss of the normal allele. Nine patients (24%) had small copy-number changes (< 10 Mb) including deletions of NF1, ETV6/TEL, CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Interestingly, mRNA microarray analysis showed a relationship between chromosomal changes and mRNA expression levels: loss or gain of chromosomes led, respectively, to either a decrease or increase of mRNA expression of genes in the region. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that at least one half of cases of normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome have readily identifiable genomic abnormalities, as found by our analysis; the high frequency of copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity is especially notable.","['Akagi, Tadayuki', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Yamamoto, Go', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Miller, Carl W', 'Yung, Amanda', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Akagi T', 'Ogawa S', 'Dugas M', 'Kawamata N', 'Yamamoto G', 'Nannya Y', 'Sanada M', 'Miller CW', 'Yung A', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. tadayuki@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA/analysis']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['haematol.13024 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13024 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Feb;94(2):213-23. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13024.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study of the outcomes of patients who were hepatitis C virus seropositive at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (N=31). Patients positive for hepatitis C virus were considered candidates for stem cell transplantation only if they had no significant evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Matched controls (N=31) were seronegative for viral hepatitides and were paired according to age, diagnosis, disease stage, conditioning regimen and donor type. We also compared the hepatitis C virus seropositive patients to all seronegative patients (all controls, N=1800) transplanted during the same period, to adjust for other confounding effects. RESULTS: The median age of the seropositive patients was 49 (range 26-72); 15 had acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 had chronic myeloid leukemia/myeloproliferative disease, 6 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 2 myeloma, 1 acute lymphocytic leukemia and 1 Hodgkin's lymphoma; 61% had poor risk disease; 68% had related donors; 68% received reduced intensity conditioning; 7 patients had mildly abnormal alanine transaminase levels (all less than three times the upper limit of normal) and 1 patient had minimally elevated bilirubin. These characteristics were similar to those of the matched control group. Median overall survival was 3, 18 and 20 months, and 1-year survival was 29%, 56% and 56%, in the hepatitis C virus, matched and all controls groups, respectively (hazard ratio for death 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.9-5.6, p<0.001 in multivariate analysis). Non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 43%, 24% and 23%, respectively (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-7.1, p<0.01). Disease progression and graft-versus-host disease rates were comparable.

The advent of imatinib increased survival significantly in patients in an advanced phase of the disease. However, few long-term data on the outcome of these patients based on large, prospective and controlled trials are available. DESIGN AND METHODS: A phase 2 multicenter trial of the use of imatinib 600 mg/daily in patients with accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia was sponsored and promoted by the Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in 2001. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients were enrolled; the median follow-up of the 41 living patients is 82 months (range, 73-87). One hundred and seven patients (96%) returned to chronic phase and 79 patients (71%) achieved a complete hematologic response. Cumulative best rates of major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response were 30% and 21%, respectively. All responses were maintained for a minimum of 4 weeks. At last follow-up, four patients were alive in complete remission after allogeneic transplant, 16 patients (14%) had switched to a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor and 21 patients (19%) were alive on imatinib therapy. No late toxicities were observed. Progression-free survival and event-free survival rates were 36.5% and 15%, respectively, at 7 years. The median survival time was 37 months, and was significantly associated with the achievement of a complete hematologic response or a complete cytogenetic response.

Their activation can lead to lymphokine production, cytolitic activity, antibody secretion, cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and phagocytosis. Anomalous ZAP-70 and Syk expression is reported to be related to tumor formation and progression, and ZAP-70 immunoreactivity is a good prognostic marker of disease progression in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Until now, to our knowledge, there are no reports about canine ZAP-70 and Syk expression profiles. In the present study, a RT-PCR procedure for the quali-quantitative evaluation of canine ZAP-70 and Syk transcripts was designed. The expression patterns of canine ZAP-70 and Syk mRNAs were evaluated in canine leukocyte subpopulations and in peripheral whole blood samples from healthy dogs and from dogs with different types of leukaemia. Similarly to humans, normal canine CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed high expression of ZAP-70, whereas Syk was abundantly expressed in normal CD21+ B cells. The expression profile of ZAP-70 and Syk was markedly different in canine normal and leukaemic blood. Decreased Syk expression was detected in dogs with T-cell CLL, whereas decreased ZAP-70 expression was detected in dogs with B-cell CLL and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). The comparison of ZAP-70 and Syk mRNA levels between normal and leukaemic peripheral whole blood showed that the expression ratio ZAP-70/Syk is subjected to modification depending on the leukaemia status of patients. The results of the present work open an interesting topic for leukaemogenesis investigation and are the basis for further studies for a proper evaluation of the potential utility of these parameters for the diagnosis and prognosis of canine T- and B-cell leukaemia.","['Mortarino, M', 'Gelain, M E', 'Gioia, G', 'Ciusani, E', 'Bazzocchi, C', 'Comazzi, S']","['Mortarino M', 'Gelain ME', 'Gioia G', 'Ciusani E', 'Bazzocchi C', 'Comazzi S']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Hygiene and Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dog Diseases/blood/*enzymology/immunology', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Gene Dosage', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia/blood/enzymology/immunology/*veterinary', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology/immunology', 'Plasmids/genetics/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Syk Kinase', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(08)00782-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2009 Apr 15;128(4):395-401. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.12.010.

One of the members of this family, CYP2B6, plays a very important role in metabolizing carcinogens and medications. CYP2B6G15631T gene polymorphism reduces CYP2B6 enzyme activity. In this study, we aimed to determine whether any association exists between genetic polymorphism in CYP2B6G15631T and individual susceptibility to acute leukemia. Our study group consisted of 80 acute leukemia patients and 100 unrelated healthy volunteers as a control group. 44 of the acute leukemia patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 36 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genomic DNA samples were assayed for restriction fragment length polymorphism in the CYP2B6 loci by PCR amplification followed by digestion with BsrI. The data were analyzed statistically employing chi-square and logistic regression analyses. The frequencies of GG genotype (wild type) were 40.9%, 50% and 67% in ALL, AML and control groups, respectively. The frequencies of polymorphic GT genotype (heterozygous variant) were found to be 59.1% in ALL patients, 50% in AML patients and 33% in controls. The TT genotype (homozygous variant) was not observed in either control or leukemia cases. Logistic regression analyses showed a significant correlation between the CYP2B6 G15631T polymorphism (GT) and acute leukemia patients (OR=2.481, 95% CI=1.353-4.551, p=0.003). Our findings indicate that GT genotype may be an important genetic determinant for acute leukemias.

To investigate the mechanism underlying this differentiation and the synergistic effect, a cDNA microarray and Northern blot analysis were used to examine gene expression profiles of ML-1 cells treated with TPA and/or KH1060. Results show that KH1060 enhanced several TPA-induced gene expressions and that TPA enhanced several KH1060-induced gene expressions. Studies with inhibitors of signaling molecules suggested that PKC and MAPK pathways play an important role in the differentiation induced by TPA and KH1060, and that they are associated with the synergistic induction of genes. The results of this study indicate the possibility that the expression of various genes are induced synergistically by cross-talk between TPA and KH1060 signals. It is likely that the synergistic effect on gene expression leads to the synergistic induction of differentiation by both reagents.","['Shimizu, Takahisa', 'Kuromi, Aya', 'Takeda, Ken']","['Shimizu T', 'Kuromi A', 'Takeda K']","['Department of Hygiene-Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda-shi, Chiba, Japan. takahisa@rs.noda.tus.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(08)00521-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Jun;33(6):803-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.020.

In the present study, we examined expression of CD203c on normal mast cells (MC)and bone marrow (bm) MC derived from 85 patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), including cases with indolent SM (ISM, n=72), SM with associated clonal hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD, n=6), aggressive SM (ASM, n=3), and mast cell leukemia (MCL, n=4). Surface expression of CD203c was analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. In patients with SM, bm MC expressed significantly higher amounts of CD203c compared to normal bm MC (median MFI in controls: 260 versus median MFI in SM: 516, p<0.05). Slightly lower amounts of CD203c were detected on MC in SM-AHNMD and ASM compared to ISM. To demonstrate CD203c expression in MC at the mRNA level, neoplastic MC were highly enriched by cell sorting, and were found to express CD203c mRNA in RT-PCR analysis. Cross-linking of the IgE receptor on MC resulted in a substantial upregulation of CD203c, whereas the KIT-ligand stem cell factor (SCF) showed no significant effects. In conclusion, CD203c is a novel activation-linked surface antigen on MC that is upregulated in response to IgE receptor cross-linking and is overexpressed on neoplastic MC in patients with SM.","['Hauswirth, A W', 'Escribano, L', 'Prados, A', 'Nunez, R', 'Mirkina, I', 'Kneidinger, M', 'Florian, S', 'Sonneck, K', 'Vales, A', 'Schernthaner, G-H', 'Sanchez-Munoz, L', 'Sperr, W R', 'Buhring, H-J', 'Orfao, A', 'Valent, P']","['Hauswirth AW', 'Escribano L', 'Prados A', 'Nunez R', 'Mirkina I', 'Kneidinger M', 'Florian S', 'Sonneck K', 'Vales A', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Sanchez-Munoz L', 'Sperr WR', 'Buhring HJ', 'Orfao A', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (ENPP3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mastocytosis/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/genetics/*immunology', 'Pyrophosphatases/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Up-Regulation']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['4 [pii]', '10.1177/039463200802100404 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2008 Oct-Dec;21(4):797-806. doi: 10.1177/039463200802100404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most women are not diagnosed until the disease has already metastasized from the ovaries with a resultant poor prognosis. Ovarian cancer is associated with an overall 5 year survival of little more than 50%. The mainstay of front-line therapy is cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy. Traditionally, this has been by the intravenous route only but there is more interest in the delivery of intraperitoneal chemotherapy utilizing the pharmaco-therapeutic advantage of the peritoneal barrier. Despite three large, randomized clinical trials comparing intravenous with intraperitoneal chemotherapy showing improved outcomes for those receiving at least part of their chemotherapy by the intraperitoneal route.Cisplatin has been the most active drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer for the last 4 decades and the prognosis for women with ovarian cancer can be defined by the tumor response to cisplatin. Those whose tumors are innately platinum-resistant at the time of initial treatment have a very poor prognosis. Although the majority of patients with ovarian cancer respond to front-line platinum combination chemotherapy the majority will develop disease that becomes resistant to cisplatin and will ultimately succumb to the disease.Improving the efficacy of cisplatin could have a major impact in the fight against this disease. Arsenite is an exciting agent that not only has inherent single-agent tumoricidal activity against ovarian cancer cell lines but also multiple biochemical interactions that may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin including inhibition of deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) repair. In vitro studies suggest that arsenite may enhance the activity of cisplatin in other cell types. Arsenic trioxide is already used clinically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia demonstrating its safety profile. Further research in ovarian cancer is warranted to define its possible role in this disease.","['Helm, C William', 'States, J Christopher']","['Helm CW', 'States JC']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Women's Health, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville KY 40292, USA. cwhelm@uoflobgyn.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Ovarian Res,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,,,,2009/01/16 09:00,2009/01/16 09:01,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/16 09:01 [medline]']","['1757-2215-2-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1757-2215-2-2 [doi]']",epublish,J Ovarian Res. 2009 Jan 14;2:2. doi: 10.1186/1757-2215-2-2.,10.1186/1757-2215-2-2 [doi],20090114,"['P30 ES014443/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES011314/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2636805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated whether consumed cured/smoked meat and fish, the major dietary resource for exposure to nitrites and nitrosamines, is associated with childhood acute leukemia. METHODS: A population-based case-control study of Han Chinese between 2 and 20 years old was conducted in southern Taiwan. 145 acute leukemia cases and 370 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited between 1997 and 2005. Dietary data were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models were used in data analyses. RESULTS: Consumption of cured/smoked meat and fish more than once a week was associated with an increased risk of acute leukemia (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.15-2.64). Conversely, higher intake of vegetables (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37-0.83) and bean-curd (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.89) was associated with a reduced risk. No statistically significant association was observed between leukemia risk and the consumption of pickled vegetables, fruits, and tea. CONCLUSION: Dietary exposure to cured/smoked meat and fish may be associated with leukemia risk through their contents of nitrites and nitrosamines among children and adolescents, and intake of vegetables and soy-bean curd may be protective.","['Liu, Chen-Yu', 'Hsu, Yi-Hsiang', 'Wu, Ming-Tsang', 'Pan, Pi-Chen', 'Ho, Chi-Kung', 'Su, Li', 'Xu, Xin', 'Li, Yi', 'Christiani, David C']","['Liu CY', 'Hsu YH', 'Wu MT', 'Pan PC', 'Ho CK', 'Su L', 'Xu X', 'Li Y', 'Christiani DC']","['Environmental and Occupational Medicine and Epidemiology Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. cliu@hsph.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', '*Diet', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Soy Foods', 'Vegetables', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-15 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Jan 13;9:15. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-15.,10.1186/1471-2407-9-15 [doi],20090113,"['ES00002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES09723/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2653540,,,,,,,['Kaohsiung Leukemia Research Group'],,,,,,"['Chang TT', 'Lin SF', 'Chiou SS', 'Jang RC', 'Hsiao HH', 'Liu TC', 'Lin PC', 'Hsiao CC', 'Sheen JM', 'Kuo CY', 'Wang MC', 'Huang CH', 'Huang CB', 'Wong YC', 'Wu HB', 'Lin SJ', 'Sun YM', 'Hsieh KS', 'Chang YH']","['Chang, Tai-Tsung', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung', 'Chiou, Shyh-Shin', 'Jang, Ren-Chin', 'Hsiao, Hui-Hua', 'Liu, Ta-Chih', 'Lin, Pei-Chin', 'Hsiao, Chih-Cheng', 'Sheen, Jiunn-Ming', 'Kuo, Ching-Yuan', 'Wang, Ming-Chung', 'Huang, Cheng-Hua', 'Huang, Chung-Bin', 'Wong, Yuk-Cheung', 'Wu, Hung-Bo', 'Lin, Shyh-Jer', 'Sun, Yu-Ming', 'Hsieh, Kai-Sheng', 'Chang, Yu-Hsiang']",,,,

Here we report the long-term results of the FRALLE 93 study conducted in the era before the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: Between 1993 and 1999, 36 children with Ph1-ALL were enrolled into the FRALLE 93 protocol. After conventional four-drug induction, children were stratified by availability of an HLA-matched sibling. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was observed in 26 children (72%), of which 13 underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Thirty-one children were good responders to prednisone, defined on day 8, and 21 were good responders to chemotherapy, defined by day-21 bone marrow (M1). Overall five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 42 +/- 9.7%. Based on multivariate analysis, two groups showed marked differences in five-year outcome: children with age<10, leukocyte count <100,000/mm3 and day-21 M1 marrow had a more favorable prognosis (14 pts: 100% CR, event free survival [EFS]: 57%, overall survival [OS]: 79%), than the high-risk group (22 patients: 55% CR, EFS: 18%, OS: 27%) (p < 0.005). We also observed a non statistically significant difference (p = 0.14) in outcome between these groups for transplanted patients (5-year DFS: 83 +/- 14% and 33 +/- 15%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Age, leukocyte count and early response to treatment defined by the D21 bone marrow response provide an accurate model for outcome prediction. The combination of available tools such as minimal residual disease assessment with determination of these simple factors could be useful for refining indications for BMT in the current era of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor-based therapy.","['Gandemer, Virginie', 'Auclerc, Marie-Francoise', 'Perel, Yves', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre', 'Le Gall, Edouard', 'Demeocq, Francois', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Piguet, Christophe', 'Stephan, Jean-Louis', 'Lejars, Odile', 'Debre, Marianne', 'Jonveaux, Philippe', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Gandemer V', 'Auclerc MF', 'Perel Y', 'Vannier JP', 'Le Gall E', 'Demeocq F', 'Schmitt C', 'Piguet C', 'Stephan JL', 'Lejars O', 'Debre M', 'Jonveaux P', 'Cayuela JM', 'Chevret S', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France. virginie.gandemer@chu-rennes.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'FRALLE 93 protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anthracyclines', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cortisone', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-14 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Jan 13;9:14. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-14.,10.1186/1471-2407-9-14 [doi],20090113,,PMC2629767,,,,,,,['FRALLE group'],,,,,,"['Pautard B', 'Bauduer JF', 'Abgrall JF', 'Berthou C', 'Paillard C', 'Kanold J', 'Couillault G', 'Damay M', 'de Lumley L', 'Michel G', 'Thuret I', 'Chambost H', 'Bordigoni P', 'Sommel D', 'Leblanc T', 'Schaison G', 'Tabone MD', 'Donadieu J', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Auvrignon A', 'Thomas C', 'Fisher A', 'Dommergues JP', 'Bader-Meunier B', 'Bernaudin F', 'Lemerle S', 'Choulot J', 'Doireau V', 'Edan C', 'Bergeron C', 'Schneider P', 'Lamagnere JP', 'Berger C', 'Cornu G', 'Vermylen C']","['Pautard, B', 'Bauduer, J F', 'Abgrall, J F', 'Berthou, C', 'Paillard, C', 'Kanold, J', 'Couillault, G', 'Damay, M', 'de Lumley, L', 'Michel, G', 'Thuret, I', 'Chambost, H', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Sommel, D', 'Leblanc, T', 'Schaison, G', 'Tabone, M D', 'Donadieu, J', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Auvrignon, A', 'Thomas, C', 'Fisher, A', 'Dommergues, J P', 'Bader-Meunier, B', 'Bernaudin, F', 'Lemerle, S', 'Choulot, J', 'Doireau, V', 'Edan, C', 'Bergeron, C', 'Schneider, P', 'Lamagnere, J P', 'Berger, C', 'Cornu, G', 'Vermylen, C']",,,,

The current review aimed to assess the frequency and clinical features of constrictive bronchiolitis occurring in patients with PAMS. METHODS: A computer-assisted search of medical records identified 17 patients with PAMS seen during the period 1994-2007. Medical records, radiological studies and biopsy results were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 10 men and 7 women; the median age at diagnosis of PAMS was 60 years (range 33-72 years). Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were the underlying neoplasms in over two-thirds of these patients. Constrictive bronchiolitis was diagnosed in three patients who had respiratory symptoms, severe airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing and evidence of air trapping on CT scanning with no other identifiable cause for these findings. In contrast to previous reports, two of the three patients with constrictive bronchiolitis presented with skin and respiratory manifestations in the absence of a known neoplasm. Seven patients with PAMS died (41%) after a median interval of 13 months (range 1-33 months) and the deaths included two of the constrictive bronchiolitis patients who continued to worsen despite immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a minority of patients with PAMS, constrictive bronchiolitis occurs and tends to cause progressive airflow obstruction that responds poorly to immunosuppressive therapy. Constrictive bronchiolitis in these patients may be manifest prior to the discovery of the underlying neoplasm and the diagnosis of PAMS.","['Maldonado, Fabien', 'Pittelkow, Mark R', 'Ryu, Jay H']","['Maldonado F', 'Pittelkow MR', 'Ryu JH']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Respirology,"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",9616368,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*complications', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Pemphigus/*complications', 'Treatment Failure']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['RES1397 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01397.x [doi]']",ppublish,Respirology. 2009 Jan;14(1):129-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01397.x.,10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01397.x [doi],,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a total of 92 normal buffalo embryos obtained by in vitro fertilization, 18 were morulae, 33 were blastocyst and 41 were hatched blastocyst, the inside of morulae or inner cell masses of blastocysts were isolated mechanically and cultured onto mitomocin-C-inactivated buffalo embryonic fibroblasts as feeder layers. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) of ES-like cells, as well as the specific stage embryonic antigen SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4 and transcription factor OCT-4, was used to evaluate the characterization of the cells. The spontaneous differentiation of ES-like cells was induced by culturing on leukaemia inhibitory factor-free medium for more than 2 weeks without passage. To evaluate mark gene expression, total RNA was extracted from cells, and specific primers were used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After 8-10 days of culture, primary ES-like cell colonies were formed in 0% (0/18) of morulae, 24.24% (8/33) of blastocysts and 60.98% (25/41) of hatched blastocysts, respectively. The forming rate of primary ES-like cells colonies in hatched blastocyst group was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the obtained for other groups. Two ES-like cell lines could survive to eight passages at least by using the method of mechanical dissociation, but just three passages by using the method of enzymatic dissociation. The cells formed large, multicellular colonies with distinct boundaries, exhibited many important features of ES/ES-like cells, including positive AP, SSEA-1, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 activity. Undifferentiated buffalo ES-like cells expressed Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2 gene mRNA.

The aims of the present study were to determine the frequency of leukaemia-associated phenotypes (LAP) in AML and to correlate their presence with response to induction chemotherapy. We analysed bone marrow samples at diagnosis from 84 AML patients using triple staining flow cytometry with routine standard panel of monoclonal antibodies. The association of LAP and response to induction chemotherapy was evaluated retrospectively. LAP were observed in 54 (64%) patients: lineage infidelity in 19 (35%), asynchronous antigen expression in 28 (52%), and lack of expected lineage specific antigens in 19 (35%). Significant correlation was found between LAP and responses to induction chemotherapy. Response to induction chemotherapy was more frequent in the absence of LAP (P < 0.05, estimated risk ratio of 1.6, 95%CI, 1.0-2.6) in a multivariate analysis. In conclusion, our data show the presence of LAP in AML is an independent predictor for response to induction chemotherapy and risk of relapse and should be considered for counselling patients and planning therapy.","['Al-Mawali, A', 'To, L B', 'Gillis, D', 'Hissaria, P', 'Mundy, J', 'Lewis, I']","['Al-Mawali A', 'To LB', 'Gillis D', 'Hissaria P', 'Mundy J', 'Lewis I']","['Divisions of Haematology and Human Immunology, Hanson Institute, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS), University of Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/03/14 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [medline]']","['CLH1003 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01003.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Feb;31(1):61-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01003.x.,10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01003.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cotransplantation of MSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from HLA-identical siblings has been shown to reduce the incidence of acute graft-vs.-host disease. MSCs are heterogeneous and data on the inhibitory effects of different MSC subsets are lacking. The antigen Stro1 is a marker for a pure primitive MSC subset. We investigated whether Stro-1-enriched induce a more significant suppressive effect on lymphocytes in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), and whether this action is related to a specific gene expression profile in Stro-1-enriched compared to other MSCs. We demonstrated that the Stro-1-enriched population elicits a significantly more profound dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in a MLR than MSCs. One thousand expanded Stro-1-enriched induced an inhibitory effect comparable to that of 10 times as many MSCs. Inhibition by Stro-1-enriched was more significant in contact-dependent cultures than in noncontact-dependant cultures at higher ratio. The Stro-1-enriched inhibitory effect in both culture types was linked to increased gene expression for soluble inhibitory factors such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), indoleamine oxidase (IDO), human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM1). However, tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta) and IL-10 were only up-regulated in contact-dependant cultures. These results may support using a purified Stro-1-enriched population to augment the suppressive effect in allogeneic transplantation.","['Nasef, A', 'Zhang, Y Z', 'Mazurier, C', 'Bouchet, S', 'Bensidhoum, M', 'Francois, S', 'Gorin, N C', 'Lopez, M', 'Thierry, D', 'Fouillard, L', 'Chapel, A']","['Nasef A', 'Zhang YZ', 'Mazurier C', 'Bouchet S', 'Bensidhoum M', 'Francois S', 'Gorin NC', 'Lopez M', 'Thierry D', 'Fouillard L', 'Chapel A']","['EA 1638 Laboratoire de Therapie Cellulaire et Radioprotection Accidentelle (LTCRA), Faculte de medecine Saint Antoine, Universite Paris VI, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (STRO-1 antigen, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/genetics/*pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Stromal Cells']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/03/14 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [medline]']","['CLH997 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00997.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Feb;31(1):9-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00997.x.,10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00997.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms for the linkage between the SMAD-dependent and -independent pathways are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether TGF-beta activates the ERK pathway and how TGFbeta communicates with the MAP kinase signals induced by a mitogen, in human myeloid leukaemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS AND RESULTS: TGFbeta dramatically suppressed proliferation of MV4-11 and TF-1 cells without detectable phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 for the duration of 48 h, as detected by MTT assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. In contrast, GM-CSF induced rapid and transient phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and up-regulated cell proliferation. Both GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation were significantly inhibited by TGFbeta. GM-CSF also induced transient phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Corresponding to this change, phosphorylated p85 was found to bind to the GM-CSF receptor-alpha subunit, as detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK, blocked GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK but not p85. However, TGFbeta and LY294002, a potent inhibitor of PI3-kinase, significantly inhibited phosphorylation of both p85 and ERK1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These studies thus indicate that TGFbeta does not activate the ERK pathway but turns off the GM-CSF-induced ERK signal via inhibition of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway, in these human leukaemia cells.","['Montenegro, D E', 'Franklin, T', 'Moscinski, L C', 'Zuckerman, K S', 'Hu, X-T']","['Montenegro DE', 'Franklin T', 'Moscinski LC', 'Zuckerman KS', 'Hu XT']","['School of Natural and Health Science, Barry University, Miami Shores, FL 33161, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/02/13 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [medline]']","['CPR567 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2008.00567.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2009 Feb;42(1):1-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2008.00567.x.,10.1111/j.1365-2184.2008.00567.x [doi],,"['R25 GM059244/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 G059244/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC3928791,,,,,['NIHMS554938'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hypotheses have been proposed: antigenic stimulation predicts positive associations between cancers and allergies (i.e., allergy sufferers are more likely to get cancer), whereas immunosurveillance and prophylaxis predict inverse associations (i.e., allergy sufferers are less likely to get cancer). Immunosurveillance predicts inverse associations for cancers of all tissues and organ systems, and prophylaxis predicts inverse associations specifically for cancers of tissues and organ systems that interface with the external environment. To comparatively evaluate these hypotheses, we comprehensively reviewed the literature on cancer and allergies. We located 148 papers published from 1955 through 2006 that reported results of 463 studies of relationships between patients' histories of 11 specific allergies and cancers of 19 tissues and organ systems, and 183 studies of patients' histories of multiple allergies in relation to various types/sites of cancers. Analyses of these studies revealed that (1) frequencies of positive, inverse, and null allergy-cancer associations differed considerably among cancers of different tissues and organ systems; (2) more than twice as many studies reported inverse allergy-cancer associations as reported positive associations; (3) inverse associations were particularly common for cancers of the mouth and throat, brain glia, colon and rectum, pancreas, skin, and cervix but (4) particularly rare for cancers of the breast, prostate, and brain meninges, and for myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and myelocytic leukemia; (5) lung cancer was positively associated with asthma but inversely associated with other allergies; (6) inverse associations with allergies were more than twice as common for cancers of nine tissues and organ systems that interface with the external environment compared to cancers of nine tissues and organ systems that do not interface with the external environment; and (7) eczema, hives, and allergies to animal dander and food were most frequently inversely associated with cancers of tissues that interface with the external environment. Taken together, these results are more consistent with the prophylaxis hypothesis than the two alternatives. IgE is a widespread and ancient immunoglobulin isotype in mammals, occurring among all known marsupials, monotremes, and eutherians. The IgE system and its associated allergy symptoms may serve a common protective function: the rapid expulsion of pathogens, dangerous natural toxins, and other carcinogenic antigens before they can trigger malignant neoplasia in exposed tissues.","['Sherman, Paul W', 'Holland, Erica', 'Sherman, Janet Shellman']","['Sherman PW', 'Holland E', 'Sherman JS']","['Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University Ithaca, New York 14853-2702, USA. pws6@cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Q Rev Biol,The Quarterly review of biology,0376515,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Models, Immunological', 'Neoplasms/complications/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Parasitic Diseases/complications/immunology']",2009/01/16 09:00,2009/02/21 09:00,['2009/01/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1086/592850 [doi]'],ppublish,Q Rev Biol. 2008 Dec;83(4):339-62. doi: 10.1086/592850.,,,,,,,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABCC4 (MRP4) and ABCC5 (MRP5) localize to different cellular sites and fulfill lineage-specific functions such as mediator storage in platelets' dense granules. All mature blood cells originate from the same precursor and specific functionalities arise during differentiation. To characterize this process, expression, localization and function of MRP4 and MRP5 were assessed in differentiating human CD34+ progenitors and leukemia cell lines using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence microscopy and cell viability assays. Median MRP4 mRNA copy numbers were significantly enhanced by megakaryocytic differentiation from 7.9 x 10(3) to 5.8 x 10(4) copies per nanograms of total RNA (p < 0.05) in CD34+ progenitors and in M-07e cells (MRP4 mRNA/18S rRNA ratios: 5.4 +/- 3.8 x 10(-4) vs. 2.7 +/- 0.9 x 10(-3) for native and differentiated cells, respectively, p < 0.05), and MRP4 protein was localized to granular structures and to the plasma membrane both in differentiated progenitors and bone marrow megakaryocytes. In contrast, expression of MRP4 decreased during maturation to leukocytes (MRP4 mRNA/18S rRNA ratios: 5.2 x 10(-3) for native vs. 3.5 x 10(-3) for CD34+ cells in the presence of G-CSF, p < 0.05) and was significantly reduced in mature monocytes and granulocytes compared with progenitors (MRP4 mRNA/18S rRNA ratios: 8.1 +/- 5.4 x 10(-5) and 2.8 +/- 1.6 x 10(-4) vs. 1.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(-3), respectively, p < 0.05). Expression of MRP5 was not significantly altered under all differentiation conditions. These results indicate that MRP4 expression is differentially regulated during hematopoiesis. The increase of MRP4 together with its specific localization during differentiation toward megakaryocytes supports the concept of platelet specific functions whereas decreased transporter expression in leukocyte differentiation may have implications for chemotherapy.","['Oevermann, Lena', 'Scheitz, Jan', 'Starke, Katharina', 'Kock, Kathleen', 'Kiefer, Thomas', 'Dolken, Gottfried', 'Niessen, Juliane', 'Greinacher, Andreas', 'Siegmund, Werner', 'Zygmunt, Marek', 'Kroemer, Heyo K', 'Jedlitschky, Gabriele', 'Ritter, Christoph A']","['Oevermann L', 'Scheitz J', 'Starke K', 'Kock K', 'Kiefer T', 'Dolken G', 'Niessen J', 'Greinacher A', 'Siegmund W', 'Zygmunt M', 'Kroemer HK', 'Jedlitschky G', 'Ritter CA']","['Department of Pharmacology, Research Center of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University, Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24207 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 May 15;124(10):2303-11. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24207.,10.1002/ijc.24207 [doi],,,,,['Int J Cancer. 2009 Sep 1;125(5):1241'],,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

Myeloablative conditioning regimens have been associated with high treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate in such patients, and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are often preferred but have high rates of disease recurrence and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). We report our experience with nine CML patients (four chronic phase and five with accelerated phase or blast crisis) who failed TKI and underwent allo-HSCT using an alemtuzumab-based RIC regimen. The conditioning regimen was well tolerated and induced engraftment in all patients, and complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) in eight of nine. Four patients, all with a history of accelerated phase or blast crisis, died. Four of the five remaining patients had a cytogenetic relapse a median of 10 months after transplantation. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), TKI or both induced a CCyR in all cases. With a median follow-up of 47 months, five patients, including all those transplanted in first or second chronic phase, are alive and in remission. Allo-HSCT with an alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen induces remission in patients with CML that have failed TKI therapy and has a low incidence of GVHD. Disease recurrence is frequent but responds to DLI. In some cases, restoration of susceptibility to TKI was observed. Outcomes may improve with the routine administration of post-transplant TKI.","['Poire, Xavier', 'Artz, Andrew', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Kline, Justin', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Rich, Elizabeth', 'Godley, Lucy', 'Stock, Wendy', 'van Besien, Koen']","['Poire X', 'Artz A', 'Larson RA', 'Kline J', 'Odenike O', 'Rich E', 'Godley L', 'Stock W', 'van Besien K']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and the Cancer Research Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/03/05 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [medline]']","['907774745 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802626624 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jan;50(1):85-91. doi: 10.1080/10428190802626624.,10.1080/10428190802626624 [doi],,['K24 CA116471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3617055,,,,,['NIHMS452872'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As life expectancy of these patients has increased with new and improved therapies, the morbidities associated with the treatments and the tumor itself have become more important. DISCUSSION: One of the most common morbidities is growth hormone deficiency, and since recombinant growth hormone (GH) became available, its use has increased exponentially. There is concern that in the population of children with brain tumors, GH treatment might increase the risk of tumor recurrence or progression or the appearance of a second neoplasm. In the light of this ongoing concern, the current literature has been reviewed to provide an update on the risk of tumor recurrence, tumor progression, or new intracranial tumor formation when GH is used to treat GH deficiency in children, who have had or have intracranial tumors. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this review, the authors conclude that the use of GH in patients with brain tumor is safe. GH therapy is not associated with an increased risk of central nervous system tumor progression or recurrence, leukemia (de novo or relapse), or extracranial non-leukemic neoplasms.","['Bogarin, Roberto', 'Steinbok, Paul']","['Bogarin R', 'Steinbok P']","[""Division of Endocrinology, Costa Rica's Children's Hospital, San Jose, Costa Rica.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Human Growth Hormone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00381-008-0790-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2009 Mar;25(3):273-9. doi: 10.1007/s00381-008-0790-6.

Moreover, he reported fever and fatigue. There were neither cardiovascular risk factors nor drug medication. 6 months earlier, a deep vein thrombosis of his left lower limb was diagnosed followed by an anticoagulation for 4 weeks. Physical examination revealed a dilatation of the neck veins with a present Kussmaul sign and a diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The findings on the rest of his physical examination were unremarkable. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm, low voltage, and anterolateral T wave inversion. Initial laboratory results were remarkable for elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a small pericardial effusion with a large intracardiac mass adjacent to the right atrium. Thoracic computed tomography confirmed the tumor mass and showed enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography-guided transvenous biopsy of the tumor. The immunohistology of the specimen revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient subsequently received a chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. His clinical response after the first cycle was remarkable with total regression of the superior vena cava syndrome. After the third cycle of therapy, both tumor and pericardial effusion had disappeared. CONCLUSION: A cardiac tumor is a rare cause of a superior vena cava syndrome. Tissue biopsy is warranted to guide diagnosis and therapy. Transvenous biopsy is generally safe when guided by echocardiography.","['Brueck, Martin', 'Bandorski, Dirk', 'Stahl, Ulrich', 'Kramer, Wilfried']","['Brueck M', 'Bandorski D', 'Stahl U', 'Kramer W']","['Medizinische Klinik I, Klinikum Wetzlar, Akademisches Lehrkrankenhaus der Universitat Giessen, Wetzlar, Germany.

Our results showed that BPSQ induced cytotoxicity whereas PPSQ was cytostatic. The cytotoxicity induced by BPSQ was concentration- and time-dependent. Cell cycle analysis and tritiated thymidine assay revealed that BPSQ affects the cell cycle progression by arresting at S phase. The absence of p-histone H3 and reduction in the levels of PCNA in the cells treated with BPSQ further confirmed the cell cycle arrest. Further, annexin V staining, DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation and changes in the expression levels of BCL2/BAD confirmed the activation of apoptosis. Activation of caspase 8 and lack of cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3 and PARP suggest the possibility of BPSQ triggering extrinsic pathway for induction of apoptosis, which is discussed. Hence, we have identified a novel compound which would have clinical relevance in cancer chemotherapeutics.","['Shahabuddin, M S', 'Nambiar, Mridula', 'Choudhary, Bibha', 'Advirao, Gopal M', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Shahabuddin MS', 'Nambiar M', 'Choudhary B', 'Advirao GM', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560 012, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Quinolines)', ""0 (butylamino-pyrimido(4',5'-4,5)selenolo(2,3-b)quinoline)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E66400VT9R (quinoline)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Quinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2009/01/15 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-008-9212-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2010 Feb;28(1):35-48. doi: 10.1007/s10637-008-9212-6.

We studied minimal residual disease (MRD) as a predictive factor for recurrence and as a decisional tool for postconsolidation maintenance (in MRD(neg)) or SCT (in MRD(pos)). MRD was tested at weeks 10, 16, and 22 using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with 1 or more sensitive probes. Only patients with t(9;22) or t(4;11) were immediately eligible for allogeneic SCT. Of 280 registered patients (236 in remission), 34 underwent an early SCT, 60 suffered from relapse or severe toxicity, and 142 were evaluable for MRD at the end of consolidation. Of these, 58 were MRD(neg), 54 MRD(pos), and 30 were not assessable. Five-year overall survival/disease-free survival rates were 0.75/0.72 in the MRD(neg) group compared with 0.33/0.14 in MRD(pos) (P = .001), regardless of the clinical risk class. MRD was the most significant risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio, 5.22).

It is unclear which cellular events drive BCR/ABL gene translocation or initiate leukemogenesis in CML. Bcl-2 promotes survival of hematopoietic stem cells. Accordingly, apoptosis-related pathway may involve in the leukemogenesis of CML. In the current study, we evaluated 80 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers involved in the pathways of apoptosis (n = 30), angiogenesis (n = 7), myeloid cell growth (n = 14), xenobiotic metabolism (n = 13), WT1 signaling (n = 7), interferon signaling (n = 4), and others (n = 5) in 170 CML patients and 182 healthy controls. In a single-marker analysis, the following SNPs were identified including VEGFA, BCL2, CASP7, JAK3, CSF3, and HOCT1. In the multivariate logistic model with these SNPs and covariates, only BCL2 (rs1801018) was significantly associated with the susceptibility to CML (P = .05; odds ratio [OR] 2.16 [1.00-4.68]). In haplotype analyses, haplotype block of BCL2 consistently showed significant association with the susceptibility to CML. Risk allele analysis showed that a greater number of risk alleles from BCL2 SNP correlated to increasing risk of CML (overall P = .1, OR 1.84 [1.06-3.22] for 3-4 risk alleles vs 0-1 risk alleles).

IFN-alpha has recently been recognized to harbor therapeutic potential in prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, HCC cells respond differentially to IFN treatment, the mechanism of which is largely unknown. To address this issue, we analyzed the effect of IFN-alpha on different liver tumor cell lines. We found that growth inhibiting effects of IFN-alpha in hepatoma cells require PML-NB induction and, moreover, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression on the mRNA and protein level. RNAi silencing of PML down-regulates TRAIL expression in hepatoma cells and correspondingly blocks IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis. In addition, PML-deficient primary hepatocytes fail to up-regulate TRAIL upon IFN-alpha-treatment in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. These data identify TRAIL as a novel downstream transcriptional target of PML-mediated apoptosis in hepatomas and suggest that PML and TRAIL play important roles in IFN-regulated apoptosis in HCC. Furthermore, the mechanism is independent of the p53 status of the tumor cells. In summary, our results identify central molecules mediating IFN-alpha induced apoptosis in liver tumors, shed light on the differential response of hepatoma cells to IFN exposure and, thus, may contribute to an efficient application of this substance in the treatment of liver cancer.","['Herzer, Kerstin', 'Hofmann, Thomas G', 'Teufel, Andreas', 'Schimanski, Christoph C', 'Moehler, Markus', 'Kanzler, Stephan', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Galle, Peter R']","['Herzer K', 'Hofmann TG', 'Teufel A', 'Schimanski CC', 'Moehler M', 'Kanzler S', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Galle PR']","['Department of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. herzer@uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2831 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2831 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;69(3):855-62. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2831.

Here, we use a mouse erythroleukemia cell (MEL) system for studying how repetitive DNA assumes or is assembled into different chromatin structures. We show that human gamma-satellite DNA arrays allow a transcriptionally permissive chromatin conformation in an adjacent transgene and efficiently protect it from epigenetic silencing. These arrays contain CTCF and Ikaros binding sites. In MEL cells, this gamma-satellite DNA activity depends on binding of Ikaros proteins involved in differentiation along the hematopoietic pathway. Given our discovery of gamma-satellite DNA in pericentromeric regions of most human chromosomes and a dynamic chromatin state of gamma-satellite arrays in their natural location, we suggest that gamma-satellite DNA represents a unique region of the functional centromere with a possible role in preventing heterochromatin spreading beyond the pericentromeric region.","['Kim, Jung-Hyun', 'Ebersole, Thomas', 'Kouprina, Natalay', 'Noskov, Vladimir N', 'Ohzeki, Jun-Ichirou', 'Masumoto, Hiroshi', 'Mravinac, Brankica', 'Sullivan, Beth A', 'Pavlicek, Adam', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Pack, Svetlana D', 'Kwon, Yoo-Wook', 'Flanagan, Patrick T', 'Loukinov, Dmitri', 'Lobanenkov, Victor', 'Larionov, Vladimir']","['Kim JH', 'Ebersole T', 'Kouprina N', 'Noskov VN', 'Ohzeki J', 'Masumoto H', 'Mravinac B', 'Sullivan BA', 'Pavlicek A', 'Dovat S', 'Pack SD', 'Kwon YW', 'Flanagan PT', 'Loukinov D', 'Lobanenkov V', 'Larionov V']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Ctcf protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Centromere/genetics', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phylogeny', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']","['gr.086496.108 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.086496.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2009 Apr;19(4):533-44. doi: 10.1101/gr.086496.108.

Arsenic is known to be one of the most toxic metalloids naturally occurring in the environment giving rise to severe toxic manifestations including cancer. Because arsenic is also used in chemotherapy of leukemia, it was considered worthwhile to concentrate on the mechanism of toxic action in normal hepatocytes which has not been addressed earlier. Rat hepatocytes were isolated and incubated in As(2)O(3) at concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 microM in a time-dependent manner (0, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, and 4 h). The expression of the common stress proteins HSP 70 and 90 throughout the experimental duration confirmed the magnitude of toxic effect imposed by arsenic. Microscopic observations showed clear apoptotic changes in hepatocytes, which were further characterized by DNA ladder formation in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Apoptosis was triggered by caspase activation and over expression of bax at 10 microM As(2)O(3) and at 20 and 40 microM concentrations of As(2)O(3), MAP kinases were found to mediate the apoptotic pathway. Co-treatment of cells with arsenic and caspase inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-Cho) led to over expression of bcl-2, suppression of bax, and cytosolic sequestration of Bid and Bad. It is therefore concluded that caspase activation has a direct role in arsenic-induced apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial factors at 10 microM As(2)O(3), and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 activation are the major mediators of apoptosis at the higher test concentrations (20 and 40 microM) of As(2)O(3).","['Ray, A', 'Roy, S', 'Agarwal, S', 'Bhattacharya, S']","['Ray A', 'Roy S', 'Agarwal S', 'Bhattacharya S']","['Department of Zoology, Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Densitometry', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/05/01 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [medline]']","['24/10/643 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233708100370 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2008 Nov;24(10):643-53. doi: 10.1177/0748233708100370.,10.1177/0748233708100370 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of the serious possibility that the link is indeed causal, a study of possible joint effects (interactions) of magnetic fields and genetic cofactors on childhood leukaemia may be justifiable. Such a study would face serious obstacles of limited numbers for subgroup analysis. To address these obstacles, we describe a design and analysis strategy that combines multiphase (multistage) sampling, measurement error modelling, and Bayesian methods for subgroup analysis that incorporate information from earlier pooled analyses. Special attention is given to prior specification, which would be the potentially controversial element. The approach could be pilot tested on data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, but an informative study would require augmenting these data with case-control sampling.

Recent studies proposed HLA-G as novel prognostic marker for patients with B-CLL. HLA-G was showed to bear even better prognostic information compared to Zeta-chain associated protein of 70kDa (ZAP-70) and CD38 although some other authors did not find HLA-G expression in CLL. Therefore in this study we characterized the expression of HLA-G on both RNA and protein level. In most of 20 B-CLL patients we were able to detect signal from HLA-G using flow cytometry analysis. The expression of HLA-G was confirmed on messenger level by real-time RT-PCR experiments. No correlation between HLA-G expression and expression of well established prognostic factors such as ZAP-70 and CD38 was detected. These results confirm that HLA-G is expressed on CLL leukemic cells.

Furthermore, using the Poisson function, Bayes theorem can provide the probabilities of specific categories of refractory anemia, given a number of observed blasts in a specific total of cells evaluated.

K-strain, which belongs to the Beijing family, is the most frequently isolated clinical strain of M. tuberculosis in Korea. In this study, we investigated the differential induction of cell death in human monocytic THP-1 cells by K-strain and H37Rv, a virulent but laboratory-adapted strain of M. tuberculosis. Although no significant difference in growth rate was observed between the cells exposed to K-strain and those exposed to H37Rv, the levels of protective cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12p40 were lower in K-strain-infected cells than in H37Rv-infected cells. Cell viability assays showed that both K-strain and H37Rv, but not heat- or streptomycin-killed bacteria, induced THP-1 cell death in a TNF-independent manner. In contrast, double staining with fluorochrome-labelled inhibitors of caspase and propidium iodide and lactate dehydrogenase release assays revealed that K-strain induced significantly higher levels of necrotic cell death, rather than apoptosis, in THP-1 cells than did H37Rv. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bfl-1 and Bcl-xL in the cells were significantly upregulated following infection with K-strain compared with H37Rv, whereas Bax was slightly upregulated in response to infection with both H37Rv and K-strain. These results suggest that the highly virulent K-strain keeps cellular apoptosis as a host defense mechanism to a minimum and induces necrosis in macrophages.","['Sohn, H', 'Lee, K-S', 'Kim, S-Y', 'Shin, D-M', 'Shin, S-J', 'Jo, E-K', 'Park, J-K', 'Kim, H-J']","['Sohn H', 'Lee KS', 'Kim SY', 'Shin DM', 'Shin SJ', 'Jo EK', 'Park JK', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L15 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Macrophages/*immunology/microbiology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*pathogenicity', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tuberculosis/*immunology/microbiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virulence', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/03/13 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [medline]']","['SJI2188 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2008.02188.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2009 Jan;69(1):43-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2008.02188.x.,10.1111/j.1365-3083.2008.02188.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most human cells deficiency of L-asparagine can be compensated by alternative synthesis pathway through which L-asparagine is produced from aspartic acid and glutamine by asparagine synthethase. Depletion of L-asparagine from plasma by L-asparaginase results in inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis with the subsequent blastic cell apoptosis. Owing to the unique anti-cancer mechanism of action, L-asparaginase has been introduced to the multi drug chemotherapy in children and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which has contributed to significant improvement of therapy outcomes and to achieve complete remission in about 90% of patients. Notwithstanding its high therapeutic efficacy, L-asparaginase can increase the risk of thrombosis. Inhibition of protein synthesis causes most complications observed during treatment with a native and pegylated form of L-asparaginase, including impaired functions of liver, kidneys or central nervous system. Thrombotic events occur as a result of inhibited synthesis of anticoagulant proteins (mainly antithrombin). Coagulopathy has been observed in 1.1-4% of patients treated with the pegylated L-asparaginase and in 2.1-15% of those receiving its native form.

In recent years, the number of transplants reported annually to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Registry is approximately 23,500 including 38% of allogeneic and 62% of autologous procedures. In most developed countries, the incidence of hematopoietic cell transplantations reaches 400/10 million inhabitants per year and 220/10 million per year in Poland. Further advances require both increased funding and improved public health system as a whole. To recommend transplantation, it is necessary to compare the risk associated with the disease itself versus that of the transplantation procedure which depends on the stage of the disease, patient's age, time interval from diagnosis to transplantation, donor type (siblings or unrelated subjects), sex of the donor and individual features. According to the EBMT recommendations, the following categories of indications have been used: ""standard procedure"" category--S, ""clinical option""--CO, indication of ""developmental"" character--D and ""generally not recommended""--NR. The tabular presentation of indications is an approximation since approach to each patient should be individualized. Generally, the most-common indications for auto-transplant treatment are myeloma, malignant lymphoma and acute myeloblastic leukemia while the main indication for bone marrow allotransplantation is acute myeloblastic leukemia (33% of all allotransplantations), lymphoblastic leukemia, dysmyelopoietic syndrome, chronic myeloblastic leukemia refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, then lymphoid malignancies and non-malignant disorders (bone marrow aplasia, severe immunodeficiencies, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, etc.).","['Holowiecki, Jerzy']",['Holowiecki J'],"['Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute, Branch Gliwice, Poland. holow@sum.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/02/13 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2008 Nov;118(11):658-63.,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fundoscopy showed leukaemic deposits on the retina. Other causes of blindness and deafness, e.g. trauma and foreign body in the ear respectively, were excluded. CONCLUSION: While the complications due to hyperleucocytosis-induced stasis recover following the conventional treatment, those due to other pathogenetic mechanisms such as leukaemic deposits do not return to their pre-morbid states following disease control despite the use of the currently available treatment protocols. For future research, more still needs to be done to elicit other uncommon pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these complications with a view to finding specific treatment measures for worrisome chronic myeloid leukaemia-related sensori-neural deficits.","['Joseph, D E', 'Durosinmi, M A']","['Joseph DE', 'Durosinmi MA']","['Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria. emmjos@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Niger J Clin Pract,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,101150032,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2009/01/15 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2009/01/15 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Niger J Clin Pract. 2008 Sep;11(3):246-9.,,,,,,"['Niger J Clin Pract. 2009 Mar;12(1):112.

Recent studies suggest broad and selective antitumor activity of the new iron chelator, di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT; Whitnall et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2006;103:14901-14906). However, little is known concerning its effects on hematological malignancies. Using acute leukemia cells, the effect of Dp44mT on apoptosis, cell cycle, caspase-3 activation, and mitochondrial trans-membrane potential has been examined by flow cytometry. Dp44mT acted to induce a G(1)/S arrest in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells at low concentrations (0.5-2.5 microM), being far more effective than the clinically used chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO). Moreover, Dp44mT induced apoptosis of NB4 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with markedly less effect on nonproliferating cells. The apoptosis-inducing activity of Dp44mT was significantly more effective than DFO. Furthermore, this study also showed that Dp44mT had broad activity, inducing apoptosis in several types of acute leukemia and also multiple myeloma cell lines. Additional studies examining the cytotoxic mechanisms of Dp44mT showed that a reduction in the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential and caspase-3 activation could be involved in the mechanism of apoptosis. Our results suggest that Dp44mT possesses potential as an effective cytotoxic agent for the chemotherapeutic treatment of acute leukemia.","['Noulsri, Egarit', 'Richardson, Des R', 'Lerdwana, Surada', 'Fucharoen, Suthat', 'Yamagishi, Tetsuo', 'Kalinowski, Danuta S', 'Pattanapanyasat, Kovit']","['Noulsri E', 'Richardson DR', 'Lerdwana S', 'Fucharoen S', 'Yamagishi T', 'Kalinowski DS', 'Pattanapanyasat K']","['Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '0 (di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Thiosemicarbazones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/14 09:00,2009/03/27 09:00,['2009/01/14 09:00'],"['2009/01/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21350 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2009 Mar;84(3):170-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21350.,10.1002/ajh.21350 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we evaluated the ability of PEGFIL to mobilize stem cells in 38 consecutive patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (multiple myeloma, n = 18; lymphomas, n = 15; chronic lymphocytic leukemia, n = 5). Patients were mobilized using PEGFIL (6-18 mg as a single dose) during 2005-2006; 32 then received high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. PEGFIL-mobilized patients were matched by age, disease, and treatment line at a ratio of 1:2 to historical FIL-mobilized controls. The primary study endpoint was the blood CD34(+) concentration at onset of leukapheresis. Leukapheresis began a median of 10 days from the beginning of mobilization chemotherapy in both groups. At the onset of leukapheresis, median blood CD34(+) cell counts did not differ significantly in the FIL group compared with the PEGFIL group (79 x 10(6)/L vs 64 x 10(6)/L, respectively; p = 0.44). In the different disease categories, the respective CD34(+) cell counts after FIL and PEGFIL mobilization were 72 x 10(6)/L vs 123 x 10(6)/L (p = 0.08) in myeloma, 51 x 10(6)/L vs 62 x 10(6)/L (p = 0.6) in lymphomas, and 27 x 10(6)/L vs 30 x 10(6)/L (p = 0.62) in CLL, respectively. The target CD34(+) cell yield was harvested with one leukapheresis in 53% of PEGFIL-mobilized patients. Engraftment after autografting did not differ significantly in the two groups. Stem cell mobilization with a single dose of PEGFIL was, therefore, comparable to that achieved using daily FIL in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases.

This study aims to examine the anti-leukemic activity of casticin on leukemia cells and its molecular mechanism. Cell viability was measured by MTT method; apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were determined by flow cytometry, AV-PI assay, and DNA fragmentation assay. Western blot were performed to measure the protein expression level. The cell morphology alteration was detected with immunofluorescent analysis and DAPI nuclear staining. Our results showed that the proliferation of leukemia cells, including K562, Kasumi-1, and HL-60, were inhibited by casticin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC50, determined after 48 h incubation, was 5.95 microM, 4.82 microM, and 15.56 microM for K562, HL-60, and Kasumi-1, respectively. The cell cycle analysis demonstrated casticin treatment resulted in a significant G2/M accumulation, concomitant with upregulation of P21waf1 and P27kip1. The percentage of cells in G2/M increased with time of exposure and reached to its climax (75.3%) at 12 h after casticin treatment, and subsequently declined to 27% at 48 h. We found that casticin treatment induced remarkable apoptosis, evidenced by increased percentage of AV-positive PI-negative cells as well as the cleavage of PARP and caspase 3. In addition, DNA fragmentation assay showed the typical apoptotic DNA ladder in casticin-treated K562 cells. Mitotic catastrophe and decreased polymeric tubulin can also be observed in casticin-treated K562 cells. In addition, we found that PI3K/AKT pathway was activated; Ly294002, a PI3K/AKT specific inhibitor, can enhance the anti-leukemic effect of casticin. Taken together, these results demonstrated that casticin induced leukemic cell death via apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe, and could synergize with PI3K/AKT inhibitor, suggesting that casticin could be a promising therapeutic agent against leukemia.","['Shen, Jia-Kun', 'Du, Hua-Ping', 'Yang, Min', 'Wang, Yun-Gui', 'Jin, Jie']","['Shen JK', 'Du HP', 'Yang M', 'Wang YG', 'Jin J']","[""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '753GT729OU (casticin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism']",2009/01/14 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/01/14 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0677-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Aug;88(8):743-52. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0677-3.

Tumor-associated Ags (TAA), for instance WT1 and proteinase-3, have been proposed as targets for T cells to establish a GVL effect. Here, we examined an additional TAA (MUC1) as a possible T-cell target of GVL-related immune responses. We have defined new peptide epitopes from the MUC1 Ag to broaden patients' screening and to expand the repertoire of immunologic monitoring as well as for therapeutic approaches in the future. Twenty-eight patients after allo-SCT have been screened for T-cell responses toward TAA (proteinase-3, WT1, MUC1). We could detect a significant relationship between relapse and the absence of a TAA-specific T-cell response, whereby only 2/13 (15%) patients with TAA-specific CTL relapsed, in contrast to 9/15 (60%) patients without TAA-specific CTL responses (P<0.05).

Here, we studied the ability of JAK1 V658F and A634D to activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway upon ectopic expression in HEK293 cells alone or together with the other components of the interleukin-9 receptor complex (IL-9Ralpha, gammac, and JAK3). Expression of JAK1 mutants alone failed to trigger STAT activation, but co-expression of the IL-9Ralpha chain promoted JAK1 mutant phosphorylation and STAT activation. Mutation of the FERM domain of JAK1, which is critical for cytokine receptor association, or of the single tyrosine of IL-9Ralpha involved in STAT recruitment abolished this activity, indicating that JAK1 mutants need to associate with a functional IL-9Ralpha to activate STAT factors. Several lines of evidence indicated that IL-9Ralpha homodimerization was involved in this process. IL-9Ralpha variants with mutations of the JAK-interacting BOX1 region not only failed to promote JAK1 activation but also acted as dominant negative forms reverting the effect of wild-type IL-9Ralpha. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also showed the formation of IL-9Ralpha homodimers. Interestingly, STAT activation was partially inhibited by expression of gammac, suggesting that overlapping residues are involved in IL-9Ralpha homodimerization and IL-9Ralpha/gammac heterodimerization. Co-expression of wild-type JAK3 partially reverted the inhibition by gammac, indicating that JAK3 cooperates with JAK1 mutants within the IL-9 receptor complex. Similar results were observed with IL-2Rbeta. Taken together, our results show that IL-9Ralpha and IL-2Rbeta homodimers efficiently mediate constitutive activation of ALL-associated JAK1 mutants.","['Hornakova, Tekla', 'Staerk, Judith', 'Royer, Yohan', 'Flex, Elisabetta', 'Tartaglia, Marco', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Knoops, Laurent', 'Renauld, Jean-Christophe']","['Hornakova T', 'Staerk J', 'Royer Y', 'Flex E', 'Tartaglia M', 'Constantinescu SN', 'Knoops L', 'Renauld JC']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels Branch and de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (IL2RB protein, human)', '0 (IL9R protein, human)', '0 (Il2rb protein, mouse)', '0 (Il9r protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-9)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-9/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2009/01/14 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/14 09:00'],"['2009/01/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32558-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M807531200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 13;284(11):6773-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M807531200.

H60-specific memory CD8 T cells generated during a helped primary response vigorously expanded only when rechallenged under helped conditions. The help requirement for an optimal secondary response was confirmed by a reduction in peak size by CD4 depletion, and was reproduced after skin transplantation. Helpless conditions or noncognate separate help during the secondary response resulted in a significant reduction in the peak size and different response kinetics. Providing CD4 help again during a tertiary challenge restored robust memory expansion; however, the repeated deprivation of help further reduced clonal expansion. Adoptively transferred memory CD8 T cells did not proliferate in CD40L(-/-) hosts. In the CD40(-/-) hosts, marginal memory expansion was detected after priming with male H60 cells but was completely abolished by priming with peptide-loaded CD40(-/-) cells, suggesting the essential role of CD40 and CD40L in memory responses.

We aimed to use a genome-wide study to improve prognostic classification of ALL in children. METHODS: We constructed a classifier based on gene expression in 190 children with newly diagnosed ALL (German Cooperative ALL [COALL] discovery cohort) by use of double-loop cross-validation and validated this in an independent cohort of 107 newly diagnosed patients (Dutch Childhood Oncology Group [DCOG] independent validation cohort). Hierarchical cluster analysis with classifying gene-probe sets revealed a new ALL subtype, the underlying genetic abnormalities of which were characterised by comparative genomic hybridisation-arrays and molecular cytogenetics. FINDINGS: Our classifier predicted ALL subtype with a median accuracy of 90.0% (IQR 88.3-91.7) in the discovery cohort and correctly identified 94 of 107 patients (accuracy 87.9%) in the independent validation cohort. Without our classifier, 44 children in the COALL cohort and 33 children in the DCOG cohort would have been classified as B-other. However, hierarchical clustering showed that many of these genetically unclassified cases clustered with BCR-ABL1-positive cases: 30 (19%) of 154 children with precursor B-ALL in the COALL cohort and 14 (15%) of 92 children with precursor B-ALL in the DCOG cohort had this BCR-ABL1-like disease. In the COALL cohort, these patients had unfavourable outcome (5-year disease-free survival 59.5%, 95% CI 37.1-81.9) compared with patients with other precursor B-ALL (84.4%, 76.8-92.1%; p=0.012), a prognosis similar to that of patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL (51.9%, 23.1-80.6%). In the DCOG cohort, the prognosis of BCR-ABL1-like disease (57.1%, 31.2-83.1%) was worse than that of other precursor B-ALL (79.2%, 70.2-88.3%; p=0.026), and similar to that of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL (32.5%, 2.3-62.7%). 36 (82%) of the patients with BCR-ABL1-like disease had deletions in genes involved in B-cell development, including IKZF1, TCF3, EBF1, PAX5, and VPREB1; only nine (36%) of 25 patients with B-other ALL had deletions in these genes (p=0.0002). Compared with other precursor B-ALL cells, BCR-ABL1-like cells were 73 times more resistant to L-asparaginase (p=0.001) and 1.6 times more resistant to daunorubicin (p=0.017), but toxicity of prednisolone and vincristine did not differ. INTERPRETATION: New treatment strategies are needed to improve outcome for this newly identified high-risk subtype of ALL.

Recently, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have been found to act as cellular targets for antiviral drugs. However, the pharmacological effects of CDK inhibitors on glial cell function in herpes simplex encephalitis have not been elucidated. The aim of this work was to determine the influence of olomoucine on microglial activation during the inflammatory response after herpes simplex virus 1(HSV-1) infection. METHODS: Microglial cells were treated with various concentrations of olomoucine after HSV-1 infection. The expression change of cyclin D1 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) in microglia were detected by Western blot analysis. Flow cytometry was used to assess the apoptosis ratio of microglial cells among the groups of control, HSV-1 infected and olomoucine treated with or without zVAD-fmk. ELISA was adopted to analyse cytokines in the supernatant. We used semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect HSV glycoprotein D gene. RESULTS: The following are the results of this work: (1) olomoucine reduced HSV-1-induced proliferation associated cyclin D1 expression; (2) olomoucine also induced microglial cells apoptosis early at 24 hours post-infection and inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; and (3) olomoucine-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent, and it also reduced the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. DISCUSSION: Our conclusion is that microglial cells are targets for olomoucine and that modulation of glial response and inflammation may be an appendant mechanism of CDK inhibitor-mediated neuroprotection in HSV-1 encephalitis.","['Zhou, Yu', 'Guo, Yuan-Jin', 'Liu, Xuan', 'Mei, Yuan-Wu']","['Zhou Y', 'Guo YJ', 'Liu X', 'Mei YW']","['Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. zhouyu131@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Neurol Res,Neurological research,7905298,"['0 (Ccl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '6A839B2HYS (olomoucine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'P39Y9652YJ (Kinetin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Encephalitis/*drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Encephalitis, Herpes Simplex/*drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/immunology', 'Kinetin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microglia/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/01/14 09:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/01/14 09:00'],"['2009/01/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ner1713 [pii]', '10.1179/174313209X383222 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurol Res. 2009 Nov;31(9):910-6. doi: 10.1179/174313209X383222.

The primary noncarcinogenic effects seen were lymphopenia, atrophy and fibrosis of the thoracic lymph nodes, and radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Radiation pneumonitis/ pulmonary fibrosis occurred from 105 days to more than 11 years after exposure, with the lowest associated alpha-particle dose being 5.9 Gy. The primary carcinogenic effects also occurred almost exclusively in the lung because of the short range of the alpha-particle emissions. The earliest lung cancer was observed at 1086 days after the inhalation exposure. The most common type seen was papillary adenocarcinoma followed by bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. These lung cancer results indicate that a more uniform distribution of alpha-particle dose within the lung has an equal or possibly greater risk of neoplasia than less uniform distributions of alpha-particle dose. The results are consistent with a linear relationship between dose and response, but these data do not directly address the response expected at low dose levels. No primary tumors were found in the tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes despite the high alpha-particle radiation doses to these lymph nodes, and no cases of leukemia were observed.","['Muggenburg, Bruce A', 'Guilmette, Raymond A', 'Hahn, Fletcher F', 'Diel, Joseph H', 'Mauderly, Joe L', 'Seilkop, Steven K', 'Boecker, Bruce B']","['Muggenburg BA', 'Guilmette RA', 'Hahn FF', 'Diel JH', 'Mauderly JL', 'Seilkop SK', 'Boecker BB']","['Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM 87108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['12059-95-9 (plutonium dioxide)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Hematology', '*Inhalation Exposure', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Male', 'Particle Size', 'Plutonium/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Pneumonitis/etiology', 'Radiometry', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tissue Distribution']",2009/01/14 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2009/01/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]']","['RR1409 [pii]', '10.1667/RR1409.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2008 Dec;170(6):736-57. doi: 10.1667/RR1409.1.,10.1667/RR1409.1 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation risks.,711-20,"Leukemia is one of the cancers most susceptible to induction by ionizing radiation, but the effects of lower doses delivered over time have not been quantified adequately. After the Chornobyl (Chernobyl) accident in Ukraine in April 1986, several hundred thousand workers who were involved in cleaning up the site and its surroundings received fractionated exposure, primarily from external gamma radiation. To increase our understanding of the role of protracted low-dose radiation exposure in the etiology of leukemia, we conducted a nested case-control study of leukemia in a cohort of cleanup workers identified from the Chornobyl State Registry of Ukraine. The analysis is based on 71 cases of histologically confirmed leukemia diagnosed in 1986-2000 and 501 age- and residence-matched controls selected from the same cohort. Study subjects or their proxies were interviewed about their cleanup activities and other relevant factors. Individual bone marrow radiation doses were estimated by the RADRUE dose reconstruction method (mean dose = 76.4 mGy, SD = 213.4). We used conditional logistic regression to estimate leukemia risks. The excess relative risk (ERR) of total leukemia was 3.44 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-9.78, P < 0.01]. The dose response was linear and did not differ significantly by calendar period of first work in the 30-km Chornobyl zone, duration or type of work. We found a similar dose-response relationship for chronic and non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ERR = 4.09 per Gy (95% CI < 0-14.41) and 2.73 per Gy (95% CI < 0-13.50), respectively].

In the framework of an epidemiological study of leukemia and other related blood diseases among Ukrainian cleanup workers, individual bone marrow doses have been estimated for 572 cases and controls. Because dose records were available for only about half of the study subjects, a time-and-motion method of dose reconstruction that would be applicable to all study subjects, whether dead or alive, was developed. The doses were calculated in a stochastic mode, thus providing estimates of uncertainties. The arithmetic mean individual bone marrow doses were found to range from 0.00004 to 3,300 mGy, with an average value of 87 mGy over the 572 study subjects. The uncertainties, characterized by the geometric standard deviation of the probability distribution of the individual dose, varied from subject to subject and had a median value of about 2.

The study was nested within cohorts of liquidators who had worked around the Chernobyl plant in 1986-1987. A total of 117 cases [69 leukemia, 34 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 14 other malignancies of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue] and 481 matched controls were included in the study. Individual dose to the bone marrow and uncertainties were estimated for each subject. The main analyses were restricted to 70 cases (40 leukemia, 20 NHL and 10 other) and their 287 matched controls with reliable information on work in the Chernobyl area. Most subjects received very low doses (median 13 mGy). For all diagnoses combined, a significantly elevated OR was seen at doses of 200 mGy and above. The excess relative risk (ERR) per 100 mGy was 0.60 [90% confidence interval (CI) -0.02, 2.35].

Thrombocytopenia was refractory to apheresis platelets; and gastrointestinal bleeding could be controlled only after the administration of a single dose (35 microg/kg, total dose 2.4 mg) of rFVIIa.

A subset of BCL family members capable of inhibiting cell death is known to contribute to tumorigenesis; however, it is not known whether all six antiapoptotic BCL family members play a causal role in tumor development. Using a mouse model of MYC-driven leukemia, we showed that, in addition to the well characterized BCL2 and BCLxl (BCL2L1), the other four family members -- BCLw (BCL2L2), BCLb (BCL2L10), BFL1 (BCL2A1) and MCL1 -- also cooperate with MYC to accelerate leukemogenesis.

Notably, in Pml(-/-) cortices, the overall number of proliferating NPCs was increased and transition between the two major progenitor types, radial glial cells and basal progenitors, was impaired. This in turn resulted in reduced differentiation and an overall decrease in the thickness of the cortex wall. In NPCs, Pml regulated the subcellular distribution of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the protein phosphatase 1alpha, triggering pRb dephosphorylation.

GMK is also responsible for the activation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a drug widely used as chemotherapeutic agent to treat leukemia. Several mechanisms of resistance to 6-TG have been reported but a subset of drug resistant cells cannot be explained by these mechanisms. We propose that mutations in GMK could result in drug resistance. Because cells require the presence of a functional GMK for viability, mutations that arise that lead to 6-TG resistance must retain activity toward GMP. We report three amino acid substitutions at serine 37 (S37) in mouse GMK that display activity toward GMP by conferring genetic complementation to a conditional GMK-deficient Escherichia coli and in enzyme assays. When 6-TG is included in complementation studies, cells expressing wild-type GMK are sensitive whereas all S37 mutants examined are able to effectively discriminate against 6-TG and display a drug resistance phenotype. Activity of the three S37 mutant enzymes toward clinically relevant concentrations of 6-TGMP is undetectable. Mutations in GMK, therefore, represent a previously undescribed mechanism for 6-TG resistance.","['Ardiani, Andressa', 'Goyke, Amanda', 'Black, Margaret E']","['Ardiani A', 'Goyke A', 'Black ME']","['School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, PO Box 646534, Pullman,WA 99164-6534, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Protein Eng Des Sel,"Protein engineering, design & selection : PEDS",101186484,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (Guanylate Kinases)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Guanylate Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['gzn078 [pii]', '10.1093/protein/gzn078 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Eng Des Sel. 2009 Apr;22(4):225-32. doi: 10.1093/protein/gzn078.

Here we show that Mkl1 expression is up-regulated during murine megakaryocytic differentiation and that enforced overexpression of MKL1 enhances megakaryocytic differentiation. When the human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line is induced to differentiate with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, overexpression of MKL1 results in an increased number of megakaryocytes with a concurrent increase in ploidy. MKL1 overexpression also promotes megakaryocytic differentiation of primary human CD34(+) cells cultured in the presence of thrombopoietin. The effect of MKL1 is abrogated when SRF is knocked down, suggesting that MKL1 acts through SRF. Consistent with these findings in human cells, knockout of Mkl1 in mice leads to reduced platelet counts in peripheral blood, and reduced ploidy in bone marrow megakaryocytes. In conclusion, MKL1 promotes physiologic maturation of human and murine megakaryocytes.","['Cheng, Ee-Chun', 'Luo, Qing', 'Bruscia, Emanuela M', 'Renda, Matthew J', 'Troy, James A', 'Massaro, Stephanie A', 'Tuck, David', 'Schulz, Vincent', 'Mane, Shrikant M', 'Berliner, Nancy', 'Sun, Yi', 'Morris, Stephan W', 'Qiu, Caihong', 'Krause, Diane S']","['Cheng EC', 'Luo Q', 'Bruscia EM', 'Renda MJ', 'Troy JA', 'Massaro SA', 'Tuck D', 'Schulz V', 'Mane SM', 'Berliner N', 'Sun Y', 'Morris SW', 'Qiu C', 'Krause DS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520-8073, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Ploidies', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Serum Response Factor/genetics/physiology', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics/pathology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/blood/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37549-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-180596 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Mar 19;113(12):2826-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-180596.

Recently, these effects have been shown to be enhanced by pegylation of the G-CSF molecule, which also improves graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) via activation of invariant natural killer (iNK) T cells. We have compared G-CSF bound to a single PEG molecule (monopeg-G-CSF) as used clinically to a G-CSF molecule bound to multiple PEG molecules (multipeg-G-CSF) in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) disparate and matched models of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and GVL. We demonstrate that multipeg-G-CSF induces greater levels of progenitor cell, myelogenous, and iNKT cell expansion than monopeg-G-CSF, while inducing similar protection from GVHD. Despite this, multipeg-G-CSF enhanced CTL function in vivo and improved iNKT cell-dependent leukemia clearance.

Treatment failure (relapse or death) was analyzed using survival-based proportional hazards regression. Competing risks (relapse and nonrelapse mortality, NRM) were analyzed using generalized linear models of cumulative incidence-based proportional hazards. Excluding 4 (2.8%) patients lacking serostatus of donor or recipient, there were 140 subjects, of whom 50 relapsed and 24 died in remission. Pretransplant CMV seroprevalence was 55.7% in recipients, 57.1% in donors. Thirty-five (25.0%) grafts were from seronegative donor to seronegative recipient (D-/R-). On univariate analysis, D-/R- grafts were associated with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) than other grafts (median 1.06 versus 3.15 years, P < .05).

By WHO criteria 35 (42%) had refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1 or 2), 23 (27%) had refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) or RCMD and ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS), and the remaining 26 (31%) had refractory anemia (RA), myelodysplastic syndrome-unclassifiable (MDS-U), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (MDS/MPD), or myelodysplastic syndrome-not otherwise specified (MDS-NOS). Graft source was related in 47 (56%), unrelated donor (URD) marrow in 11 (13%), and unrelated cord blood (UCB) in 26 (31%).

Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment by day +42, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) by day +100, and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) by 1 year were 88% (80%-96%, 95% confidence interval [CI]), 43% (36%-50%, 95% CI), and 15% (10%-20%, 95% CI), respectively. One-year treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were 39% (28%-50%, 95% CI), 23% (12%-32%, 95% CI), 38% (28%-48%, 95% CI), and 48% (38%-58%, 95% CI) respectively.

Additionally, with MA conditioning, the incidence of relapse at 1 year trended lower at 16% (6%-26%, 95% CI) versus 35% (18%-52%, 95% CI) in NMA (P = .06), and a statistically significant decrease in relapse was noted in patients entering HCT with CR or <5% blasts with an incidence of 9% (0%-18%, 95% CI) (MA) versus 31% (11%-51%, 95% CI) (NMA) (P = 0.04). For those patients with > or =5% blasts, MA conditioning did not significantly decrease relapse rates. One-year TRM was similar between MA and NMA conditioning. For patients entering transplant in CR or with <5% blasts, prior treatment to reach this level did not impact rates of relapse or transplant-related mortality when all patients were analyzed; however, when broken down by conditioning intensity, there was a trend toward improved DFS in those NMA patients who were pretreated.

These data suggest that (1) blast percentage <5% at HSCT is the major predictor of improved DFS and relapse and prior treatment to reach this disease status may have value in leading to improved DFS; (2) MA conditioning is associated with lower relapse risk, particularly in patients with CR or <5% blasts, but is not able to overcome increased disease burden; (3) NMA conditioning yields equivalent TRM, DFS, and OS, and is reasonable in patients unsuited for MA conditioning; (4) the donor sources tested (PBSC, bone marrow [BM], or UCB) yielded similar outcomes.","['Warlick, Erica D', 'Cioc, Adina', 'Defor, Todd', 'Dolan, Michelle', 'Weisdorf, Daniel']","['Warlick ED', 'Cioc A', 'Defor T', 'Dolan M', 'Weisdorf D']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. ewarlick@umn.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(08)00447-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Jan;15(1):30-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.10.012.,10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.10.012 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on these observations, we investigated the contribution of miRNAs to acute myelogenous leukemia cell lineage-specific differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To facilitate the identification of miRNAs and their targets relevant to leukemic cell differentiation, changes miRNA expression were analyzed in the human leukemia cell line HL-60, which historically has been utilized to study lineage-specific changes in response to the differentiation agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). RESULTS: Using this approach, we have identified a panel of TPA-induced miRNAs that are expressed coincident with HL-60 stereotypic morphological changes characteristic of monocytic differentiation. The transferrin receptor 1(TfR-1; CD71), whose surface expression is downregulated during TPA-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation, has been identified as a target of the TPA-induced miRNA miR-320. Cell culture experiments indicate that enforced miR-320 expression can suppress TfR-1 expression and cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: TPA induces the expression of several miRNAs in HL-60 cells, one such miRNA (miR-320) contributes to downregulation of TfR-1 surface expression characteristically seen during HL-60 monocytic differentiation. Moreover, TfR-1-targeting miRNAs, such as miR-320, may have potential as novel therapeutic agents for cancer due to their inhibitory effects on cell proliferation.","['Schaar, Dale G', 'Medina, Daniel J', 'Moore, Dirk F', 'Strair, Roger K', 'Ting, Yi']","['Schaar DG', 'Medina DJ', 'Moore DF', 'Strair RK', 'Ting Y']","['University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA. schaardg@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00478-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Feb;37(2):245-55. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.002.,10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The assay was first validated in BCR-ABL wild-type and mutant vs BCR-ABL-negative cell lines. P-Tyr levels were then measured by ELISA in primary CD34(+) CML cells treated with IM. RESULTS: In vitro exposure to TKI resulted in decreases in the level of P-Tyr, in both BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and primary CD34(+) CML samples, which were comparable to the reduction in P-Tyr by flow cytometry and phosphorylation of CrkL by either Western blot or flow cytometry.

Novel targeted treatment modalities emerge, but their evaluation requires relevant in vitro models of lymphoblastic leukemia. Presently available cell lines do not fully represent this heterogeneous disease. Available in vitro culturing protocols do not support long-term proliferation of primary cells. We therefore aimed to develop a culture system that allows long-term proliferation of primary human B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary lymphoblastic leukemia cells were cultured in a defined serum-free medium, in the absence or presence of human hematopoietic growth factors or serum. RESULTS: In the defined serum-free medium, cells from 12 of 34 cases immediately proliferated in vitro. In the absence of hematopoietic growth factors and serum these cases proliferated for more than 1 year without signs of exhaustion. The culturing system supported different subtypes of lymphoblastic leukemia. Two chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphatic blastic phase, four bcr/abl-positive ALL, one etv6/abl-positive ALL, 2 e2a-pbx1-positive ALL, and one t(9;11)-positive ALL could be long-term expanded, as well as two ALL that displayed nontypical cytogenetics. Not all bcr/abl- or e2a-pbx1-positive ALL proliferated in vitro, demonstrating heterogeneity within these subtypes. The proliferating bcr/abl- and etv6/abl-positive cells displayed sensitivity to imatinib, demonstrating that their proliferation depended on the activity of these oncoproteins. CONCLUSION: The serum-free culturing system may be a valuable instrument in the study of ALL cell biology, as well as in the evaluation of novel targeted therapeutics.","['Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'Szuhai, Karoly', 'Goselink, Henriette M', 'van Schie, Marianke L J', 'van der Burg, Marja', 'de Jong, Danielle', 'Marijt, Erik W', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Nijmeijer BA', 'Szuhai K', 'Goselink HM', 'van Schie ML', 'van der Burg M', 'de Jong D', 'Marijt EW', 'Ottmann OG', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. b.a.nijmeijer@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00520-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Mar;37(3):376-85. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.11.002.

Our study confirms the expression of functional IgE receptors in both cell lines, but receptor-mediated signaling in the C2 line only supports the early stages of downstream signaling as shown by the phosphorylation of the gamma-chain and the failure to effect the phosphorylation of Syk. In contrast RBL-2H3 cells respond to sensitization with IgE and challenge with cognate antigen with tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma-subunits of the receptor complex followed by downstream phosphorylation of Syk and Ca(2+) mobilization, culminating in beta-hexosaminidase release. We propose that the identification of the precise signaling defect in C2 cells will yield useful information regarding the pathway leading to mast cell exocytosis and facilitate the restoration of the complete signaling cascade through complementation of the missing/defective signal transducer since signaling events downstream of Ca(2+) mobilization are intact as demonstrated by beta-hexosaminidase release following non-immunologic stimulation with the calcium ionophore, A23187.","['Hunter, Michael J', 'Iodice, Marco W', 'Pathak, Ashutosh K', 'Street, Mark A', 'Helm, Birgit A']","['Hunter MJ', 'Iodice MW', 'Pathak AK', 'Street MA', 'Helm BA']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC1203, Building 10-CRC, Room 3-3264, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. huntermj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dogs', 'Exocytosis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mastocytoma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(08)00745-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2008.10.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2009 Mar;46(6):1260-5. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2008.10.036.

Expression analysis is a technique used in transcriptomics, a branch of genomics that deals with the study of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and the extraction of information contained in the genes. This increase in information is reflected in the exon arrays, which require the use of new techniques in order to extract the information. The purpose of this study is to provide a tool based on a mixture of experts model that allows the analysis of the information contained in the exon arrays, from which automatic classifications for decision support in diagnoses of leukemia patients can be made. The proposed model integrates several cooperative algorithms characterized for their efficiency for data processing, filtering, classification and knowledge extraction. The Cancer Institute of the University of Salamanca is making an effort to develop tools to automate the evaluation of data and to facilitate de analysis of information. This proposal is a step forward in this direction and the first step toward the development of a mixture of experts tool that integrates different cognitive and statistical approaches to deal with the analysis of exon arrays. The mixture of experts model presented within this work provides great capacities for learning and adaptation to the characteristics of the problem in consideration, using novel algorithms in each of the stages of the analysis process that can be easily configured and combined, and provides results that notably improve those provided by the existing methods for exon arrays analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material used consists of data from exon arrays provided by the Cancer Institute that contain samples from leukemia patients. The methodology used consists of a system based on a mixture of experts. Each one of the experts incorporates novel artificial intelligence techniques that improve the process of carrying out various tasks such as pre-processing, filtering, classification and extraction of knowledge. This article will detail the manner in which individual experts are combined so that together they generate a system capable of extracting knowledge, thus permitting patients to be classified in an automatic and efficient manner that is also comprehensible for medical personnel. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The system has been tested in a real setting and has been used for classifying patients who suffer from different forms of leukemia at various stages. Personnel from the Cancer Institute supervised and participated throughout the testing period. Preliminary results are promising, notably improving the results obtained with previously used tools. The medical staff from the Cancer Institute considers the tools that have been developed to be positive and very useful in a supporting capacity for carrying out their daily tasks. Additionally the mixture of experts supplies a tool for the extraction of necessary information in order to explain the associations that have been made in simple terms. That is, it permits the extraction of knowledge for each classification made and generalized in order to be used in subsequent classifications. This allows for a large amount of learning and adaptation within the proposed system.","['Corchado, Juan M', 'De Paz, Juan F', 'Rodriguez, Sara', 'Bajo, Javier']","['Corchado JM', 'De Paz JF', 'Rodriguez S', 'Bajo J']","['Departamento de Informatica y Automatica, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain. corchado@usal.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/classification/*diagnosis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Probability']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['S0933-3657(08)00187-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2008.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2009 Jul;46(3):179-200. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2008.12.001.

METHODS: HL-60/MDR was established using All-Trans Retinoic Acid. With the HL-60 cells as ""tester"" and HL60/MDR as ""driver"", the cDNA library of HL-60/MDR was established by suppression subtractive hybridization. Then 12 of the resulting subtracted cDNA clones were selected for DNA sequencing and homology analysis. The obtained expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were analyzed with the GenBank BLASTN program to identify sequence homologies to known genes. RESULTS: The HL-60/MDR cells had different multi-drug resistance to six kinds of chemotherapeutic drugs. The 211 positive gene clones in differential cDNA library of HL-60/MDR cells were amplified with PCR and 46 gene clones exhibited differential expression (ratio >3). Twelve gene clones with significant differential expression (ratio >5) were screened out to homology analysis. Of these, 11 matched known genes and the rest 1 showed no significant homology to human or non-human known sequences. It was named as gene clone HA117. CONCLUSIONS: This effort provides the partial list of genes differential expressed in HL-60/MDR cells and a novel gene HA117 was found to be related to MDR. Identification of these genes contributes to our understanding of MDR development, and potentially provides candidate target genes to overcome MDR.","['Zheng, Gai-Huan', 'Fu, Jin-Rong', 'Xu, You-Hua', 'Jin, Xian-Qing', 'Liu, Wen-Li', 'Zhou, Jian-Feng']","['Zheng GH', 'Fu JR', 'Xu YH', 'Jin XQ', 'Liu WL', 'Zhou JF']","[""Affiliated Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', '*Gene Library', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(08)00500-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Aug;33(8):1120-3. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.018.

To better understand barriers to providing music in the clinic, we describe parents' attitudes about music for pediatric oncology outpatients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January 2005 and October 2007 in a pediatric oncology clinic in a tertiary hospital. Eligible subjects were one parent of pediatric leukemia patients. Surveys were distributed at a routine clinic visit as part of a study on the effects of music on subjective and objective well-being. Of the 67 eligible families, 45 (67%) parents responded; 82% reported playing music for the patient at home within the previous week. The most common reasons to use music for the patient were to entertain (88%), keep the patient company (71%), help the patient feel better (76%), or provide comfort (69%); fewer used music to distract the patient from pain (16%) or nausea (11%). Parents expected that music during clinic visits would have positive effects: relaxation (64%), comfort (42%), and/or distraction (33%); none expected negative effects. Parents often play music for their children, and they hold favorable attitudes about playing it in the clinic.

METHODS: Female mice were randomly divided into four groups: group A [controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) group], group B (COS group with progesterone for luteal-phase-support), group C (COS group with progesterone and estradiol for luteal-phase-support), and group D of natural cycle group. Pinopodes were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) in the uterine endometrium of pregnant mice on pregnancy days (pd) 3 - 5. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) protein was determined by immunohistochemistry in the uterine endometrium of pregnant mice on pd 3 - 5. RESULTS: (1) In groups B, C, and D, there were small developed pinopodes in the endometrial surface of pregnant mouse on day 3; there were large fully developed pinopodes in endometrial surface, which was smooth with well defined borders resembling a mushroom on day 4. The regressing pinopodes were observed on day 5. In group A, there were small developed pinopodes in endometrial surface of pregnant mouse on day 3. The regressing pinopodes were seen on day 4. (2) In the pregnant mice of groups C and D, the level of LIF protein on days 3 - 5 (138.5 +/- 20.3, 143.1 +/- 19.0) was significantly higher than group A (103.2 +/- 5.0, P < 0.05), and strong immunostaining of LIF protein was found on day 4 of gestation. In group B, the level of LIF protein on days 3 - 5 (123.5 +/- 10.8) was significantly higher than group A (P < 0.05), but significantly lower than groups C and D (P < 0.05). Strong immunostaining of LIF protein was found on day 4 of gestation. In group A, weak immunostaining of LIF protein peaked on day 3 of gestation. In groups B, C, and D, the level of LIF protein on day 4 was significantly higher than group A on day 3 (F = 55.76, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Estradiol supplementation during the luteal phase can improve the expression of LIF and pinopodes in mouse endometrium in controlled ovarian stimulation cycles and redress the harmful effect on implantation window by COS. Therefore, estradiol supplementation can improve the endometrial receptivity.","['Zhang, Cui-lian', 'Xie, Juan-ke', 'Zhang, Shao-di', 'Qiao, Yu-huan']","['Zhang CL', 'Xie JK', 'Zhang SD', 'Qiao YH']","['Histology and Embryology Laboratory of Basic Medical College, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,16210370R,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Epithelial Cells/ultrastructure', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/agonists/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Luteal Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Ovulation Induction', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/pharmacology/supply & distribution']",2009/01/13 09:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Dec;43(12):937-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation can be triggered by embryoid body (EB) formation, which involves ES cell aggregation in suspension. EB growth in the absence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) leads EBs to mimic early embryonic development, giving rise to markers representative of endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Here, we have used microarrays to investigate differences in gene expression between 3 undifferentiated ES cell lines, and also between undifferentiated ES cells and Day 1-4 EBs. RESULTS: An initial array study identified 4 gene expression changes between 3 undifferentiated ES cell lines. Tissue culture conditions for ES differentiation were then optimized to give the maximum range of gene expression and growth. -Undifferentiated ES cells and EBs cultured with and without LIF at each day for 4 days were subjected to microarray analysis. -Differential expression of 23 genes was identified. 13 of these were also differentially regulated in a separate array comparison between undifferentiated ES cells and compartments of very early embryos. A high degree of inter-replicate variability was noted when confirming array results. Using a panel of marker genes, RNA amplification and RT-PCR, we examined expression pattern variation between individual -D4-Lif EBs. We found that individual EBs selected from the same dish were highly variable in gene expression profile. CONCLUSION: ES cell lines derived from different mouse strains and carrying different genetic modifications are almost invariant in gene expression profile under conditions used to maintain pluripotency. Tissue culture conditions that give the widest range of gene expression and maximise EB growth involve the use of 20% serum and starting cell numbers of 1000 per EB. 23 genes of importance to early development have been identified; more than half of these are also identified using similar studies, thus validating our results. EBs cultured in the same dish vary widely in terms of their gene expression (and hence, undoubtedly, in their future differentiation potential). This may explain some of the inherent variability in differentiation protocols that use EBs.","['Mansergh, Fiona C', 'Daly, Carl S', 'Hurley, Anna L', 'Wride, Michael A', 'Hunter, Susan M', 'Evans, Martin J']","['Mansergh FC', 'Daly CS', 'Hurley AL', 'Wride MA', 'Hunter SM', 'Evans MJ']","['School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, UK. mansergf@tcd.ie']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Dev Biol,BMC developmental biology,100966973,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-213X-9-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-213X-9-5 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Dev Biol. 2009 Jan 9;9:5. doi: 10.1186/1471-213X-9-5.,10.1186/1471-213X-9-5 [doi],20090109,['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC2656490,,,,,,,,"['GEO/GSE8625', 'GEO/GSE8766', 'GEO/GSE8881']",,,,,,,,,,

In order to better understand and define the role of 5-LO in B cells, we investigated the expression of 5-LO mRNA and protein in subsets of B cells from human tonsils and different types of B cell lymphoma. RESULTS: Based on RT-PCR and western blot/immunohistochemical staining, with a polyclonal antibody raised against 5-LO, high expression of 5-LO was found in mantle zone B cells from tonsils. By contrast, only a weak expression of 5-LO was detected in germinal centre cells and no expression in plasma cells from tonsils. This pattern of 5-LO expression was preserved in malignant lymphoma with high expression in mantle B cell lymphoma (MCL) and weak or no expression in follicular lymphoma. Primary leukemized MCL, so called B-prolymphocytic leukaemia cells, and MCL cell lines also expressed 5-LO and readily produced LTB4 after activation. CONCLUSION: The present report demonstrates the expression of 5-LO mainly in normal and malignant mantle zone B cells while the expression is low or absent in germinal centre B cells and plasma cells, indicating a role of the 5-LO pathway in B cells before the cells finally differentiate to plasma cells.","['Mahshid, Yilmaz', 'Lisy, Marcus-Rene', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Spanbroek, Rainer', 'Flygare, Jenny', 'Christensson, Birger', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Habenicht, Andreas J R', 'Claesson, Hans-Erik']","['Mahshid Y', 'Lisy MR', 'Wang X', 'Spanbroek R', 'Flygare J', 'Christensson B', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Sander B', 'Habenicht AJ', 'Claesson HE']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. yilmaz.mahshid@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Immunol,BMC immunology,100966980,"['1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*enzymology/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/*enzymology/immunology', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*enzymology/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*enzymology/immunology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/03/04 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2172-10-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2172-10-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Immunol. 2009 Jan 9;10:2. doi: 10.1186/1471-2172-10-2.,10.1186/1471-2172-10-2 [doi],20090109,,PMC2631017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long-term rate of leukaemic transformation in unselected MPD patients was studied in well-defined MPD populations in Gothenburg, Sweden and the Cote d'Or area, Burgundy, France, respectively. Over a median observation time of 15 yr, 56 subjects (7%) out of a total of 795 patients with Ph- MPD transformed to AML. The yearly incidence of AML transformation was 0.38% in polycythaemia vera (PV), 0.37% in essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and 1.09% in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). The incidence of AML development was significantly higher in IMF as compared with both PV and ET (P = 0.002 and P = 0.02, respectively). Six of the patients who developed AML had never been treated with cytoreductive agents and two had only been exposed to interferon. In IMF, the average time from diagnosis to AML transformation was 42 +/- 33 months, which was significantly shorter than for both PV and ET (88 +/- 56 and 76 +/- 57 months; P = 0.0075 and P = 0.027, respectively). The time from diagnosis to AML transformation appears to be a continuous event as regards all three MPD entities. It was shown that 17 out of the 18 patients with PV who developed AML were females; this was true despite the fact that the male/female ratio for the whole PV group was 146/171 (0.85). As regards ET and IMF patients who transformed to AML, the gender ratio showed slight male predominance (1.33 and 1.13, respectively).

A positive correlation between the appearance of an antibody recognizing the central region (Asp197 to Leu216) on Gp46, gp46-197, and the severity of ATL has been demonstrated. In this study, five male Nihon Hakusyoku rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the gp46-197 region to clarify its action and mechanism. Two of the rabbits showed piloerection, anorexia, and somnolence, and died soon after booster administration. The serum calcium level of the dead rabbits was significantly high, compared to those of surviving rabbits. Interestingly, amino acid sequences homologous with gp46-197 were found in the carboxyl-terminal half of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclast inhibitory factor. To confirm the effect of the gp46-197 region on osteogenesis in vivo, the peptide was intraperitoneally administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The administration of the gp46-197 peptide resulted in a decrease of bone mineral density (BMD), a significant increase of serum calcium level, and inhibition of normal bone growth in both short- and long-term experiments. In rats, femoral growth inhibition by the gp46-197 peptide was restored by the coadministration of recombinant human OPG.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has anti-inflammatory effects and promotes tolerogenic/Th2 responses while favouring embryonic development. We investigated the potential regulatory role of VIP on human trophoblast cells, maternal pro-inflammatory responses and trophoblast-maternal leukocyte interactions. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We tested VIP effects directly on a trophoblast cell line (Swan 71 cells) and after co-culture with maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as models of the feto-maternal dialogue. We also co-cultured maternal and paternal PBMCs to test effects of endogenous VIP on maternal alloresponses. KEY RESULTS: Swan 71 cells express VPAC(1) receptors and VIP induced their proliferation and the expression of leukaemia inhibitor factor, a pro-implantatory marker. After interaction with trophoblast cells, VIP increased Foxp3, the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells within maternal PBMCs and transforming growth factor beta expression. Also, during the trophoblast-maternal PBMCs interaction, VIP reduced pro-inflammatory mediators [interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, nitric oxide], while increasing IL-10. Trophoblast cells produced VIP which dose-dependently suppressed allomaternal responses, accompanied by reduced expression of the T cell transcription factor, T-bet. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Vasoactive intestinal peptide induced pro-implantatory markers and trophoblast cell proliferation, while controlling the initial pro-inflammatory response, by increasing maternal regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines. As an autocrine regulatory peptide VIP might contribute to fetal survival through two mechanisms; a direct trophic effect on trophoblast cells and an immunomodulatory effect that favours tolerance to fetal antigens.","['Fraccaroli, Laura', 'Alfieri, Julio', 'Larocca, Luciana', 'Calafat, Mario', 'Roca, Valeria', 'Lombardi, Eduardo', 'Ramhorst, Rosanna', 'Leiros, Claudia Perez']","['Fraccaroli L', 'Alfieri J', 'Larocca L', 'Calafat M', 'Roca V', 'Lombardi E', 'Ramhorst R', 'Leiros CP']","['Immunopharmacology Laboratory, School of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo Implantation/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Inflammation Mediators/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy/*immunology', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*immunology/metabolism', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/05/19 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [medline]']","['BPH055 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5381.2008.00055.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Jan;156(1):116-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2008.00055.x.,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2008.00055.x [doi],,,PMC2697780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer and Leukemia Group B 79804.,480-8,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about cancer surveillance (mammography, clinical breast examination, and pelvic examination) behaviors in long-term (9-16 years) breast cancer survivors. This report describes the relation of these behaviors to demographic and clinical characteristics, psychological symptoms, body satisfaction, and social support. METHODS: Survivors who had participated in Cancer and Leukemia Group B treatment Trial 8541 completed a survey that included questions on breast cancer surveillance and pelvic examination, psychological well being, body satisfaction, and social support. RESULTS: The participation rate was 78% and included 245 breast cancer survivors. Survivors (n = 107; 44%) reported completing breast cancer surveillance (mammography and clinical breast examination) and completing pelvic examination (n = 162; 68%) within recommended guidelines. There were no significant associations between breast cancer surveillance and breast cancer anxiety, depression, stressful life events, body satisfaction, social support, or demographic characteristics. Survivors within recommended guidelines for pelvic examinations were younger (P = .05), married (P = .003), had health insurance (P = .004), and had lower depression scores (P = .005) than survivors who underused or overused pelvic examination. In addition, survivors within recommended pelvic examination guidelines had significantly lower levels of breast cancer anxiety (P = .03) compared with survivors who underused pelvic examination. CONCLUSIONS: Many long-term breast cancer survivors were not within recommended cancer surveillance guidelines. Private health insurance was associated with following recommendations for pelvic examinations, although such a relation did not exist for breast cancer surveillance. The results of this study have implications for the development of educational programs to improve cancer surveillance among the growing population of long-term breast cancer survivors.","['Katz, Mira L', 'Donohue, Kathleen A', 'Alfano, Catherine M', 'Day, Jeannette M', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Paskett, Electra D']","['Katz ML', 'Donohue KA', 'Alfano CM', 'Day JM', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Paskett ED']","['Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and College of Public Health, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. mira.katz@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Depression/psychology', 'Female', 'Health Planning Guidelines', 'Humans', 'Mammography', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Compliance', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Pelvic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Social Support', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2009/01/13 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/13 09:00'],"['2009/01/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24063 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Feb 1;115(3):480-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24063.,10.1002/cncr.24063 [doi],,"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA026806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA016450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA107079/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA008025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA011789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG16602/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG016602/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA012046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA057707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA004457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107079/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3912846,,,,,['NIHMS548081'],,,,['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

Elevated circulating levels of angiogenic factors in CLL have been repeatedly reported. Nevertheless, the issue of bone marrow neovascularization in CLL remains controversial, partly due to limited number of published studies, different methods of assessing microvessel density (MVD) and small patient cohorts. Moreover, there are very scarce data regarding the relationship of marrow angiogenesis to prognostic markers in CLL. Our objectives were: 1. To assess bone marrow MVD in CLL using two different monoclonal antibodies and a reproducible method of MVD quantification; 2. To examine the possible association of marrow MVD and clinical course, pattern of marrow infiltration, Rai stage, cytogenetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and mutation status of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH). MVD was higher using CD34 vs vWF antibody (p<0.0001). However, no MVD differences were detected between CLL subgroups subdivided according to the above-mentioned prognostic factors. In conclusion, MVD assessment using anti-CD34 resulted in higher MVD counts than when using anti-vWF antibody. No association of MVD with any prognostic factors was observed, possibly due to the limited patient cohort. As the need for bone marrow trephine biopsies in CLL is significantly decreasing, a standardized method of neovascularization assessment is required to enable possible multicentre studies in order to conduct larger investigations and thereby shed more light on the real clinical significance of bone marrow angiogenesis in CLL.","['Smolej, L', 'Kasparova, P']","['Smolej L', 'Kasparova P']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical Hematology, University Hospital and Medical School, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. smolej@seznam.cz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply/*pathology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Microvessels/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*diagnosis', 'von Willebrand Factor/analysis']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/03/06 09:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [medline]']","['APM987 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00987.x [doi]']",ppublish,APMIS. 2008 Dec;116(12):1058-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00987.x.,10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00987.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We collected data on 103 infants at the time of their first treatment with high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX), 5 g/m(2). Children <6 months of age received two-third of the calculated dose based on body surface area (BSA), children 6-12 months three-fourth of the calculated dose, and children >12 months full dose. RESULTS: The median steady-state MTX concentration at the end of the 24-hr infusion was 57.8 microM (range 9.5-313). The median systemic clearance was 6.22 L/hr/m(2) BSA, and tended to increase with age (P = 0.099). Boys had higher clearance than girls, 6.77 and 5.28 L/hr/m(2) (P = 0.030), and tended to have lower median MTX concentration at 24 hr. Eight infants had MTX levels below 20 microM, a level judged to be sufficient in B-lineage ALL in children >1 year of age. All infants tolerated the dose well enough to receive a second dose of HD MTX without dose reduction. We found no significant effect on disease-free survival for MTX steady-state concentration, MTX clearance, or time to MTX below 0.2 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide no support for a change in the dosing rules for MTX used in Interfant-99. However, in view of the poor treatment results for infants, one might consider increase in the dose for patients who reach plasma levels below median after the first MTX dose.","['Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Hovi, Liisa', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Mann, Georg', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Stary, Jan', 'Hann, Ian', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Lonnerholm G', 'Valsecchi MG', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Schrappe M', 'Hovi L', 'Campbell M', 'Mann G', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Li CK', 'Stary J', 'Hann I', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. gudmar.lonnerholm@kbh.uu.se""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21925 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 May;52(5):596-601. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21925.,10.1002/pbc.21925 [doi],,,,,,,,,,['Interfant-99 study group'],,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

It was during the same era that protein kinase C was discovered and oncogene v-src was shown to have protein kinase activity. Staurosporine was first isolated from a culture of Actinomyces that originated in a soil sample collected in Mizusawa City, Japan. Thereafter, indolocarbazole compounds have been isolated from a variety of organisms. The biosynthesis of staurosporine and related indolocarbazoles was finally elucidated during the past decade through genetic and biochemical studies. Subsequently, several novel indolocarbazoles have been produced using combinatorial biosynthesis. In 1986, 9 years since its discovery, staurosporine and related indolocarbazoles were shown to be nanomolar inhibitors of protein kinases. They can thus be viewed as forerunners of today's crop of novel anticancer drugs. The finding led many pharmaceutical companies to search for selective protein kinase inhibitors by screening natural products and through chemical synthesis. In the 1990s, imatinib, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was synthesized and, following human clinical trials for chronic myelogenous leukemia, it was approved for use in the USA in 2001. In 1992, mammalian topoisomerases were shown to be targets for indolocarbazoles. This opened up new possibilities in that indolocarbazole compounds could selectively interact with ATP-binding sites of not only protein kinases but also other proteins that had slight differences in ATP-binding sites. ABCG2, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, was recently identified as an important new target for indolocarbazoles.","['Nakano, Hirofumi', 'Omura, Satoshi']","['Nakano H', 'Omura S']","['Laboratory of Natural Product Organic Chemistry, Center for Basic Research, Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan. nakanoh@insti.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Actinobacteria/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*history/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*history/pharmacology', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/history/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/*history/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ja20084 [pii]', '10.1038/ja.2008.4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2009 Jan;62(1):17-26. doi: 10.1038/ja.2008.4.

DESIGN: Case report and literature review. SETTING: A tertiary pediatric critical care unit in a university teaching hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Proximal splenic artery embolization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An 8-yr-old boy presented with abdominal pain radiating to the left shoulder 9 days after completing induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imaging revealed a splenic rupture with parenchymal and subcapsular hematomas, with no evidence of active extravasations. The patient was admitted to the pediatric critical care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring and frequent measurements of hemoglobin. His lowest recorded hemoglobin and hematocrit were 63 g/L and 0.19 L/L, respectively. Posttransfusion of packed red blood cells, he was taken to interventional radiology for proximal splenic artery embolization under moderate sedation. Several coils were successfully placed in the proximal splenic arterial system resulting in a marked reduction of splenic blood flow without disruption of collaterals. The patient recovered well from proximal splenic artery embolization in the pediatric critical care unit and experienced short lasting abdominal pain and fever for 1 day. He was discharged home 4 days after the procedure and follow-up imaging showed resolving hematomas with preserved splenic blood flow. CONCLUSION: Proximal splenic artery embolization in children may be a safe therapeutic alternative to either conservative or surgical management in spontaneous splenic rupture. Preservation of splenic tissue with a reduced risk of repeated hemorrhage can be obtained with proximal splenic artery embolization.","['Bellingham, Geoff A', 'Kribs, Stewart', 'Kornecki, Anat', 'Scott, Leslie', 'Leaker, Michael', 'Fraser, Douglas D']","['Bellingham GA', 'Kribs S', 'Kornecki A', 'Scott L', 'Leaker M', 'Fraser DD']","['Departments of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Risk Assessment', '*Splenic Artery', 'Splenic Rupture/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818e38fb [doi]', '00130478-200901000-00042 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2009 Jan;10(1):e1-4. doi: 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818e38fb.,10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818e38fb [doi],,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were obtained from 47 patients with leukemia at diagnosis before chemotherapy (mean age: 67 mo; 30 males and 17 females) and from 47 healthy controls (mean age: 59 mo; 27 males and 20 females). We measured the blood platelet indices using an automated counter. MPV was higher in the leukemia group, but it was not statistically significant. However, PDW was significantly lower (P<0.001) in leukemia group. There was no significant difference in the MPV or PDW in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia versus acute myeloblastic leukemia. In conclusion, we found no significant difference in the MPV between the 2 groups. PDW proposed as indicators of certain pathologic conditions and it seems possible to use PDW as screening. However, platelet indices (MPV and PDW) cannot be used as indicator to discriminate between the subtypes of leukemia in children.

However, there are limited data characterizing IFI in children.

The cumulative incidence of IFI was 6.9%; this comprised cases of proven, probable and possible IFI at rates of 1.2%, 3.0%, and 2.7%, respectively. The infected lesions were lung in 14 patients, liver in 5 patients, brain in 3 patients, fungemia in 2 patients, kidney in 1 patient, and endophthalmitis in 1 patient. The mortality of IFI was 48.2%, excluding patients who died due to relapse and interstitial pneumonitis; in particular, 71.4% patients with a lung lesion (10/14) died due to IFI. Fifty-nine pediatric patients died in our institution over the 10-year period of the study and IFI was the direct cause of death in 18.6% (11/59) of the patients. Risk factors for IFI with chemotherapy and SCT were also analyzed. Univariate analysis showed that age at diagnosis older than 10 years, relapse of original disease, long-term administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were the risk factors for IFI. All patients with IFI received long-term antibiotic therapy. AML was most strongly associated using a multivariate analysis.

However, the cellular and biochemical implications of microtubule disruption are not fully understood. Using a proteomic approach, we found that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A, was increased in plasma membrane extracts from chronic myeloid leukemia cells after microtubule disruption. In addition, we found that two peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, cyclophilin A and pin1, are overexpressed up to 10-fold in hematological malignancies compared with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although previous reports suggest that cyclophilin A is localized to the cytosol of mammalian cells, we found that cyclophilin A and pin1 are both localized to the nucleus and nuclear domains in hematopoietic cells. Microtubule disruption of hematopoietic cells caused a dramatic subcellular redistribution of cyclophilin A and pin1 from the nucleus to the cytosol and plasma membrane. We suggest that this accounts for the increased cyclophilin A at the plasma membrane of chronic myeloid leukemia cells after microtubule disruption. The subcellular redistribution of cyclophilin A and pin1 occurred in a c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase- and serine protease-dependent manner. Moreover, the altered subcellular localization of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerases occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner after microtubule disruption and was found to correlate with G(2)/M arrest and precede induced cell death. These results suggest that the function of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases may be influenced by microtubule dynamics throughout the cell cycle, and their altered localization may be an important part of the mechanism by which microtubule-disrupting agents exert their cytostatic effects.","['Bane, Fiona T', 'Bannon, John H', 'Pennington, Stephen R', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M', 'Mc Gee, Margaret M']","['Bane FT', 'Bannon JH', 'Pennington SR', 'Campiani G', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM', 'Mc Gee MM']","['School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cyclophilin A/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Silver Staining', 'Trypsin/chemistry']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['jpet.108.148130 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.108.148130 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 Apr;329(1):38-47. doi: 10.1124/jpet.108.148130.

Several unique genes were identified that were overexpressed in leukemic cells, including TNFSF11, RGS13, MAFb, CSPG2, C/EBP-alpha, and TCF4; 200 of the most highly overexpressed ATL genes were analyzed by the Pathway Studio, version 4.0 program. ATL leukemia cells were characterized by an increase in genes linked to ""central"" genes CDC2/cyclin B1, SYK/LYN, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and BIRC5. Because of its potential therapeutic importance, we focused our studies on the regulation and function of BIRC5, whose expression was increased in 13 of 14 leukemia samples. TCF4 reporter assays and transfection of DN-TCF4 demonstrated that TCF4 regulates BIRC5 gene expression. Functionally, transfection of ATL cells with BIRC5 shRNA decreased BIRC5 expression and cell viability 80%. Clinical treatment of ATL patients with Zenapax or bortezomib decreased BIRC5 expression and cell viability.

Since polyglutamylation of antifolates is crucial for their pharmacological activity in leukemia, loss of FPGS function results in decreased cellular levels of polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates and consequent drug resistance. Whereas resistance to pulse exposure to antifolates is frequently associated with loss of FPGS activity, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we explored the molecular basis of antifolate resistance in human MTX-resistant leukemia cell lines displaying marked loss of FPGS activity. We demonstrate that these MTX-resistant cells exhibit impaired splicing of FPGS mRNA based on intron retention and/or exon skipping, thereby resulting in loss of FPGS function due to premature translation termination. Furthermore, analysis of FPGS transcripts in blood or bone marrow specimens from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed exon 12 skipping, both at diagnosis and at relapse, the latter of which occurs after high-dose MTX-containing chemotherapy. These results constitute the first demonstration of the loss of FPGS function via aberrant mRNA splicing, thereby resulting in loss of antifolate retention and drug resistance.

To determine their relevance in PMF, we retrospectively examined the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities and karyotypic evolution on the outcome of 256 patients. Baseline cytogenetic status impacted significantly on survival: patients with favorable abnormalities (sole deletions in 13q or 20q, or trisomy 9 +/- one other abnormality) had survivals similar to those with normal diploid karyotypes (median, 63 and 46 months, respectively), whereas patients with unfavorable abnormalities (rearrangement of chromosome 5 or 7, or > or = 3 abnormalities) had a poor median survival of 15 months. Patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 had a median survival of only 5 months.

The majority of cases (91%) had blasts cells that simultaneously expressed either T-lineage plus myeloid markers (T/myeloid, n = 20) or B-lineage plus myeloid markers (B/myeloid, n = 12). Overall survival rates for the B/myeloid and T/myeloid subgroups were not significantly different from each other or from the rate for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but were inferior to the outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients who failed to achieve complete remission with AML-directed therapy could often be induced with a regimen of prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase. Analysis of gene-expression patterns identified a subset of biphenotypic leukemias that did not cluster with T-cell ALL, B-progenitor ALL, or AML. We propose that treatment for biphenotypic leukemia begin with one course of AML-type induction therapy, with a provision for a switch to lymphoid-type induction therapy with a glucocorticoid, vincristine, and L-asparaginase if the patient responds poorly. We also suggest that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is often not required for cure of these patients.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Shurtleff, Sheila', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Campana, Dario', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Downing, James R', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Onciu M', 'Pounds S', 'Shurtleff S', 'Cao X', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Campana D', 'Razzouk BI', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Downing JR', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39083-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-187351 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 21;113(21):5083-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-187351.

Here we report that Tax was negatively regulated by PDLIM2, which promoted Tax K48-linked polyubiquitination. In addition, PDLIM2 recruited Tax from its functional sites into the nuclear matrix where the polyubiquitinated Tax was degraded by the proteasome. Consistently, PDLIM2 suppressed Tax-mediated signaling activation, cell transformation, and oncogenesis both in vitro and in animal. Notably, PDLIM2 expression was down-regulated in HTLV-I-transformed T cells, and PDLIM2 reconstitution reversed the tumorigenicity of the malignant cells.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO), another inorganic trivalent semimetal, is an effective therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia, and there is investigation of its possible efficacy in prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of arsenic action in male urogenital tract tissues is not clear. Because the androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in spermatogenesis and prostate cancer, we explored the possibility that trivalent arsenic regulates AR function. We found that arsenic inhibited AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer and Sertoli cells using reporter gene assays testing several androgen response element-containing regions and by assessing native target gene expression. Arsenic inhibition of AR activity was not due to down-regulation of AR protein levels, decreased hormone binding to AR, disruption of AR nuclear translocation, or interference with AR-DNA binding in vitro. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that arsenic inhibited AR recruitment to an AR target gene enhancer in vivo. Consistent with a deficiency in AR-chromatin binding, arsenic disrupted AR amino and carboxyl termini interaction. Furthermore, ATO caused a significant decrease in prostate cancer cell proliferation that was more pronounced in cells expressing AR compared with cells depleted of AR. In addition, inhibition of AR activity by ATO and by the AR antagonist, bicalutamide, was additive. Thus, arsenic-induced male infertility may be due to inhibition of AR activity. Further, because AR is an important target in prostate cancer therapy, arsenic may serve as an effective therapeutic option.","['Rosenblatt, Adena E', 'Burnstein, Kerry L']","['Rosenblatt AE', 'Burnstein KL']","['1600 Northwest Tenth Avenue (R-189), Miami, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Androgen Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Androgens)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (NCOA2 protein, human)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', 'A0Z3NAU9DP (bicalutamide)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Androgen Antagonists/pharmacology', '*Androgen Receptor Antagonists', 'Androgens/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Anilides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2/metabolism', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Receptors, Androgen/chemistry/metabolism/physiology', 'Response Elements/physiology', 'Tosyl Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/01/10 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/01/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['me.2008-0235 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2008-0235 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2009 Mar;23(3):412-21. doi: 10.1210/me.2008-0235.

Here we identify the transcription factors that drive redox- and BCR-ABL1-dependent Fyn expression. Promoter deletion analysis in 293T, BaF3, BaF3-p210, and K562 cells identified the region essential for basal transcriptional activity. Mutation of Sp1 and Egr1 binding sites within the essential region diminished Fyn promoter activity and identified Egr1 as conferring redox sensitivity. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of Sp1 and Egr1 to the promoter fragments. Importantly, knockdown of Sp1 or Egr1 with small interference RNA or inhibition of Sp1 binding by mithramycin A repressed Fyn protein expression.

Decreased splenic viral load after IFN-alpha1 treatment correlated with an expansion of activated FV-specific CD8(+) T cells and NK cells into the spleen, whereas in IFN-alpha4- and -alpha9-treated mice it exclusively correlated with the activation of NK cells. The results demonstrate the distinct anti-retroviral effects of different IFN-alpha subtypes, which may be relevant for new therapeutic approaches.","['Gerlach, Nicole', 'Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Alter, Christina', 'Nair, Savita', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'James, Cassandra M', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Gerlach N', 'Gibbert K', 'Alter C', 'Nair S', 'Zelinskyy G', 'James CM', 'Dittmer U']","['Institut fur Virologie des Universitatsklinikums Essen, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/immunology/*pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/immunology', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology', 'Viral Load']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.200838311 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2009 Jan;39(1):136-46. doi: 10.1002/eji.200838311.,10.1002/eji.200838311 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, pregnant rats were treated with 50 mg/kg of 6-MP on 13 embryonic days (E), and fetuses were collected from 12 to 96 h after the treatment to examine the mechanism and time-course changes in neural cell death in the developing brain. The weights of fetal telencephalon and the thickness of the dorsal telencephalic wall of the fetuses were significantly reduced at 96 h. The number of pyknotic neural cells in the fetal telencephalon began to increase at 24 h, peaked at 36 h, and then gradually decreased toward 72 h. The nuclei of most of these pyknotic cells were stained positively by TUNEL method, which detects DNA fragmentation. Moreover, pyknotic cells were immunohistochemically positive for cleaved caspase-3, one of the key executioners of apoptosis, and the increased expression of the protein from 30 to 48 h was confirmed by using Western blot analysis. Also, electron microscopical features of the pyknotic cells showed ultrastructural characteristics of apoptosis. On the other hand, the number of mitotic and BrdU-positive neural cells in the telencephalon decreased from 30 to 72 h. These results suggest that 6-MP induced apoptotic cell death in neural cells in the rat fetal brain is probably due to cytotoxic action of 6-MP.","['Kanemitsu, H', 'Yamauchi, H', 'Komatsu, M', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Okazaki, S', 'Nakayama, H']","['Kanemitsu H', 'Yamauchi H', 'Komatsu M', 'Yamamoto S', 'Okazaki S', 'Nakayama H']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Graduate school of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. z021dc@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Teratogens)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brain/*drug effects/*embryology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Mercaptopurine/*toxicity', 'Neurons/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Organ Size', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Teratogens/*toxicity', 'Time Factors']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.14670/HH-24.317 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2009 Mar;24(3):317-24. doi: 10.14670/HH-24.317.,10.14670/HH-24.317 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis is an intrinsic cell death program that is crucial to maintain tissue homeostasis, for example in the hematopoietic system where there is a high turnover rate of cells. As a result, a decrease in the rate of apoptosis besides an increase in proliferation favors tumorigenesis as well as tumor progression. Further, the anti-leukemic action of current treatment approaches, including chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy, critically relies on intact cell death programs in cancer cells. Therefore, defects in apoptosis pathways are frequently associated with the resistance to anticancer therapies.

The requirement for dose intensification is linked to an increase in toxicity to noninvolved organs. Particularly for older patients and patients with comorbidities, efficient but toxicity-reduced schemes are needed. Myeloablative radioimmunotherapy is a targeted, internal radiotherapy that uses radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with affinity to the bone marrow. It involves the administration of high radiation doses (up to 30 Gy) to the bone marrow and spleen but without exposing radiosensitive organs to doses higher than 1-7 Gy. Added to conventional or intensity-reduced conditioning, myeloablative radioimmunotherapy may achieve a pronounced antileukaemic effect with tolerable toxicities. A rational and individual design of the ideal nuclide-antibody combination optimizes therapy. The anti-CD33, anti-CD45 and anti-CD66 mAbs appear to be ideal tracers so far. The beta-emitter (90)Y is coupled by DTPA and is the best nuclide for myeloablation. Approval trials for DTPA anti-CD66 mAb are underway in Europe, and in the near future these therapies may become applicable in practice. This review gives an overview of current myeloablative conditioning radioimmunotherapy. We discuss the selection of the optimal radioimmunoconjugate and discuss how radioimmunotherapy might be optimized in the future by individualization of therapy protocols.

A short review.,293-9,"The occasional observation of constitutional chromosomal abnormalities in patients with a malignant disease has led to a number of studies on their potential role in cancer development. Investigations of families with hereditary cancers and constitutional chromosomal abnormalities have been key observations leading to the molecular identification of specific genes implicated in tumorigenesis. Large studies have been reported on the incidence of constitutional chromosomal aberrations in patients with hematologic malignancies, but they could not confirm an increased risk for hematologic malignancy among carriers of structural chromosomal changes. However, it is of particular interest that constitutional structural aberrations with breakpoints similar to leukemia-associated specific breakpoints have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies. Because of insufficient data, it remains still unclear if these aberrations represent random events or are associated with malignancy. There has been a substantial discussion about mechanisms involved in constitutional structural chromosomal changes in the literature. The documentation of more patients with constitutional structural chromosomal changes could be of major importance. Most importantly, the molecular investigation of chromosomal regions involved in rearrangements could give useful information on the genetic events underlying constitutional anomalies, contributing to isolation of genes important in the development of the neoplastic process.

These processes are mediated in part by the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. Following restoration of homeostasis protein synthesis is resumed when the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1 dephosphorylates and reactivates eIF2alpha. Proteasome inhibitors, used to treat multiple myeloma patients evoke ER-stress and apoptosis by blocking the ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins (ERAD), however, the role of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in leukemic cells under conditions of proteasome inhibitor-mediated ER stress is currently unclear. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bcr-Abl-positive and negative leukemic cell lines were used to investigate the functional implications of PP1-related phosphatase activities on eIF2alpha phosphorylation in proteasome inhibitor-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. Rather unexpectedly, salubrinal, a recently identified PP1 inhibitor capable to protect against ER stress in various model systems, strongly synergized with proteasome inhibitors to augment apoptotic death of different leukemic cell lines. Salubrinal treatment did not affect the phosphorlyation status of eIF2alpha. Furthermore, the proapoptotic effect of salubrinal occurred independently from the chemical nature of the proteasome inhibitor, was recapitulated by a second unrelated phosphatase inhibitor and was unaffected by overexpression of a dominant negative eIF2alpha S51A variant that can not be phosphorylated. Salubrinal further aggravated ER-stress and proteotoxicity inflicted by the proteasome inhibitors on the leukemic cells since characteristic ER stress responses, such as ATF4 and CHOP synthesis, XBP1 splicing, activation of MAP kinases and eventually apoptosis were efficiently abrogated by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. CONCLUSIONS: Although PP1 activity does not play a major role in regulating the ER stress response in leukemic cells, phosphatase signaling nevertheless significantly limits proteasome inhibitor-mediated ER-stress and apoptosis.

In this study, we investigated the differentiation-inducing ability of nicotinic acid-related compounds in chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line. Proliferation of K562 leukemia cells was inhibited by several nicotinic acid-related compounds. Hemoglobin content was increased by nicotinic acid and by isonicotinic acid. Isonicotinic acid increased gamma-globin mRNA expression as much as sodium butyrate did. The nuclei of nicotinic acid and of isonicotinic acid-treated cells decreased in size and the chromatin became more condensed. It was verified that nicotinic acid and isonicotinic acid induced erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. Expression of glycophorin A was increased by sodium butyrate. In contrast, it was decreased by nicotinic acid and by isonicotinic acid, suggesting that these compounds differentiate K562 to erythrocytes through different pathways than sodium butyrate does.

But so far, the induced antileukemic T-cell responses have varied in specificity and efficacy, or have even mediated opposite effects. In an attempt to further characterize the DC/DCleu induced T-cell response pattern, immunoscope spectratyping, a novel and powerful tool to detect T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements was used in combination with functional flow cytometry and non-radioactive fluorolysis assays. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor T-cells were repeatedly stimulated, either with leukemic blasts (French-American-British, FAB M4eo) or the corresponding blast-derived DCs. Functional comparison revealed no significant difference in their T-cell stimulatory capacity, while the DC/DCleu fraction favored T-cells with a higher lytic activity, comprising a higher proportion of T-memory CD45R0+ cells. Stimulation with blasts and DC/DCleu induced a similar TCR restriction pattern, while stimulation with DC/DCleu favored the CD4 T-cell subset and seemed to cause a higher grade of restriction. In conclusion, a combined strategy using spectratyping with functional tests might not only provide useful information about the specificity and efficacy of the induced T-cell response, but also pave the way to gain effective T-cell clones for therapeutic use.","['Schuster, Friedhelm R', 'Buhmann, Raymund', 'Reuther, Susanne', 'Hubner, Bernd', 'Grabrucker, Christine', 'Liepert, Anja', 'Reibke, Roland', 'Lichtner, Peter', 'Yang, Ting', 'Kroell, Tanja', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Schuster FR', 'Buhmann R', 'Reuther S', 'Hubner B', 'Grabrucker C', 'Liepert A', 'Reibke R', 'Lichtner P', 'Yang T', 'Kroell T', 'Kolb HJ', 'Borkhardt A', 'Schmetzer H']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, Heinrich Heine University Medical Center, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', '*Blast Crisis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2008 Sep-Oct;5(5):275-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent genomewide analyses have identified a high frequency of DNA copy-number abnormalities in ALL, but the prognostic implications of these abnormalities have not been defined. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 221 children with high-risk B-cell-progenitor ALL with the use of single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarrays, transcriptional profiling, and resequencing of samples obtained at diagnosis. Children with known very-high-risk ALL subtypes (i.e., BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, hypodiploid ALL, and ALL in infants) were excluded from this cohort. A copy-number abnormality was identified as a predictor of poor outcome, and it was then tested in an independent validation cohort of 258 patients with B-cell-progenitor ALL. RESULTS: More than 50 recurring copy-number abnormalities were identified, most commonly involving genes that encode regulators of B-cell development (in 66.8% of patients in the original cohort); PAX5 was involved in 31.7% and IKZF1 in 28.6% of patients. Using copy-number abnormalities, we identified a predictor of poor outcome that was validated in the independent validation cohort. This predictor was strongly associated with alteration of IKZF1, a gene that encodes the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS. The gene-expression signature of the group of patients with a poor outcome revealed increased expression of hematopoietic stem-cell genes and reduced expression of B-cell-lineage genes, and it was similar to the signature of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, another high-risk subtype of ALL with a high frequency of IKZF1 deletion. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alteration of IKZF1 is associated with a very poor outcome in B-cell-progenitor ALL.","['Mullighan, Charles G', 'Su, Xiaoping', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Radtke, Ina', 'Phillips, Letha A A', 'Miller, Christopher B', 'Ma, Jing', 'Liu, Wei', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Schulman, Brenda A', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Clifford, Robert J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Reaman, Gregory', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Gerhard, Daniela S', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Campana, Dario', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Smith, Malcolm', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Downing, James R']","['Mullighan CG', 'Su X', 'Zhang J', 'Radtke I', 'Phillips LA', 'Miller CB', 'Ma J', 'Liu W', 'Cheng C', 'Schulman BA', 'Harvey RC', 'Chen IM', 'Clifford RJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Reaman G', 'Bowman WP', 'Devidas M', 'Gerhard DS', 'Yang W', 'Relling MV', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Campana D', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Pui CH', 'Smith M', 'Hunger SP', 'Willman CL', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (EBF1 protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]']","['NEJMoa0808253 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0808253 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2009 Jan 29;360(5):470-80. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0808253.

Among the tested samples, 25 were positive for the chromosomal translocation t(12;21), encoding the fusion gene translocation ETS-like leukemia/acute myeloid leukemia 1 (TEL/AML1). SAHA increased CD83 expression of TEL/AML1-positive blasts in conditions without ILs, and SAHA and VAL increased the number of CD86(+)80(-) cells in the presence of ILs. VAL and isobutyramid supported the allostimulatory capacities of TEL/AML1-positive, leukemic DC; VAL and SAHA reduced those of TEL/AML1-negative DC. Cytotoxic T cells sensitized with leukemic DC produced more IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha upon presentation of the TEL/AML1 peptide. They also induced the cytotoxic lysis of nondifferentiated blasts, which was enhanced when TEL/AML1-positive DC had developed after addition of VAL or SAHA.

DESIGN: Population based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: All public and private hospitals in Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 28 548 patients aged >or=60 years with an admission for an ADR during 1980-2000 followed for three years using the Western Australian data linkage system. RESULTS: 5056 (17.7%) patients had a repeat admission for an ADR. Repeat ADRs were associated with sex (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.15, for men), first admission in 1995-9 (2.34, 2.00 to 2.73), length of hospital stay (1.11, 1.05 to 1.18, for stays >or=14 days), and Charlson comorbidity index (1.71, 1.46 to 1.99, for score >or=7); 60% of comorbidities were recorded and taken into account in analysis. In contrast, advancing age had no effect on repeat ADRs. Comorbid congestive cardiac failure (1.56, 1.43 to 1.71), peripheral vascular disease (1.27, 1.09 to 1.48), chronic pulmonary disease (1.61, 1.45 to 1.79), rheumatological disease (1.65, 1.41 to 1.92), mild liver disease (1.48, 1.05 to 2.07), moderate to severe liver disease (1.85, 1.18 to 2.92), moderate diabetes (1.18, 1.07 to 1.30), diabetes with chronic complications (1.91, 1.65 to 2.22), renal disease (1.93, 1.71 to 2.17), any malignancy including lymphoma and leukaemia (1.87, 1.68 to 2.09), and metastatic solid tumours (2.25, 1.92 to 2.64) were strong predictive factors. Comorbidities requiring continuing care predicted a reduced likelihood of repeat hospital admissions for ADRs (cerebrovascular disease 0.85, 0.73 to 0.98; dementia 0.62, 0.49 to 0.78; paraplegia 0.73, 0.59 to 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity, but not advancing age, predicts repeat admission for ADRs in older adults, especially those with comorbidities often managed in the community. Awareness of these predictors can help clinicians to identify which older adults are at greater risk of admission for ADRs and, therefore, who might benefit from closer monitoring.","['Zhang, Min', ""Holman, C D'Arcy J"", 'Price, Sylvie D', 'Sanfilippo, Frank M', 'Preen, David B', 'Bulsara, Max K']","['Zhang M', 'Holman CD', 'Price SD', 'Sanfilippo FM', 'Preen DB', 'Bulsara MK']","['School of Population Health, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia. min.zhang@uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Comorbidity', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Western Australia/epidemiology']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1136/bmj.a2752 [doi]'],epublish,BMJ. 2009 Jan 7;338:a2752. doi: 10.1136/bmj.a2752.,10.1136/bmj.a2752 [doi] 338/jan07_3/a2752 [pii],20090107,,PMC2615549,['BMJ. 2009;338:a2436.

Retroviral Tax proteins from human T cell leukemia virus type 1 and type 2 (HTLV-1 and -2) are capable of activating IKK, yet only HTLV-1 infection causes T cell leukemia, which correlates with persistent activation of NF-kappaB induced by Tax1. Here, we show that the Tax proteins exhibit differential modes of IKK activation. The subunits of IKK are constitutively present in lipid rafts in activated forms in HTLV-1-infected T cells that express Tax. Disruption of lipid rafts impairs IkappaB kinase activation by Tax1. We also show that the cytoplasmic Tax1 protein persistently resides in the Golgi-associated lipid raft microdomains. Tax1 directs lipid raft translocation of IKK through selective interaction with IKKgamma and accordingly, depletion of IKKgamma impairs Tax1-directed lipid raft recruitment of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. In contrast, Tax2 activates NF-kappaB in a manner independent of lipid raft recruitment of IKK. These findings indicate that Tax1 actively recruits IKK to the lipid raft microdomains for persistent activation of NF-kappaB, thereby contributing to HTLV-1 oncogenesis.","['Huang, Jiannan', 'Ren, Tong', 'Guan, Hui', 'Jiang, Yixing', 'Cheng, Hua']","['Huang J', 'Ren T', 'Guan H', 'Jiang Y', 'Cheng H']","['Penn State Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/genetics/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32649-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M806390200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 6;284(10):6208-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M806390200.

When a patient dies after an unsuccessful transplantation, interested unrelated donors are informed about the failure by their donor centre. Studies focussing on failed related donations show that donors undergo an intense grieving process. As there are only two investigations about reactions from unrelated donors, knowledge about their reactions is less comprehensive. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of reactions of unrelated donors to the information of failed transplantations, subject to various communication methods (letter, phone). Questionnaires were sent to 395 unrelated donors who received the news of their recipients' deaths between November 2005 and August 2006. In addition, twelve in-depth interviews with selected donors were carried out. RESULTS: Unrelated donors were emotionally affected by the recipients' deaths, and it is appropriate to speak about a ""Donor Grief"" phenomenon, as the results of 325 returned questionnaires (return rate 82.3%) and in-depth interviews show. Donors demonstrated a range of feelings such as sadness, disappointment, grief, and helplessness. These feelings were often unexpectedly intense given the fact that the recipient was a stranger. Although the news caused grief, donors underlined that they nevertheless wanted to be informed. They preferred knowledge of the failure to uncertainty. The method of providing the information is only of secondary importance. Most donors favoured the way of communication they had experienced. CONCLUSION: This result indicates that both phone and letter communication can be justified. However, phone communication seems to be superior with respect to aspects of sensitivity. In spite of transplantation failure and the associated negative feelings, most donors were happy to have donated and would be willing to do so again. Our results underline the special responsibility of donor centres for informing and supporting unrelated volunteer donors in case their recipients have died.","['Wanner, Martina', 'Bochert, Sandra', 'Schreyer, Iris M', 'Rall, Gabi', 'Rutt, Claudia', 'Schmidt, Alexander H']","['Wanner M', 'Bochert S', 'Schreyer IM', 'Rall G', 'Rutt C', 'Schmidt AH']","['DKMS German Bone Marrow Donor Center, Tuebingen, Germany. wanner@dkms.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Health Serv Res,BMC health services research,101088677,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Grief', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Failure', '*Twins, Monozygotic', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/09 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/01/09 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']","['1472-6963-9-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6963-9-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Health Serv Res. 2009 Jan 7;9:2. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-9-2.,10.1186/1472-6963-9-2 [doi],20090107,,PMC2630924,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively investigated the prognostic roles of beta-catenin and topo IIalpha in a cohort of 59 patients with newly diagnosed AML by immunohistochemistry. Aberrant beta-catenin expression was demonstrated in 13 patients (22%), and it was more likely to occur in those with unfavorable karyotypes. Advanced age and poor performance status adversely influenced the achievement of complete remission, while neither aberrant beta-catenin expression nor enhanced topo IIalpha activity did. On multivariate survival analysis, four factors independently predicted a shortened overall survival: aberrant beta-catenin expression, high topo IIalpha activity, poor-risk cytogenetics, and presence of at least one comorbidity factor.

However, cure rates are much lower in many low-income countries (LICs), where most cases of ALL occur. Over the past several decades partnerships (""twinning"") between HIC and LIC pediatric oncology programs have led to major improvements in outcome for children with ALL in some LICs, often by developing time and resource intensive relationships that allow LIC centers to treat children with regimens similar or identical to those used in HICs. However, the resources are not available in most LICs to allow immediate introduction of intensive ALL treatment regimens similar to those used in HICs. With these thoughts in mind, we present a proposal for a systematic and graduated approach to ALL diagnosis, risk classification, and treatment in LICs. We have based the strategy and the proposed regimens on those developed by the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) and Children's Oncology Group (COG) over the past several decades, beginning with a first level regimen similar to CCG therapy of the early 1980s and then layering on successive treatment intensifications proven effective in randomized clinical trials. Simple monitoring rules are included to help centers decide when they are ready to add new treatment components.

It interacts with proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial activation and induction of apoptosis. Mcl-1 is essential for embryonal development and the maintenance of B cells, T cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. We have recently shown that induction of Mcl-1 by growth factors rescues primary human hepatocytes from CD95-mediated apoptosis. This prompted us to further analyze the relevance of Mcl-1 for hepatocellular homeostasis. Therefore, we generated a hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1 knockout mouse (Mcl-1(flox/flox)-AlbCre). Deletion of Mcl-1 in hepatocytes results in liver cell damage caused by spontaneous induction of apoptosis. Livers of Mcl-1(flox/flox)-AlbCre mice are smaller compared to control littermates, due to higher apoptosis rates. As a compensatory mechanism, proliferation of hepatocytes is enhanced in the absence of Mcl-1. Importantly, hepatic pericellular fibrosis occurs in Mcl-1 negative livers in response to chronic liver damage. Furthermore, Mcl-1(flox/flox)-AlbCre mice are more susceptible to hepatocellular damage induced by agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies or concanavalin A. CONCLUSION: The present study provides in vivo evidence that Mcl-1 is a crucial antiapoptotic factor for the liver, contributing to hepatocellular homeostasis and protecting hepatocytes from apoptosis induction.","['Vick, Binje', 'Weber, Achim', 'Urbanik, Toni', 'Maass, Thorsten', 'Teufel, Andreas', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Schuchmann, Marcus', 'Galle, Peter R', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning']","['Vick B', 'Weber A', 'Urbanik T', 'Maass T', 'Teufel A', 'Krammer PH', 'Opferman JT', 'Schuchmann M', 'Galle PR', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H']","['1st Department of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*deficiency/genetics', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/03/13 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.22664 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2009 Feb;49(2):627-36. doi: 10.1002/hep.22664.,10.1002/hep.22664 [doi],,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2753874,,,,,['NIHMS121542'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laromustine is a prodrug that yields a chloroethylating compound (VNP-4090-CE) and a carbamoylating compound (methyl isocyanate). The antineoplastic effect of laromustine is attributed primarily to the chloroethylating species, which causes the preferential alkylation of DNA at the O6 position of guanine, a lesion that results in interstrand crosslinks and, eventually, cell death. The carbamoylating species contributes to antitumor activity by inhibiting the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine transferase. Early phase I clinical trials in patients with solid tumors indicated that laromustine was associated with myelosuppression; few extramedullary toxicities were observed, indicating potential efficacy for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Phase II trials have been completed in patients with previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and relapsed AML. The most encouraging results were observed in patients over 60 years of age with poor-risk de novo AML for which no standard treatment exists. Laromustine is currently in phase II/III trials for AML and phase II trials for MDS and solid tumors. Laromustine appears to be a promising agent that will add to the armamentarium of drugs available to treat patients who do not respond to, or are not fit for, intensive chemotherapy, such as elderly individuals.","['Pigneux, Arnaud']",['Pigneux A'],"['Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Francois Magendie, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Avenue de Magellan, 33604 Pessac CEDEX, France. arnaud.pigneux@chu-bordeaux.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,IDrugs,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,100883655,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Isocyanates)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (VNP-4090-CE)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', 'C588JJ4BV9 (methyl isocyanate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Isocyanates/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Prodrugs/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism/pharmacokinetics']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,IDrugs. 2009 Jan;12(1):39-53.,,,,,,,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand why MiHA-targeted T cells have such a potent antitumor effect it is essential to evaluate their in vivo behavior. In the present work, we therefore addressed two specific questions: what is the proliferative dynamics of H7(a)-specifc T cells in tumors, and do H7(a)-specific T cells persist long-term after adoptive transfer? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By day 3 after adoptive transfer, we observed a selective infiltration of melanomas by anti-H7(a) T cells. Over the next five days, anti-H7(a) T cells expanded massively in the tumor but not in the spleen. Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7(a) T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7(a) T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7(a) by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7(a) memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7(a)-negative (B10.H7(b)) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7(a)-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7(a)-positive recipients. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although in general the tumor environment is not propitious to T-cell invasion and expansion, the present work shows that this limitation may be overcome by adoptive transfer of primed CD8 T cells targeted to an immunodominant MiHA (here H7(a)). At least in some cases, prolonged persistence of adoptively transferred T cells may be valuable for prevention of late cancer relapse in adoptive hosts. Our findings therefore suggest that it may be advantageous to target MiHAs with a restricted tissue distribution in order to promote persistence of memory T cells and thereby minimize the risk of cancer recurrence.","['Meunier, Marie-Christine', 'Baron, Chantal', 'Perreault, Claude']","['Meunier MC', 'Baron C', 'Perreault C']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '9H198D04WL (Thymic Factor, Circulating)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Thymic Factor, Circulating/immunology/metabolism']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004116 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(1):e4116. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004116.

Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking.

KA-A derivatives could prevent human cancer cell (promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60) growth with the same tendency as the inhibition of mammalian pols. Since pol beta is the smallest molecule, we used it to analyze the biochemical relationship with KA-A derivatives. From computer modeling analysis (i.e., docking simulation analysis), these compounds bound selectively to four amino acid residues (Leu11, Lys35, His51 and Thr79) of the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol beta, and the binding energy between compound 11 and pol beta was largest in the synthesized compounds.

Patients harboring such cancers have poor prognosis and adverse survival. A recombinant chimeric antibody, cPiPP, exhibiting high affinity and specificity for hCGbeta/hCG was engineered. This study was designed to determine whether this antibody alone or conjugated to curcumin can selectively kill tumor cells expressing hCGbeta. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study was carried out on MOLT-4 and U-937 cells expressing hCGbeta and on peripheral blood leukocytes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The anticancerous compound curcumin was conjugated to cPiPP. The binding of cPiPP and cPiPP-curcumin conjugate to cells was studied by flow cytometry and cytotoxicity by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), FACS with propidium iodide staining, trypan blue exclusion assay and microscopy. RESULTS: The antibody did not impair the growth of MOLT-4 and U-937 cells in culture. Its conjugate with curcumin, however, was lethal to both cell lines. The immunoconjugate killed tumor cells bearing the CD33 marker of an AML patient expressing hCGbeta but did not have a similar action on cells of another AML patient with the CD13 marker but who was negative for hCGbeta. CONCLUSION: A humanized antibody against hCGbeta linked to curcumin has potential for therapy of hCGbeta-expressing tumors.","['Vyas, Hemant K', 'Pal, Rahul', 'Vishwakarma, Ram', 'Lohiya, Nirmal K', 'Talwar, G P']","['Vyas HK', 'Pal R', 'Vishwakarma R', 'Lohiya NK', 'Talwar GP']","['Talwar Research Foundation, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Cell Separation', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Curcumin/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]']","['000188665 [pii]', '10.1159/000188665 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2009;76(2):101-11. doi: 10.1159/000188665.

In human myeloblastic leukemia cells, RA or D3 are known to cause MAPK signaling leading to myeloid or monocytic differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest. In this process, RA or D3 induces the early expression of CD38, a receptor that causes ERK signaling and propels further differentiation. Our study demonstrates that nicotinamide in combination with RA or D3 affected induced expression levels of CD38, CD11b and CD14, suggesting a cooperative function of nicotinamide and RA or D3. Nicotinamide transiently retarded the initial RA- or D3-induced expression of CD38, which subsequently reached the same nearly 100% expression. Nicotinamide induced ERK activation and further enhanced the RA-induced ERK activation, but the D3-induced ERK activation was diminished by nicotinamide, although levels still exceeded those induced by RA, suggesting lineage-specific nicotinamide responses. Nicotinamide enhanced both RA- and D3-induced CD11b expression, inducible oxidative metabolism, and G0 cell cycle arrest, accelerating their induced occurrence in all instances. Consistent with this, the RA- or D3-induced downregulation of PARP was enhanced by nicotinamide. Nicotinamide thus regulated RA- or D3-induced differentiation and G0 arrest, causing a transient delay in certain early aspects of the progression to terminal differentiation but ultimately accelerating the occurrence of terminally, functionally differentiated G0 cells.","['Shen, Miaoqing', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Shen M', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Niacinamide/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]']","['000188664 [pii]', '10.1159/000188664 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2009;76(2):91-100. doi: 10.1159/000188664.

To identify target cell populations affected, a differentiating primary liquid erythroid culture system using sca-1(+)cells from mouse bone marrow was developed and challenged with p38is SB-203580, SB-226882, and SB-267030. Drug-related alterations in genes involved at different stages of erythropoiesis, cell-surface antigen expression (CSAE), burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) colony formation, and cellular morphology (CM), growth (CG), and viability were evaluated. CSAE, CM, and decreases in BFU-E formation indicated delayed maturation, while CG and viability were unaffected. Terminal differentiation was delayed until day 14 versus day 7 in controls. CSAE demonstrated higher percentages of sca-1(+)cells after day 2 and reduced percentages of ter119(+) cells after day 7 in all treated cultures. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed a transient delay in expression of genes involved at early, intermediate, and late stages of erythropoiesis, followed by rebound expression at later time points. Results demonstrate p38is do not irreversibly inhibit erythrogenesis but induce a potency-dependent, transient delay in erythropoietic activity. The delay in activity is suggestive of effects on sca-1(+)bone marrow cells caused by alterations in expression of genes related to erythroid commitment and differentiation resulting in delayed maturation.","['Dalmas, Deidre A', 'Tierney, Lauren A', 'Zhang, Cindy', 'Narayanan, Padma K', 'Boyce, Rogely W', 'Schwartz, Lester W', 'Frazier, Kendall S', 'Scicchitano, Marshall S']","['Dalmas DA', 'Tierney LA', 'Zhang C', 'Narayanan PK', 'Boyce RW', 'Schwartz LW', 'Frazier KS', 'Scicchitano MS']","['Department of Safety Assessment, GlaxoSmithKline, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, USA. deidre.a.dalmas@gsk.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']","['0192623308327121 [pii]', '10.1177/0192623308327121 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2008 Dec;36(7):958-71. doi: 10.1177/0192623308327121.,10.1177/0192623308327121 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to investigate the effects of natsudaidain, a polymethoxyflavone isolated from Citrus plants, on mast cells. METHODS: We investigated the inhibitory effects of natsudaidain, which is a polymethoxyflavone isolated from Citrus plants, on histamine release, tumour necrosis factor-alpha production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in Ca ionophore-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia cells (A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells) by spectrofluorometric, ELISA and immunoblotting methods. KEY FINDINGS: The percent of histamine release from A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells pretreated with natsudaidain at 5, 25 and 50 microM was not changed as compared with non-treated A23187-stimulated cells. At 100 and 200 microM, natsudaidain pretreatment resulted in slightly reduced histamine release (% histamine release, 89.8+/-3.5% and 71.5+/-5.6% at 100 and 200 microM). Thus, natsudaidain hardly affects histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells, except at high concentrations. On the other hand, natsudaidain dose-dependently inhibited tumour necrosis factor-alpha protein and mRNA levels in A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells; a concentration of 6.8 microM was required for a 50% reduction. In addition, all concentrations of this compound that we tested also inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression. The mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 in A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells treated with natsudaidain were also markedly decreased. The phosphorylated-p38 MAPK protein levels in A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells treated with natsudaidain were lower than in the non-treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that natsudaidain inhibits tumour necrosis factor-alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 production by suppressing p38 MAPK phosphorylation but not p65 NFkappaB phosphorylation, and that natsudaidain might alleviate inflammatory diseases.","['Matsui, Takuya', 'Ito, Chihiro', 'Itoigawa, Masataka', 'Okada, Tadashi', 'Furukawa, Hiroshi']","['Matsui T', 'Ito C', 'Itoigawa M', 'Okada T', 'Furukawa H']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. tmatsui@aichi-med-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Flavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '35154-55-3 (natsudaidain)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'D65ILJ7WLY (nobiletin)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrus/*chemistry', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flavones/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Immunoblotting', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1211/jpp/61.01.0015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2009 Jan;61(1):109-14. doi: 10.1211/jpp/61.01.0015.,10.1211/jpp/61.01.0015 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In elucidating the mechanisms of growth inhibition, a special emphasis was placed on assessing the induction of differentiation and apoptosis by andrographolide in the primary acute promyelocytic leukaemia NB4 cells. KEY FINDINGS: The compound was 2- and 3-fold more active in inhibiting the growth of HL-60 and NB4-R2 cells compared with NB4 cells, respectively. At IC50 (concentration at which growth of 50% of the cells (compared with medium only treated control cells) is inhibited; 4.5 microM) the compound exhibited strong cell-differentiating activity in NB4 cells, similar to ATRA (IC50 1.5 microM). In the presence of a pure retinoic acid receptor antagonist AGN193109, the growth inhibition of NB4 cells by ATRA was reversed, whereas the activity of andrographolide was not affected. This clearly suggested that andrographolide's cell differentiating activity to induce growth inhibition of NB4 cells most likely occurred via a retinoic acid receptor-independent pathway. At higher concentration (2xIC50), andrographolide was an efficient inducer of apoptosis in NB4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest andrographolide and its derivatives, apparently with a novel cell differentiating mechanism and with ability to induce apoptosis, might be beneficial in the treatment of primary and ATRA-resistant acute promyelocytic leukaemia.","['Manikam, Shiamala D', 'Stanslas, Johnson']","['Manikam SD', 'Stanslas J']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '410105JHGR (andrographolide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZC6062V1O9 (AGN 193109)']",IM,"['Andrographis/chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthalenes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/pharmacology']",2009/01/08 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/01/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1211/jpp/61.01.0010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2009 Jan;61(1):69-78. doi: 10.1211/jpp/61.01.0010.,10.1211/jpp/61.01.0010 [doi],,,,,"['J Pharm Pharmacol. 2009 May;61(5):687.

There is accumulating evidence that circulating endothelial cells (CECs) play an important role in angiogenesis. The aim of our study was to compare the number of CECs in peripheral blood of CLL patients and healthy donors and to correlate these numbers with bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) and known prognostic factors in CLL. Proportions of resting CECs (rCECs), activated CECs (aCECs), apoptotic CECs (apoCECs) and circulating precursor endothelial cells (CPECs) were estimated by flow cytometry in 104 untreated CLL patients and 29 healthy blood donors. The MVD was analysed in the bone marrow biopsy in 21 CLL patients and 11 controls using the 'hot spot analysis' of vessels' density (x200 HPS). We found significantly higher numbers of CPECs, rCECs, aCECs and apoCECs in CLL patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Furthermore, the rCECs number was higher in advanced versus low clinical stage CLL (median 17.5 cells/microL vs. 13.5 cells/microL, p = 0.05). The MVD was significantly higher in the bone marrow of CLL patients when compared with controls (p = 0.016). However, we did not find any correlation between MVD and different CECs populations. In conclusion, the number of CECs is increased in CLL and correlates with stage of the disease, but does not seem to directly reflect the intensity of neovascularisaton in the bone marrow.","['Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Krawczynska, Anna', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka', 'Jesionek-Kupnicka, Dorota', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Gora-Tybor J', 'Jamroziak K', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Krawczynska A', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Wierzbowska A', 'Jesionek-Kupnicka D', 'Blonski JZ', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply', '*Cell Movement', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*blood/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/03/05 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [medline]']","['907393916 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802549883 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jan;50(1):62-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190802549883.,10.1080/10428190802549883 [doi],,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jan;50(1):8-9.

Tropical habitats such as those found in Malaysia are attractive sources of new therapeutic compounds as tremendous chemical diversity is found in a large number of plants, animals, marine- and micro-organisms. In our screening program for novel photosensitizers from nature, colorful strains of fungi (from Aspergillus and Penicillium genus) and bacteria (including actinomycetes and photosynthetic bacteria) were collected from various habitats in Peninsular Malaysia, such as coastal soil, peat soil, marine sponges and wastewater ponds. Methanolic extracts from a total of 85 different species were evaluated with a short-term cell viability assay for photo-cytotoxicity, where a promyelocytic leukemia cell-line, HL60 incubated with 20 microg/ml of extracts was irradiated with 9.6 J/cm(2) of a broad spectrum light. Two of these extracts, one from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (PBUM003) and one from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (PBUM001) showed moderate to strong photo-cytotoxicity. Subsequent bioassay guided isolation of the PBUM001 extract yielded known photosensitisers that are based on bacteriochlorophyll-a by comparing their molecular weight data, HPLC profiles and UV-vis absorption spectra with literature values, thereby demonstrating the validity of our screening approach.","['Kamal, Nurkhalida', 'Sabaratnam, Vikineswary', 'Abdullah, Noorlidah', 'Ho, Anthony S H', 'Teo, Soo H', 'Lee, Hong B']","['Kamal N', 'Sabaratnam V', 'Abdullah N', 'Ho AS', 'Teo SH', 'Lee HB']","['Cancer Research Initiatives Foundation (CARIF), Level 2 Outpatient Centre, Subang Jaya Medical Centre, No 1 Jalan SS12/1A, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,0372625,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Bacteria/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fungi/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Malaysia', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Porifera/*microbiology', '*Soil Microbiology', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', '*Water Microbiology']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10482-008-9301-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 2009 Feb;95(2):179-88. doi: 10.1007/s10482-008-9301-8.

The experiences and coping strategies used were viewed from the gender perspective. Two in-depth interviews scheduled to coincide with the disease trajectory of acute lymphocytic leukemia were conducted with 9 fathers, and data were analyzed using the matrix system described by Miles and Huberman. Four categories were identified, including fathers' initial reactions to the child's confirmed diagnosis, the decision to disclose the child's diagnosis to others, social support of the fathers, and their effective coping mechanisms. Previous research has shown that men are expected to be emotionally strong to support their spouse. Findings from this study indicate that Hong Kong Chinese fathers need emotional support especially at the onset of the child's diagnosis. Implications for healthcare professionals include the need for ongoing psychosocial support and education over the course of the child's illness. Thus, assessment of the different coping strategies used by the fathers plays a vital role in providing quality care to these fathers.

This study was conducted to determine whether low-intensity laser therapy (LLLT) can reduce the duration of chemotherapy-induced OM. PROCEDURE: A placebo-controlled randomized trial was carried out using LLLT or placebo (sham treatment). Children and adolescents with cancer receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation between October 2005 and May 2006 were eligible as soon as they developed OM. Patients received intervention for 5 days. The LLLT group was treated with laser GaAlAs, wavelength (lambda): 830 nm (infrared), power: 100 mW, dose: 4 J/cm, and placebo group underwent sham treatment. The grade of OM was clinically assessed by the National Cancer Institute, Common Toxicity Criteria scale. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients developed OM and were evaluable for analysis; 18 (86%) patients had a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma and 3(14%) had solid tumors. The mean age was 8.2 (+/-3.1) years. Nine patients were randomized in the laser group and 12 in the placebo-control group. Once OM was diagnosed, the patients had daily OM grading assessments before laser or sham application and thereafter until complete healing of the lesions. On day 7 after OM diagnosis, 1/9 of patients remained with lesions in laser group and 9/12 of patients in the placebo-control group (P=0.029). In the laser group, the mean of OM duration was 5.8+/-2 days and in the placebo group was 8.9+/-2.4 days (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown evidence that laser therapy in addition to oral care can decrease the duration of chemotherapy-induced OM. Our results confirm the promising results observed in adult cancer patients and should encourage pediatric oncologists to use laser therapy as first-line option in children with chemotherapy-induced OM.","['Kuhn, Alessandra', 'Porto, Fernanda Antola', 'Miraglia, Patricia', 'Brunetto, Algemir Lunardi']","['Kuhn A', 'Porto FA', 'Miraglia P', 'Brunetto AL']","['Pediatric Oncology Unit, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. alessandrakuhn@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infrared Rays', '*Low-Level Light Therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Stomatitis/*chemically induced/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/02/06 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318192cb8e [doi]', '00043426-200901000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jan;31(1):33-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318192cb8e.,10.1097/MPH.0b013e318192cb8e [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal dosing of vancomycin in this patient population has not been well established. METHODS: All pediatric oncology and SCT patients receiving vancomycin between October 2006 and March 2007 were included in this study. Therapeutic levels were defined as levels between 10 and 15 mg/dL and low therapeutic levels were between 5 and 9 mg/dL. Information regarding any recent or concurrent nephrotoxic medications was collected. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients received 82 courses of vancomycin during the study period. More patients (53.7%) received vancomycin for empiric therapy and 78% had recent or concurrent use of nephrotoxic medications. Using standardized vancomycin dosing guided by a computerized provider order entry system, there were significantly more patients who were in the subtherapeutic range than the supratherapeutic range (P=0.0023). There were also significantly more patients in the low therapeutic than the therapeutic range (P<0.0001). A small number of courses (3.5%) were associated with supratherapeutic levels. There was no association between the concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medications and vancomycin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric oncology and SCT patients with normal renal function require higher daily vancomycin doses than other pediatric patients.","['Piro, Christina C', 'Crossno, Christine L', 'Collier, Anderson', 'Ho, Richard', 'Koyama, Tatsuki', 'Frangoul, Haydar']","['Piro CC', 'Crossno CL', 'Collier A', 'Ho R', 'Koyama T', 'Frangoul H']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, Nashville, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bacteremia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vancomycin/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/02/06 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31818b3520 [doi]', '00043426-200901000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jan;31(1):3-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31818b3520.,10.1097/MPH.0b013e31818b3520 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that accelerated telomere shortening after aHCT could contribute to the development of t-MDS/AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort was constructed to investigate the sequence of cellular and molecular abnormalities leading to development of t-MDS/AML after aHCT for HL/NHL. This cohort formed the sampling frame for a nested case-control study to compare changes in telomere length in serial blood samples from patients who developed t-MDS/AML with matched controls who did not develop t-MDS/AML. RESULTS: An initial increase in telomere length at day 100 after aHCT was followed by an accelerated telomere shortening in t-MDS/AML patients when compared with controls. These telomere alterations preceded the onset of t-MDS and were independent of other known risk factors associated with development of t-MDS/AML on multivariate analysis. Additionally, we observed reduced generation of committed progenitors in patients who developed t-MDS/AML, indicating that these telomere alterations were associated with reduced regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells. CONCLUSION: The development of t-MDS/AML after aHCT is associated with and preceded by markedly altered telomere dynamics in hematopoietic cells. Accelerated telomere loss in patients developing t-MDS/AML may reflect increased clonal proliferation and/or altered telomere regulation in premalignant cells. Genetic instability associated with shortened telomeres may contribute to leukemic transformation in t-MDS/AML.","['Chakraborty, Sujata', 'Sun, Can-Lan', 'Francisco, Liton', 'Sabado, Melanie', 'Li, Liang', 'Chang, Karen L', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Chakraborty S', 'Sun CL', 'Francisco L', 'Sabado M', 'Li L', 'Chang KL', 'Forman S', 'Bhatia S', 'Bhatia R']","['Department of Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Division of Population Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*genetics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Telomere/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/02/27 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.17.1033 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.1033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 10;27(5):791-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.1033.

Thus, the aim of the present phase II study was to test a pediatric-inspired treatment, including intensified doses of nonmyelotoxic drugs, such as prednisone, vincristine, or L-asparaginase, in adult patients with ALL up to the age of 60 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, 225 adult patients (median age, 31 years; range, 15 to 60 years) with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL were enrolled onto the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2003 protocol, which included several pediatric options. Some adult options, such as allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with high-risk ALL, were nevertheless retained. RESULTS: were retrospectively compared with the historical France-Belgium Group for Lymphoblastic Acute Leukemia in Adults 94 (LALA-94) trial experience in 712 patients age 15 to 55 years. Results Complete remission rate was 93.5%. At 42 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 55% (95% CI, 48% to 52%) and 60% (95% CI, 53% to 66%), respectively. Age remained an important bad prognostic factor, with 45 years of age as best cutoff. In older versus younger patients, there was a higher cumulative incidence of chemotherapy-related deaths (23% v 5%, respectively; P < .001) and deaths in first CR (22% v 5%, respectively; P < .001), whereas the incidence of relapse remained stable (30% v 32%, respectively). Complete remission rate (P = .02), EFS (P < .001), and OS (P < .001) compared favorably with the previous LALA-94 experience. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pediatric-inspired therapy markedly improves the outcome of adult patients with ALL, at least until the age of 45 years.","['Huguet, Francoise', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Delannoy, Andre', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Vernant, Jean-Paul', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Chassevent, Agnes', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Huguet F', 'Leguay T', 'Raffoux E', 'Thomas X', 'Beldjord K', 'Delabesse E', 'Chevallier P', 'Buzyn A', 'Delannoy A', 'Chalandon Y', 'Vernant JP', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Chassevent A', 'Lheritier V', 'Macintyre E', 'Bene MC', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.6916 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.6916 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 20;27(6):911-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.6916.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Rel A DNA binding was quantified in nuclear extracts derived from 131 unselected CLL patient samples using a quantitative DNA-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based method. We then investigated the ability of Rel A to predict for the requirement for treatment and survival and compared our findings with other established prognostic markers. RESULTS: Rel A DNA binding was strongly associated with advanced Binet stage (P < .0001) but did not correlate with immunoglobulin V(H) (IgV(H)) mutation status (P = .25), CD38 expression (P = .87), or zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) expression (P = .55). It was predictive of time to first treatment (P = .02) and time to subsequent treatment (P = .0001). In addition, Rel A was the most predictive marker of survival both from date of diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 9.1; P = .01) and date of entry into the study (HR, 3.9; P = .05) and retained prognostic significance in multivariate analysis for both time to first treatment and overall survival in the presence of Binet stage, IgV(H) mutation status, CD38, and ZAP-70. CONCLUSION: Rel A is an independent prognostic marker of survival in CLL and seems to have the unique capacity to predict the duration of response to therapy. Prospective assessment of Rel A as a marker of clinical outcome and as a therapeutic target are now warranted.","['Hewamana, Saman', 'Lin, Thet Thet', 'Rowntree, Clare', 'Karunanithi, Kamaraj', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Hills, Robert', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Hewamana S', 'Lin TT', 'Rowntree C', 'Karunanithi K', 'Pratt G', 'Hills R', 'Fegan C', 'Brennan P', 'Pepper C']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/02/27 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.1114 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.1114 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 10;27(5):763-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.1114.

To gain insights into molecular mechanisms governing cell fate, we examined the patterns of proteins up-regulated following stimulation of Ba/F3 cells with IL-3. Through two-dimensional electrophoresis and proteomics-based approaches, we identified 11 proteins. Of these, expression of 14-3-3gamma was significantly increased by IL-3 stimulation at both the transcriptional and translational levels. 14-3-3gamma overexpression in Ba/F3 cells abrogated dependence on IL-3 and was associated with activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling cascades, suggesting that the functions of 14-3-3gamma in normal hematopoietic progenitors are to promote survival and growth through the activation of distinct signaling pathways. Additionally, the up-regulation of Bax and Bad was seen with the ablation of 14-3-3gamma, resulting in cell death.

Pax2 transactivation domain interaction protein (PTIP), a protein that contains six BRCT domains, has been implicated in DNA damage response. In this study we showed that recruitment of PTIP to damaged chromatin depends on DNA damage signaling proteins gammaH2AX.MDC1.RNF8, which in turn facilitates sustained localization of PA1 (PTIP-associated protein 1) to sites of DNA break. Similar to PTIP, depletion of PA1 increases cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the N-terminal PA1 binding domain and the C-terminal focus-localization domain of PTIP are critical for PTIP function in DNA damage repair. Interestingly, although PTIP and PA1 associate with MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) complexes and participate in transcriptional regulation, this function of PTIP.PA1 in DNA damage response is likely to be independent of the MLL complexes. Taken together, we propose that a subset of PTIP.PA1 complex is recruited to DNA damage sites via the RNF8-dependent pathway and is required for cell survival in response to DNA damage.","['Gong, Zihua', 'Cho, Young-Wook', 'Kim, Ja-Eun', 'Ge, Kai', 'Chen, Junjie']","['Gong Z', 'Cho YW', 'Kim JE', 'Ge K', 'Chen J']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MDC1 protein, human)', '0 (MDC1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Paxip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNF8 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (gamma-H2AX protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Survival/genetics/radiation effects', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks/*radiation effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gamma Rays', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32611-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M809158200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 13;284(11):7284-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M809158200.

Cantharidin, a natural toxin from blister beetles, used as medicinal agent since antiquity, has been described to modulate the HLF competitor NFIL3 and is under clinical evaluation as an antitumor and antimetastatic agent. The molecule is not a substrate for multidrug resistant pumps and does not cause myelosuppression, and therefore it represents a promising compound for selective ablation of LSCs. Cantharidin and norcantharidin, a derivative with reduced toxicity, decreased HLF protein levels and induced apoptosis in the AML cell line MV4-11 by modulating the expression of several molecules that govern survival pathway, including HLF, SLUG, NFIL3 and c-myc, thereby inducing p53 and the mitochondrial caspase cascade. In vitro, cantharidin readily targeted primary AML stem and progenitor cells in contrast to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as Ara-C and daunorubicin, that mainly targeted more differentiated leukemic cells. In vitro the compound did not exhibit a therapeutic window, being equally toxic to normal HSCs and LSCs. In vivo cantharidin did not produce myelosuppression. Because of dose-limiting toxicity in vivo, neither cantharidin nor norcantharidin proved therapeutical benefit in AML xenograft models as a single agent. However, its potent in vitro LSC activity and pathway targeting may still be exploited clinically with a new generation of cantharidin derivatives or formulations and with appropriate drug combinations.","['Dorn, David C', 'Kou, Cynthia A', 'Png, Kim J', 'Moore, Malcolm A S']","['Dorn DC', 'Kou CA', 'Png KJ', 'Moore MA']","['Moore Laboratory, Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. dornd@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NFIL3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SNAI1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Snai2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8452E71EO7 (norcantharidin)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IGL471WQ8P (Cantharidin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cantharidin/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Luminescence', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2009/01/07 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2009/01/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24157 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 May 1;124(9):2186-99. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24157.,10.1002/ijc.24157 [doi],,"['P01 CA59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL61401/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

The results support the formation of complexes of the formula Co(ofo)2 x 4H2O (II) and Ni(ofo)2 x 4H2O (III). The infrared spectra of the isolated solid complexes suggested that ofo acts as bidentate ligands through one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group and the ring carbonyl oxygen atom.

This study evaluated the role of palliative radiotherapy in the management of incurable paediatric malignancies. METHODS: Records of 40 paediatric patients treated between January 2003 and November 2005 were reviewed and analysed retrospectively. All had received palliative external beam radiotherapy for symptom control either as a single modality or in addition to surgery, chemotherapy and drugs for symptomatic relief. RESULTS: Predominant symptoms noticed were swelling with or without pain, bleeding, and weakness of limbs. Median duration of symptoms was 90 days. Malignant round cell tumours were most common followed by retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and acute myeloid leukaemia with chloromas. 45 percent of children had disseminated disease at presentation. Nine underwent surgery, while 32 patients received chemotherapy, and all but two received drugs for symptomatic relief in addition to palliative radiotherapy. Dose schedules were either 5 Gy or 8 Gy in single fraction, while for fractionated radiotherapy, the range was 20 Gy in five fractions to 30 Gy in ten fractions. With regard to symptomatic relief, four patients had complete relief, 20 showed good relief, 15 had little and one did not have any relief. On completion of multimodality treatment, tumour response was complete in two patients, 18 had partial response, eight had stable disease, eight had progressive disease, and the disease status of four was unknown. CONCLUSION: The role of radiotherapy as a palliative modality in children with locally-advanced lesions provides better symptomatic relief in combination with other treatment modalities.","['Bhasker, S', 'Bajpai, V', 'Turaka, A']","['Bhasker S', 'Bajpai V', 'Turaka A']","['Department of Radiotherapy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India. bhaskersuman@rediffmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*radiotherapy', '*Palliative Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/05/01 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2008 Dec;49(12):998-1001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A defining characteristic of stem cells is their capacity to self-renew, which is markedly extended in leukaemia stem cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 is indispensable for maintaining self-renewal of leukaemia stem cells. Expression of leukaemia-associated oncogenes in mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) induces DNA damage and activates a p21-dependent cellular response, which leads to reversible cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair. Activated p21 is critical in preventing excess DNA-damage accumulation and functional exhaustion of leukaemic stem cells. These data unravel the oncogenic potential of p21 and suggest that inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms might function as potent strategy for the eradication of the slowly proliferating leukaemia stem cells.","['Viale, Andrea', 'De Franco, Francesca', 'Orleth, Annette', 'Cambiaghi, Valeria', 'Giuliani, Virginia', 'Bossi, Daniela', 'Ronchini, Chiara', 'Ronzoni, Simona', 'Muradore, Ivan', 'Monestiroli, Silvia', 'Gobbi, Alberto', 'Alcalay, Myriam', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Viale A', 'De Franco F', 'Orleth A', 'Cambiaghi V', 'Giuliani V', 'Bossi D', 'Ronchini C', 'Ronzoni S', 'Muradore I', 'Monestiroli S', 'Gobbi A', 'Alcalay M', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology at the IFOM-IEO Campus, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20141 Milan, Italy. andrea.viale@ifom-ieo-campus.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2008/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]']","['nature07618 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07618 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Jan 1;457(7225):51-6. doi: 10.1038/nature07618.,10.1038/nature07618 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk (a broad-caspase inhibitor) almost completely suppressed 3-OA-induced DNA ladder formation and hypodiploid DNA contents, thereby implicating the caspase cascade in the apoptotic process. In addition, z-IETD-fmk (a caspase-8 inhibitor) and z-DEVD-fmk (a caspase-3 inhibitor) also completely neutralized the apoptotic effect of 3-OA in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, 3-OA increased Fas-related protein contents and the mRNA expressions of Fas ligand (FasL), Fas, and Fas-associated death domain (FADD). Preincubation with anti-Fas or anti-FasL blocking antibodies completely prevented 3-OA-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid induces apoptosis by activating caspase-8 via FasL-stimulated death receptor signaling.","['Kim, Sung-Su', 'Won, So-Jung', 'Kim, Nam Jae', 'Yoo, Jae Kuk', 'Bae, KiHwan', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Kim SS', 'Won SJ', 'Kim NJ', 'Yoo JK', 'Bae K', 'Lee KT']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (HABP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Saxifragaceae/*chemistry', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Time Factors', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/04/16 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/32.91 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.32.91 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2009 Jan;32(1):91-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.32.91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that treatment of HeLa cells with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A, or small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression of HDAC3, enhances phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was restored by treatment of cells with HDAC3 siRNA. We further found that formation of a complex between STAT3 and PP2A was enhanced in the presence of HDAC3. Importantly, small-interfering RNA-mediated repression of both HDAC3 and PP2A effectively enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3 activation. These results indicate that HDAC3 may act as a scaffold protein for PP2A to regulate the LIF/STAT3-mediated signaling pathway.","['Togi, Sumihito', 'Kamitani, Shinya', 'Kawakami, Shiho', 'Ikeda, Osamu', 'Muromoto, Ryuta', 'Nanbo, Asuka', 'Matsuda, Tadashi']","['Togi S', 'Kamitani S', 'Kawakami S', 'Ikeda O', 'Muromoto R', 'Nanbo A', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-Ku Kita 12 Nishi 6, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2008/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(08)02555-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Feb 6;379(2):616-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.132.

NAC1 is a POZ/BTB motif containing transcriptional repressor protein. In a mammalian two hybrid assay in neuronal (N2A) cells and non-neuronal (HEK 293T) cells, VP16 activation domain tagged NAC1 resulted in significant reversal of transcriptional inhibition with the Gal4-ZID, Gal4-BCL6, Gal4-ZF5, and kelch proteins Gal4-MAYVEN and Gal4-NRP/B fusion proteins. We also observed similar results with another corepressor, BCoR Gal4 fusion protein. NAC1 potentiated ZF5 mediated repression in Gal4-DBD fusion transient assays. GST pulldown assays further confirmed protein-protein interactions between these proteins and NAC1. Both the NAC1 isoforms demonstrated selective interaction through the POZ/BTB domain but not with the non-POZ/BTB region. Endogenous NAC1 and BCL6 physically associated in CNS regions. Strikingly, NAC1 did not interact with the pro-myelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), another POZ/BTB protein that is not found in the adult brain. Therefore, we conclude that NAC1 functions as a corepressor for POZ/BTB proteins expressed in the mature CNS.","['Korutla, Laxminarayana', 'Wang, Peijie', 'Jackson, Trevor G', 'Mackler, Scott A']","['Korutla L', 'Wang P', 'Jackson TG', 'Mackler SA']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Neurochem Int,Neurochemistry international,8006959,"['0 (BCOR protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NACC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nacc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0197-0186(08)00196-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuint.2008.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurochem Int. 2009 Mar-Apr;54(3-4):245-52. doi: 10.1016/j.neuint.2008.12.008.

Clinically, paediatric AML-M4/M5 has been considered as an intermediate or undefined prognostic group. In this study, we analysed gene expression of 40 paediatric AML-M4/M5 patients excluding inv(16) and t(8;21) patients, and found striking differences among the patients in an age-associated manner. In particular, most of the infants displayed very distinct gene expression. On the basis of this difference, we divided paediatric patients into three subgroups (A, B and C) with the average age of 0.3, 3.1 and 6.6 years old respectively. All subgroups included patients with MLL gene rearrangement as well as normal and other karyotypes. Surprisingly, gene expression signatures of MLL gene rearrangement differed substantially among these subgroups. In addition, subgroup C presented extremely poor outcome (3-year event-free survival 28%) whilst eight patients with MLL gene rearrangement in subgroup C had all relapsed within 18 months. These results suggest that age is an important factor contributing to the biology of AML-M4/M5 and the sub-grouping procedures developed in this study could be a powerful tool to identify unfavourable risk patients within paediatric AML-M4/M5.","['Jo, Aoi', 'Tsukimoto, Ichiro', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Mitani, Sachiyo', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Igarashi, Takashi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Ichikawa, Hitoshi']","['Jo A', 'Tsukimoto I', 'Ishii E', 'Asou N', 'Mitani S', 'Shimada A', 'Igarashi T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Ichikawa H']","['Genetics Division, National Cancer Centre Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7531 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07531.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Mar;144(6):917-29. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07531.x.

There are two major subtypes of CN as judged by inheritance: an autosomal dominant subtype, e.g. defined by neutrophil elastase mutations (approximately 60% of patients) and an autosomal recessive subtype (approximately 30% of patients), both presenting with the same clinical and morphological phenotype. Different mutations have been described (e.g. HAX1, p14 etc) in autosomal recessive CN, with HAX1 mutations in the majority of these patients. CN in common is considered as a preleukemic syndrome, since the cumulative incidence for leukemia is more than 25% after 20 years of observation. Leukemias occur in both, the autosomal dominant and recessive subtypes of CN. The individual risk for each genetic subtype needs to be further evaluated. Numbers of patients tested for the underlying genetic defect are still limited. Acquired G-CSFR (CSF3R) mutations are detected in approximately 80% of CN patients who developed acute myeloid leukemia independent of the ELA2 or HAX1 genetic subtype, suggesting that these mutations are involved in leukemogenesis. As the majority of patients benefit from G-CSF administration, HSCT should be restricted to non-responders and patients with leukaemic transformation.","['Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Germeshausen, Manuela', 'Klein, Christoph', 'Welte, Karl']","['Zeidler C', 'Germeshausen M', 'Klein C', 'Welte K']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Medical University Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (HAX1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.71 (pancreatic elastase II)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Child', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', '*Mutation', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*genetics/physiopathology/therapy', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7425 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07425.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Feb;144(4):459-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07425.x.

In the present study, we investigated 36 cases of high hyperdiploid (>50 chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with methylation-specific multiplex ligase-dependent probe amplification to determine the extent of aberrant methylation in this subgroup. The analysis, which comprised the promoters of 35 known tumour suppressor genes, showed that 16 genes displayed abnormal methylation in at least one case each. The highest number of methylated gene promoters seen in a single case was thirteen, with all but one case displaying methylation for at least one gene. The most common targets were ESR1 (29/36 cases; 81%), CADM1 (IGSF4, TSLC1; 25/36 cases; 69%), FHIT (24/36 cases; 67%) and RARB (22/36 cases; 61%). Interestingly, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that although methylation of the CADM1 and RARB promoters resulted in the expected pattern of downregulation of the respective genes, no difference could be detected in FHIT expression between methylation-positive and -negative cases. Furthermore, TIMP3 was not expressed regardless of methylation status, showing that aberrant methylation does not always lead to gene expression changes. Taken together, our findings suggest that aberrant methylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters is a common phenomenon in high hyperdiploid ALL.","['Paulsson, Kajsa', 'An, Qian', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Parker, Helen', 'Molloy, Gael', 'Davies, Teresa', 'Griffiths, Mike', 'Ross, Fiona M', 'Irving, Julie', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Young, Bryan D', 'Strefford, Jon C']","['Paulsson K', 'An Q', 'Moorman AV', 'Parker H', 'Molloy G', 'Davies T', 'Griffiths M', 'Ross FM', 'Irving J', 'Harrison CJ', 'Young BD', 'Strefford JC']","['Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary College, London, UK. kajsa.paulsson@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/01/06 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7523 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07523.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Mar;144(6):838-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07523.x.

METHOD: A retrospective analysis of 123 case with small round cell tumor of nasal sinus and bases of skull were carried out in our hospital in past ten year. Clinical, histological, radiological and immunohistochemical characters of these cases were studied. RESULT: All cases usually complained of nasal obstruction, headache, diplopia, nasal mucus with bleeding, vision or weight loss. Expansible or infiltrative lumps were found in nasal sinus or bases of skull in radiological examination. A lot of small round cells were found in these tumors in histological pathology. At least 5-6 cell, tissue or tumor markers were examined immunohistochemically in most of cases before the final diagnosis were made. In some cases over 20 markers were examined. Five cases were carried out transmission electron microscope examination, special features such as desmosome and myofilament were found. CONCLUSION: Clinical symptom, physical signs and radiological finding can supply malignant evidences of these tumors. Histological examination can make certain that they are small round cell tumors, but final diagnosis is still hard to make only by these. Immunohistochemical examination of various markers can tell the original characters of the specimen tissues, it is the key for final diagnosis. Transmission electron microscope examination is another helpful way for diagnosis.","['Lei, Wenbin', 'Su, Zhenzhong', 'Wen, Weiping', 'Shi, Jianbo', 'Liao, Bing', 'Wu, Xingchen', 'Xu, Geng']","['Lei W', 'Su Z', 'Wen W', 'Shi J', 'Liao B', 'Wu X', 'Xu G']","['Otorhinolaryngology Hospital, Otorhinolaryngology Institute, the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Lin Chung Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,"Lin chuang er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Journal of clinical otorhinolaryngology, head, and neck surgery",101303164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skull Base Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2009/01/06 09:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2009/01/06 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Lin Chung Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Oct;22(20):929-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 3-yr-old Korean girl with Down syndrome was admitted to our hospital complaining of pallor and fever. The findings of a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow study were compatible with the presence of AMKL. A chromosome study showed 48,XX,-7,+21c,+21,+r[3]/47,XX,+21c[17]. Following GATA1 gene mutation analysis, a novel mutation, c.145dupG (p.Ala49GlyfsX18), was identified in the N-terminal activation domain of the GATA1 gene. This mutation caused a premature termination at codon 67 and expression of an abnormal GATA-1 protein with a defective N-terminal activation domain, and the absence of full-length GATA-1 protein. This case demonstrates that a leukemogenic mechanism for DS-AMKL is contributed by a unique collaboration between overexpressed genes from trisomy 21 and an acquired GATA1 mutation previously seen in Caucasians and now in a Korean patient.","['Kim, In-Suk', 'Park, Eun Sil', 'Lim, Jae Young', 'Ki, Chang-Seok', 'Chi, Hyun Sook']","['Kim IS', 'Park ES', 'Lim JY', 'Ki CS', 'Chi HS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Jinju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Korea', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Trisomy']",2009/01/03 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/01/03 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2008.23.6.1105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2008 Dec;23(6):1105-8. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2008.23.6.1105.

The authors investigated whether families with one or more members affected by orofacial clefts (that is, families segregating orofacial clefts) had an increased cancer incidence when compared with control families. METHODS: The authors assessed 75 white families with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and 93 white control families regarding a history of cancer. They used chi(2) and Fisher exact tests to determine significant differences. They then performed molecular studies with genes in which mutations have been independently associated with both cancer and craniofacial anomalies in a total of 111 families with CL/P. RESULTS: The families with CL/P reported a family history of cancer more often than did control families (P <.001), and they had higher rates of specific cancer types: colon (P <.001), brain (P = .003), leukemia (P = .005), breast (P = .009), prostate (P = .01), skin (P = .01), lung (P = .02) and liver (P = .02). The authors detected overtransmission of AXIS inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2) in CL/P probands (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Families segregating CL/P may have an increased susceptibility to cancer, notably colon cancer. Furthermore, AXIN2, a gene that when mutated increases susceptibility to colon cancer, also is associated with CL/P. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: People who are at a higher risk of developing disease need to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including avoiding exposure to risk factors that may interact with their genotypes.","['Menezes, Renato', 'Marazita, Mary Louise', 'Goldstein McHenry, Toby', 'Cooper, Margaret E', 'Bardi, Kathleen', 'Brandon, Carla', 'Letra, Ariadne', 'Martin, Rick A', 'Vieira, Alexandre Rezende']","['Menezes R', 'Marazita ML', 'Goldstein McHenry T', 'Cooper ME', 'Bardi K', 'Brandon C', 'Letra A', 'Martin RA', 'Vieira AR']","['Department of Oral Biology and Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Am Dent Assoc,Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),7503060,"['0 (AXIN2 protein, human)', '0 (Axin Protein)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)']",IM,"['Axin Protein', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cleft Lip/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cleft Palate/genetics/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Family Health', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors']",2009/01/03 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/03 09:00'],"['2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['S0002-8177(14)64829-7 [pii]', '10.14219/jada.archive.2009.0022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Dent Assoc. 2009 Jan;140(1):80-4. doi: 10.14219/jada.archive.2009.0022.,,,"['R01 DE016148/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'K99-DE018413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 DE018413-01A1/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 DE018954/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 DE018954-02/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 DE018413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-DE016215/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 DE018413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DE016148/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-DE016718/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2945901,,,,,['NIHMS71199'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We purified the AAF heterodimer composed of 44- and 132-kDa subunits from cultured cells and identified full-length cDNA clones using amino acid sequences from internal peptides. AAF-132 demonstrated no homologies to known proteins; AAF-44, however, is evolutionarily related to the 32-kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA-32) and contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain similar to the OB fold domains of RPA involved in single-stranded DNA binding. Epitope-tagged versions of AAF-44 and -132 formed a complex in intact cells, and purified recombinant AAF-44 bound to single-stranded DNA and stimulated DNA primase activity only in the presence of AAF-132. Mutations in conserved residues within the OB fold of AAF-44 reduced DNA binding activity of the AAF-44.AAF-132 complex. Immunofluorescence staining of AAF-44 and AAF-132 in S phase-enriched HeLa cells demonstrated punctate nuclear staining, and AAF co-localized with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a marker for replication foci containing DNA polymerase-alpha.primase and RPA. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of AAF-44 in tumor cell lines inhibited [methyl-(3)H]thymidine uptake into DNA but did not affect cell viability. We conclude that AAF shares structural and functional similarities with RPA-32 and regulates DNA replication, consistent with its ability to increase polymerase-alpha.primase template affinity and stimulate both DNA primase and polymerase-alpha activities in vitro.","['Casteel, Darren E', 'Zhuang, Shunhui', 'Zeng, Ying', 'Perrino, Fred W', 'Boss, Gerry R', 'Goulian, Mehran', 'Pilz, Renate B']","['Casteel DE', 'Zhuang S', 'Zeng Y', 'Perrino FW', 'Boss GR', 'Goulian M', 'Pilz RB']","['Department of Medicine and Cancer Center of the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA polymerase alpha-primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Polymerase I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primase/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Replication', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Replication Protein A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2009/01/03 09:00,2009/05/12 09:00,['2009/01/03 09:00'],"['2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)70905-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M807593200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Feb 27;284(9):5807-18. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M807593200.

There is considerable controversy in the literature about whether or not vasculitis is a histopathologic requirement to establish the diagnosis of erythema induratum of Bazin. Even accepting vasculitis as a histopathologic criterion, there is no agreement about the nature and size of the involved vessels. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of our study was to investigate whether or not vasculitis was present in a large series of cases of erythema induratum of Bazin and, when vasculitis was found, to determine the nature and localization of the involved vessels. METHODS: We studied 101 skin biopsy specimens from 86 patients with clinicopathologic diagnosis of erythema induratum of Bazin. Histopathologic criteria required in each case to be included in this study were: (1) a mostly lobular panniculitis with necrotic adipocytes at the center of the fat lobule; (2) inflammatory infiltrate within the fat lobule mostly composed of neutrophils in early lesions and granulomatous infiltrate in fully developed lesions; (3) significant fat necrosis; and (4) absence of other histopathologic findings that allow a specific diagnosis of other lobular panniculitis different from erythema induratum of Bazin. We also recorded the nature of the inflammatory cells involving the fat lobule, and the lesions were classified into two main categories: (1) early lesions, when the inflammatory infiltrate was mainly composed of neutrophils, with or without leukocytoclasis; and (2) fully developed lesions, when histiocytes and lipophages were the predominant inflammatory cells within the involved fat lobule. RESULTS: Some type of vasculitis was evident in 91 cases (90.09%). A total of 47 biopsy specimens (46.5%) showed a mostly lobular panniculitis with necrotizing vasculitis involving the small vessels, probably venules, of the center of the fat lobule. Thirteen biopsy specimens (12.8%) showed a mostly lobular panniculitis with vasculitis involving both large septal veins and small vessels, probably venules, of the center of the fat lobule. Twelve biopsy specimens (11.8%) showed a mostly lobular panniculitis with vasculitis involving large septal veins, with no involvement or other septal or lobular vessels. Ten biopsy specimens (9.9%) showed a mostly lobular panniculitis with vasculitis involving large septal vessels, both arteries and veins, and necrotizing vasculitis involving the small vessels, probably venules, of the center of the fat lobule. Nine biopsy specimens (8.9%) showed a mostly lobular panniculitis with vasculitis involving large septal vessels, both arteries and veins, but with no involvement of the small blood vessels of the center of the fat lobule. Finally, 10 biopsy specimens (9.9%) showed a mostly lobular panniculitis without evidence of septal or lobular vasculitis in serial sections. Associated diseases included history of extracutaneous tuberculosis (including tuberculosis of the lung, lymph nodes, kidney, or bowel) in 12 cases (13.95%), previous episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis of the lower legs in 3 cases (3.72%), rheumatoid arthritis in one case (1.16%), Crohn disease in one case (1.16%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia in two cases (2.32%), hypothyroidism in two cases (2.32%), and positive serology for hepatitis B virus in 4 cases (4.65%) and for hepatitis C virus in 5 cases (5.81%). LIMITATIONS: Serial sections were not performed in all cases. At least 10 sections were studied in each case. When vasculitis was evident in some of these first 10 sections, no further sections were cut, but when histopathologic features of vasculitis were not found in the first 10 sections, serial sections throughout the specimen were performed looking for vasculitis. Because some type of vasculitis was evident in the first 10 sections of 91 cases, serial sections were performed only in the remaining 10 cases and they failed to demonstrate clear-cut histopathologic features of vasculitis. On the other hand, this is a retrospective study that was performed from the histopathologic slides of our files, and only the clinical information contained in the report accompanying the biopsy specimen could be recorded. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, vasculitis is present in most lesions of erythema induratum of Bazin, and the nature, location, and size of the involved vessels is, from more to less frequent, as follows: (1) small venules of the fat lobule; (2) both veins of the connective tissue septa and venules of the fat lobule; (3) only veins of the connective tissue septa; (4) veins and arteries of the connective tissue septa and venules of the fat lobule; and (5) veins and arteries of the connective tissue septa. However, in some cases with all clinicopathologic features of erythema induratum of Bazin vasculitis could not be demonstrated with serial sections throughout the specimen and, therefore, the presence of vasculitis should be not considered as a criterion sine qua non for histopathologic diagnosis of erythema induratum of Bazin.","['Segura, Sonia', 'Pujol, Ramon M', 'Trindade, Felicidade', 'Requena, Luis']","['Segura S', 'Pujol RM', 'Trindade F', 'Requena L']","['Department of Dermatology at Hospital del Mar, Universitat Autonoma, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Erythema Induratum/complications/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leg/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Panniculitis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/blood supply/*pathology', 'Vasculitis/complications/*pathology']",2009/01/03 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2009/01/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]']","['S0190-9622(08)00920-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2008.07.030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008 Nov;59(5):839-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2008.07.030.,10.1016/j.jaad.2008.07.030 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon exposure to BPB-PLA(2), elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels and p38 MAPK activation were observed in U937 cells. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM (Ca(2+) chelator) and nifedipine (L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker) abrogated Ca(2+) increase and p38 MAPK activation, and rescued viability of BPB-PLA(2)-treated U937 cells. BPB-PLA(2)-induced dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and down-regulation of Bcl-2 were suppressed by SB202190 (p38MAPK inhibitor). Although PLA(2) mutants in which His-48 and Asp-49 were substituted by Ala and Lys, respectively, did not display detectable PLA(2) activity, they induced death of U937 cells. The signaling pathway of PLA(2) mutants in inducing cell death was indistinguishable from that of BPB-PLA(2). Taken together, our data indicate that catalytic activity-independent pathway is involved in PLA(2)-induced apoptotic death of human leukemia U937 cells via mitochondria-mediated death pathway triggering by Ca(2+)-mediated p38 MAPK activation.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Kao, Pei-Hsiu', 'Chiou, Yi-Ling', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren', 'Wu, Ming-Jung', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Liu WH', 'Kao PH', 'Chiou YL', 'Lin SR', 'Wu MJ', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University-Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'PN0FRW1G4Z (4-bromophenacyl bromide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Elapid Venoms/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Phospholipases A2/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/01/03 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/01/03 09:00'],"['2008/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(08)01371-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2009 Mar 10;185(2):102-9. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.12.004.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of HL-60 cells promotes granulocytic differentiation and is effective as differentiation therapy for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The identification of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by ATRA has provided insight into granulocytic differentiation and differentiation therapy. The Asb-2 (ankyrin repeat SOCS box 2) gene has previously been identified as a transcriptional target in ATRA-treated HL-60 cells. The ASB-2 protein forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with the proteins, Cul5, regulator of cullin 2 (ROC2), and elongin B and C. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is increased expression of Cul5 during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. To induce granulocytic differentiation, HL-60 cells were treated for 5 d with ATRA and differentiation was confirmed by examining superoxide anion production, nuclear morphology, and changes in the expression of CD11b, CD13, and CD15. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to measure Cul5 mRNA expression and also the expression of other components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase (ASB-2, ROC2, elongin B and C). Granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells was associated with a 1.6-, 1.7-, and 23-fold statistically significant (P <or= 0.05) increase in mRNA expression for Cul5, ROC2, and ASB-2, respectively. No significant change was found in elongin B and C mRNA expression. Using Western blot analysis, the expression of Cul5 protein was increased 6.5-fold with granulocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells. Increased expression of multiple components of the Cul5-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with ATRA treatment of HL-60 cells indicates that this complex may play an important role in granulocytic differentiation.","['Baxter, Shaneen S', 'Carlson, Lauren A', 'Mayer, Alejandro M S', 'Hall, Mary L', 'Fay, Michael J']","['Baxter SS', 'Carlson LA', 'Mayer AM', 'Hall ML', 'Fay MJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine, Midwestern University, 555 31st Street, Downers Grove, IL 60515, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

In many patients, the genetic causes of severe congenital neutropenia are unknown. METHODS: We performed genomewide genotyping and linkage analysis on two consanguineous pedigrees with a total of five children affected with severe congenital neutropenia. Candidate genes from the linkage interval were sequenced. Functional assays and reconstitution experiments were carried out. RESULTS: All index patients were susceptible to bacterial infections and had very few mature neutrophils in the bone marrow; structural heart defects, urogenital abnormalities, and venous angiectasia on the trunk and extremities were additional features. Linkage analysis of the two index families yielded a combined multipoint lod score of 5.74 on a linkage interval on chromosome 17q21. Sequencing of G6PC3, the candidate gene encoding glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit 3, revealed a homozygous missense mutation in exon 6 that abolished the enzymatic activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in all affected children in the two families. The patients' neutrophils and fibroblasts had increased susceptibility to apoptosis. The myeloid cells showed evidence of increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). We identified seven additional, unrelated patients who had severe congenital neutropenia with syndromic features and distinct biallelic mutations in G6PC3. CONCLUSIONS: Defective function of glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit 3, underlies a severe congenital neutropenia syndrome associated with cardiac and urogenital malformations.","['Boztug, Kaan', 'Appaswamy, Giridharan', 'Ashikov, Angel', 'Schaffer, Alejandro A', 'Salzer, Ulrich', 'Diestelhorst, Jana', 'Germeshausen, Manuela', 'Brandes, Gudrun', 'Lee-Gossler, Jacqueline', 'Noyan, Fatih', 'Gatzke, Anna-Katherina', 'Minkov, Milen', 'Greil, Johann', 'Kratz, Christian', 'Petropoulou, Theoni', 'Pellier, Isabelle', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine', 'Rezaei, Nima', 'Monkemoller, Kirsten', 'Irani-Hakimeh, Noha', 'Bakker, Hans', 'Gerardy-Schahn, Rita', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Grimbacher, Bodo', 'Welte, Karl', 'Klein, Christoph']","['Boztug K', 'Appaswamy G', 'Ashikov A', 'Schaffer AA', 'Salzer U', 'Diestelhorst J', 'Germeshausen M', 'Brandes G', 'Lee-Gossler J', 'Noyan F', 'Gatzke AK', 'Minkov M', 'Greil J', 'Kratz C', 'Petropoulou T', 'Pellier I', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C', 'Rezaei N', 'Monkemoller K', 'Irani-Hakimeh N', 'Bakker H', 'Gerardy-Schahn R', 'Zeidler C', 'Grimbacher B', 'Welte K', 'Klein C']","['Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['EC 3.1.3.9 (Glucose-6-Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Glucose-6-Phosphatase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glycogen Storage Disease Type I/genetics', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lod Score', 'Male', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Pedigree', 'Syndrome', 'Telangiectasis/genetics', 'Urogenital Abnormalities/*genetics']",2009/01/02 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2009/01/02 09:00'],"['2009/01/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]']","['360/1/32 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0805051 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2009 Jan 1;360(1):32-43. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0805051.,10.1056/NEJMoa0805051 [doi],,"['Z01 LM000097-06/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 LM999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2778311,['N Engl J Med. 2009 Jan 1;360(1):3-5.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CD52 is a surface glycoprotein highly expressed on eosinophils. We treated 11 patients with advanced HES/CEL with alemtuzumab, a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody. Alemtuzumab was administered, in general, first in escalating doses (5, 10, 30 mg i.v. on days 1-3), then at the tolerated dose thrice per week for a total of 12 doses. Patients with complete hematologic response (CHR; normal percent and absolute eosinophil count) were allowed to continue therapy once weekly as maintenance. RESULTS: Ten patients (91%) achieved CHR after a median of 2 weeks (0.5-5 weeks) of therapy. Bone marrow eosinophilia resolved in four of seven evaluable patients. The median duration of CHR was 3 months (1.5-17+ months). Seven of the 10 CHR patients relapsed, five while off-therapy. Two patients achieved second CHR upon alemtuzumab rechallenge. Three patients experienced mild infusion-related symptoms, two developed cytomegalovirus reactivation requiring therapy, and one developed orbital lymphoma that was successfully treated. CONCLUSIONS: Our limited experience suggests alemtuzumab to be a valuable therapy for advanced HES or CEL, refractory to standard therapies, and supports the clinical evaluation of alemtuzumab in a larger trial.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Luthra, Raja', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Ault, Pat', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Verstovsek S', 'Tefferi A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Manshouri T', 'Luthra R', 'Pardanani A', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Ravandi F', 'Ault P', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Obatoclax is a small-molecule antagonist of the BH3-binding groove of Bcl-2 proteins that may enhance tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) sensitivity and efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human pancreatic cancer cell lines were incubated with obatoclax and/or TRAIL and cell viability, Annexin V labeling, caspase cleavage, and cytochrome c release were measured. In drug-treated cell lines, protein-protein interactions were studied by immunoprecipitation. Bax/Bak activation was analyzed using conformation-specific antibodies. Lentiviral short hairpin RNA was used to knockdown Bim, Bid, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) expression. RESULTS: Obatoclax reduced the viability of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines and synergistically enhanced TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Obatoclax enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, as shown by Annexin V labeling, which was accompanied by caspase activation (caspase-8, -9, and -3) and cleavage of Bid. Obatoclax potentiated TRAIL-mediated Bax/Bak activation and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, Smac, and AIF. Mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of obatoclax include displacement of Bak from its sequestration by Bcl-x(L) or Mcl-1 and release of Bim from Bcl-2 or Mcl-1. Bid knockdown by short hairpin RNA attenuated caspase cleavage and cytotoxicity of obatoclax plus TRAIL. Bim knockdown failed to inhibit the cytotoxic effect of obatoclax alone or combined with TRAIL yet attenuated TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Jurkat cells were treated with various concentrations of GSE for 12 and 24 h or with 50 microg/mL GSE for various time intervals, after which apoptosis, caspase activation, and cell signaling pathways were evaluated. Parallel studies were done in U937 and HL-60 human leukemia cells. RESULTS: Exposure of Jurkat cells to GSE resulted in dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis and caspase activation, events associated with the pronounced increase in Cip1/p21 protein level. Furthermore, treatment of Jurkat cells with GSE resulted in marked increase in levels of phospho-JNK. Conversely, interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic inhibitor (e.g., SP600125) or genetic (e.g., small interfering RNA) approaches displayed significant protection against GSE-mediated lethality in Jurkat cells. CONCLUSIONS: The result of the present study showed that GSE induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells through a process that involves sustained JNK activation and Cip1/p21 up-regulation, culminating in caspase activation.","['Gao, Ning', 'Budhraja, Amit', 'Cheng, Senping', 'Yao, Hua', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Shi, Xianglin']","['Gao N', 'Budhraja A', 'Cheng S', 'Yao H', 'Zhang Z', 'Shi X']","[""Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, 3rd Military Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Grape Seed Extract)', '0 (Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proanthocyanidins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Grape Seed Extract', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/01/02 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/01/02 09:00'],"['2009/01/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['15/1/140 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1447 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jan 1;15(1):140-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1447.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1447 [doi],,"['R01 ES015375/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES015375-03/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2760842,,,,,['NIHMS133143'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify subgroups with distinct genetic, histopathologic, and prognostic features. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for high-resolution analysis of 51 PTCL-U patients and the array data for examining possible correlations of histopathologic and clinical features. Moreover, we compared the genetic, histopathologic, and prognostic features of the PTCL-U cases with those of 59 cases of lymphoma-type adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). RESULTS: We identified 32 regions with frequent genomic imbalance, 1 region with high copy number gain at 14q32.2, and 1 region with homozygous loss at 9p21.3. Gains of 7p and 7q and loss of 9p21.3 showed a significant association with poor prognosis. PTCL-U cases with genomic imbalance showed distinct histopathologic and prognostic features compared with such cases without alteration and a marked genetic, histopathologic, and prognostic resemblance to lymphoma-type ATLL. CONCLUSIONS: The array CGH enabled us to identify the frequently altered genomic regions with strong prognostic power among PTCL-U cases. A correlative analysis using the array CGH data disclosed a subgroup in PTCL-U with genomic alterations and with histopathologic and clinical relevance. In addition to histopathologic similarity, the strong genetic and prognostic resemblance between PTCL-U cases with genomic imbalance detected by array CGH and lymphoma-type ATLL seems to support the notion that the former may constitute a distinct PTCL-U subgroup.","['Nakagawa, Masao', 'Nakagawa-Oshiro, Aya', 'Karnan, Sivasundaram', 'Tagawa, Hiroyuki', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Takeuchi, Ichiro', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Seto, Masao']","['Nakagawa M', 'Nakagawa-Oshiro A', 'Karnan S', 'Tagawa H', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Nakamura S', 'Takeuchi I', 'Ohshima K', 'Seto M']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis']",2009/01/02 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/01/02 09:00'],"['2009/01/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['15/1/30 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1808 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jan 1;15(1):30-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1808.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1808 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore conducted pretargeted (P)RIT studies to augment the efficacy in mice of therapy using a pretargeted anti-human (h)CD45 antibody (Ab)-streptavidin (SA) conjugate followed by a biotinylated clearing agent and radiolabeled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacylodode cane N,N',N"",N'''-tetraacetic (DOTA)-biotin.

These effects are responsible for the chemotherapeutic activities of members of the taxane and Vinca alkaloid families in oncology. Unfortunately, a major side effect of the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids is the development of peripheral neuropathies. Indibulin (N-[pyridin-4-yl]-[1-(4-chlorbenzyl)-indol-3-yl]-glyoxyl-amid; D-24851; ZIO-301), a novel synthetic small molecule microtubule inhibitor, destabilizes microtubules and has antitumor activity but does not exhibit neurotoxicity in preclinical animal studies. In the present study, it has been found that indibulin is able to discriminate between highly posttranslationally modified tubulin present in mature neuronal microtubules, and less-modified tubulin present in immature neuronal or nonneuronal microtubules. Vincristine and colchicine act on either tubulin equally well. The binding site of indibulin on mature neuronal microtubules seems to be inaccessible due to the posttranslational modifications, a theory that is supported by the observation that indibulin did not disrupt the integrity of highly modified microtubules present in neurites of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The specificity of indibulin for unmodified microtubules seems to be dependent on the pyridyl moiety of indibulin because derivatives that have the pyridyl moiety replaced are not able to discriminate between highly and less-modified tubulins. The observed broad antitumor activity of indibulin and the lack of central and peripheral nervous system toxicity in preclinical studies make it a promising candidate for development as a cancer treatment.

We find that clinically achievable levels of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, can modify chromatin and restore the ability of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to induce monocytic differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cells NB4 and U937. Although 5-AZA-dC cannot fully induce differentiation, we show that 5-AZA-dC acts directly on TNFalpha-responsive promoters to facilitate TNFalpha-induced transcriptional pathways leading to differentiation. 5-AZA-dC regulates the expression of Dif-2, a TNFalpha target gene, by deacetylating chromatin domains in a methylation-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the Dif-2 promoter show histone hyperacetylation and a recruitment of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor in response to 5-AZA-dC. Furthermore, 5-AZA-dC plus TNFalpha enhances the level of phosphorylated RNA Pol II at the Dif-2 promoter via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We conclude that nonspecific changes in chromatin can allow a specific transcriptional inducer to overcome blocks in leukemic cell differentiation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For this study, 17 patients (6 medulloblastoma, 5 ALL treated with high-dose methotrexate (MTX) (4 x 5 g/m(2)) and 6 with low-dose MTX (3 x 2 g/m(2))) and 17 age-matched controls participated. On a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed, and WMFA values were calculated, including specific regions of interest (ROIs), and correlated with the speed of processing and motor speed. RESULTS: Mean WMFA in the patient group, mean age 14 years (range 8.9 - 16.9), was decreased compared with the control group (p = 0.01), as well as WMFA in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciliculus (IFO) (p = 0.03) and in the genu of the corpus callosum (gCC) (p = 0.01). Based on neurocognitive results, significant positive correlations were present between processing speed and WMFA in the splenium (sCC) (r = 0.53, p = 0.03) and the body of the corpus callosum (bCC) (r = 0.52, p = 0.03), whereas the right IFO WMFA was related to motor speed (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: White matter tracts, using a 3.0-T MRI scanner, show impairment in childhood cancer survivors, medulloblastoma survivors, and also those treated with high doses of MTX. In particular, white matter tracts in the sCC, bCC and right IFO are positively correlated with speed of processing and motor speed.","['Aukema, Eline J', 'Caan, Matthan W A', 'Oudhuis, Nienke', 'Majoie, Charles B L M', 'Vos, Frans M', 'Reneman, Liesbeth', 'Last, Bob F', 'Grootenhuis, Martha A', 'Schouten-van Meeteren, Antoinette Y N']","['Aukema EJ', 'Caan MW', 'Oudhuis N', 'Majoie CB', 'Vos FM', 'Reneman L', 'Last BF', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'Schouten-van Meeteren AY']","[""Pediatric Psychosocial Department, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. e.j.aukema@amc.uva.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anisotropy', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Corpus Callosum/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Humans', 'Intelligence/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Internal Capsule/drug effects/physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Medulloblastoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Mental Processes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Motor Activity/drug effects/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivors']",2009/01/02 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(08)03502-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.08.060 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jul 1;74(3):837-43. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.08.060.

The early complications of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft failure and delayed engraftment, as well as disease recurrence have limited the use of this approach. Newer strategies have been applied and overcome some of the problems, including the use of T-cell depleted graft, ""mega"" dose of stem cells, intensive post-transplant immunosuppression and manipulation of the graft. These have decreased the transplant related mortality and GVHD associated with haploidentical transplantation, however, the major problems of disease relapse and infection, which related to late immune reconstitution, limit the development of haploidentical HSCT. Future challenges remain in improving post-transplant immune reconstitution and finding the best approach to reduce the incidence and severity of GVHD, while preserving graft-versus-leukemia effect to prevent the recurrence of underlying malignancy.","['Huang, Xiao-jun']",['Huang XJ'],"[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, No 11, Xi Zhi Men South Street, Beijing, 10044, PR China. xjhrm@medmail.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*trends', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/01/02 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2009/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-1-27 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-27 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Dec 31;1:27. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-27.,10.1186/1756-8722-1-27 [doi],20081231,,PMC2637880,,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the authors analyzed for risk factors that affect transplantation outcome, and they focused particularly on the prognostic relevance of minimal residual disease level at each treatment stage. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL who completed allogeneic stem cell transplantation following imatinib therapy were enrolled in this study. For minimal residual disease monitoring, 548 marrow samples were analyzed by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: After the first 4-week imatinib therapy, 11 patients (21.2%) achieved molecular remission, and the remaining 41 patients had a reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels (median, 3.21 log) from baseline value. The frequency of achieving a reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels of at least 3 log at this stage was 36 (69.2%). Forty-eight (92.3%) of the 52 patients received stem cell transplantation during first complete remission. With a median follow-up of 49 months after stem cell transplantation, the 4-year relapse rate and disease-free survival rate were 21.2% and 69.8%, respectively. A reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels of at least 3 log after the first 4-week imatinib therapy was identified as the most powerful predictor of lower relapse (12.1% vs 45.1%, P = .011) and better disease-free survival (82.1% vs 41.7%, P = .009) rates. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective assessment of the extent of minimal residual disease reduction after the first 4-week imatinib therapy may allow the authors to identify subgroups of Ph-positive ALL transplants at high risk of relapse.","['Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Chung, Nak-Gyun', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Chun-Choo']","['Lee S', 'Kim YJ', 'Chung NG', 'Lim J', 'Lee DG', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Kim CC']","['Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. leeseok@catholic.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors']",2009/01/02 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/01/02 09:00'],"['2009/01/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24026 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Feb 1;115(3):561-70. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24026.,10.1002/cncr.24026 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment guidelines propose dose escalation based on clinical assessments of disease response. METHODS: Response and survival were analyzed in a cohort of patients (n = 106) with newly diagnosed CML-CP who were enrolled on the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) trial, who began treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily, and who subsequently underwent dose escalation to either 600 mg or 800 mg daily. Reasons for dose escalation were evaluated retrospectively based on 2 sets of criteria: the IRIS protocol-defined criteria (n = 39 patients) and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations (n = 48 patients). RESULTS: Among all 106 patients who underwent dose escalation, the rates of freedom from progression to accelerated phase or blast phase and overall survival were 89% and 84% at 3 years after dose increase, respectively. A cytogenetic response was obtained in 42% of patients who had their dose escalated based on protocol criteria and in 38% of patients who had their dose escalated according to the ELN recommendations.

Bendamustine is a unique alkylating agent that has distinctive preclinical activity in cell lines resistant to other alkylators. Furthermore, clinical activity has been demonstrated in patients with alkylating agent resistant disease. Recently, larger studies have been organized to study the clinical effects of bendamustine further. In indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is resistant to rituximab, bendamustine induced a remission in 77% of patients. Myelosuppression was identified as the most common toxicity. In 2 studies of similar populations of patients, the combination of bendamustine and rituximab induced remission 90% of patients with a median progression-free survival of 23-24 months.

METHODS: We searched the electronic CLL database for consecutive patients who presented to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Department of Leukemia from October 2003 to April 2007 with untreated CLL and who had an 11q22 deletion, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow samples. FISH analysis was performed using the following probes: trisomy 12 (12p11.1-q11), TP53 (17p13.1), ATM (11q22.3), LAMP1 (13q34), and D13S319 loci (13q14.3). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients with untreated CLL with an 11q22 deletion were identified. The median patient age was 59 years (range, 26-81 years); 80% were men, 53% had Zubrod performance status>0, and 13% had Rai stage III to IV disease. Lymphadenopathy (massive), splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were present in 96% (12%), 19%, 9%, and 4%, respectively. In addition, 62% of patients had deletions in 13q, and 3% had trisomy 12. Forty patients required therapy for progressive disease. The overall response rates for FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab), CFAR (FCR plus alemtuzumab), and rituximab plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were 100%, 100%, and 33%, respectively. The 11q22 deletion was undetectable in 25 of 27 patients monitored after treatment using FISH analysis. The median follow-up was 17 months. At 1 and 3 years, the survival rates were 97% and 91%, respectively, and the relapse-free survival rates were 100% and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CLL with an 11q22 deletion was associated with high rates of response, survival, and relapse-free survival when treated with chemoimmunotherapy.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wierda, William G', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Tam C', 'Abruzzo LV', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wierda WG', 'Lerner S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Analysis of DNA strand breaks by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling showed that carnosol delayed DNA cleavage in the cells when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. Co-treatment of the cells with carnosol and chemotherapeutic drugs did not reduce mitochondrial membrane depolarization compared to the drug treatment alone. Time course analysis of caspase-3 activation by flow cytometry showed co-treatment with carnosol and drugs increased the activation of caspase-3 above that observed for the chemotherapeutic drugs alone. A lower percentage of caspase-3 positive cells progressed to an apoptotic phenotype when co-treated with carnosol and the chemotherapeutic drugs compared to drugs alone.

Although many of the endogenous retroviruses are defective, several contain one or more intact viral genes that are expressed under certain physiological or pathological conditions. This is true of the endogenous polytropic retroviruses that generate recombinant polytropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs). In these recombinants the env gene sequences of exogenous ecotropic MuLVs are replaced with env gene sequences from an endogenous polytropic retrovirus. Although replication-competent endogenous polytropic retroviruses have not been observed, the recombinant polytropic viruses are capable of replicating in numerous species. Recombination occurs during reverse transcription of a virion RNA heterodimer comprised of an RNA transcript from an endogenous polytropic virus and an RNA transcript from an exogenous ecotropic MuLV RNA. It is possible that homodimers corresponding to two full-length endogenous RNA genomes are also packaged. Thus, infection by an exogenous virus may result not only in recombination with endogenous sequences, but also in the mobilization of complete endogenous retrovirus genomes via pseudotyping within exogenous retroviral virions. We report that the infection of mice with an ecotropic virus results in pseudotyping of intact endogenous viruses that have not undergone recombination. The endogenous retroviruses infect and are integrated into target cell genomes and subsequently replicate and spread as pseudotyped viruses. The mobilization of endogenous retroviruses upon infection with an exogenous retrovirus may represent a major interaction of exogenous retroviruses with endogenous retroviruses and may have profound effects on the pathogenicity of retroviral infections.","['Evans, Leonard H', 'Alamgir, A S M', 'Owens, Nick', 'Weber, Nick', 'Virtaneva, Kimmo', 'Barbian, Kent', 'Babar, Amenah', 'Malik, Frank', 'Rosenke, Kyle']","['Evans LH', 'Alamgir AS', 'Owens N', 'Weber N', 'Virtaneva K', 'Barbian K', 'Babar A', 'Malik F', 'Rosenke K']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA. levans@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*growth & development/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Virus Assembly']",2009/01/01 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2009/01/01 09:00'],"['2009/01/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01926-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01926-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Mar;83(6):2429-35. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01926-08.

Besides its well-known role in nociception, which is mediated by vanilloid receptor 1 specifically expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, capsaicin has also been considered as a potential anticancer agent, as it inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. Here we identified a new molecular target of capsaicin from human myeloid leukemia cells. We show that capsaicin binds to prohibitin (PHB) 2, which is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and induces its translocation to the nucleus. PHB2 is implicated in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and the control of apoptosis. We also provide evidence suggesting that capsaicin causes apoptosis directly through the mitochondria and that PHB2 contributes to capsaicin-induced apoptosis at multiple levels. This work will serve as an important foundation for further understanding of anticancer activity of capsaicin.","['Kuramori, Chikanori', 'Azuma, Motoki', 'Kume, Kanako', 'Kaneko, Yuki', 'Inoue, Atsushi', 'Yamaguchi, Yuki', 'Kabe, Yasuaki', 'Hosoya, Takamitsu', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Suematsu, Makoto', 'Handa, Hiroshi']","['Kuramori C', 'Azuma M', 'Kume K', 'Kaneko Y', 'Inoue A', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Kabe Y', 'Hosoya T', 'Kizaki M', 'Suematsu M', 'Handa H']","['Graduate School of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotide Translocator 2)', '0 (Analgesics)', '0 (PHB protein, human)', '0 (PHB2 protein, human)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adenine Nucleotide Translocator 2/metabolism', 'Analgesics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Capsaicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Prohibitins', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/01/01 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2009/01/01 09:00'],"['2008/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(08)02510-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Feb 6;379(2):519-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.103.

METHODS: K562 cells were transfected with recombined adenovirus-PTEN vector containing green fluorescent protein (Ad-PTEN-GFP), followed by the treatment of the cells with or without rapamycin. The proliferation inhibition rate and apoptotic rate of these transfected and/or rapamycin treated K562 cells were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry (FCM), the expression levels of PTEN-, mTOR-, cyclinD1- and P27kip1- mRNA were measured by real-time fluorescent relative-quantification reverse transcriptional PCR (FQ-PCR), the protein expression levels of PTEN, Akt, p-Akt were detected by western blotting. RESULTS: The proliferation of K562 cells was inhibited by PTEN gene transfection with/without the treatment of rapamycin. The expression levels of PTEN- and P27kip1- mRNA were up-regulated, and the mTOR- and cyclinD1- mRNA were down-regulated in K562 cells after the cells transfected with wild type PTEN gene and treated with rapamycin. CONCLUSION: PTEN and rapamycin inhibited mTOR expression by acting as an upstream regulator of mTOR. Low dose rapamycin in combination with over-expressed PTEN might have synergistic effects on inhibiting the proliferation and promoting apoptosis of K562 cells.","['Cheng, Zhi Y', 'Guo, Xiao L', 'Yang, Xiao Y', 'Niu, Zhi Y', 'Li, Shi H', 'Wang, Su Y', 'Chen, Hao', 'Pan, Ling']","['Cheng ZY', 'Guo XL', 'Yang XY', 'Niu ZY', 'Li SH', 'Wang SY', 'Chen H', 'Pan L']","['Department of Hematology and Heibei Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, PR China. dzczy@sohu.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transfection']",2009/01/01 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/01/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-27-87 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-27-87 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Dec 30;27:87. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-27-87.,10.1186/1756-9966-27-87 [doi],20081230,,PMC2639541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA vectors expressing viral antigens are very safe vaccines, but so far they have not been efficient enough to induced broad protective immunity against retroviruses. One strategy to enhance the efficiency of DNA vaccines is to augment effector T-cell priming against viral components by manipulating regulatory T-cell functions (Treg). Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) is a molecule that is constitutively expressed on CD4(+) Treg cells, and antibodies or natural ligands binding this molecule can impair Treg cell suppression. Here we demonstrate using the retroviral Friend virus (FV) mouse model, that co-immunization of FV antigens along with GITR-ligand (GITRL) encoding plasmids protected mice efficiently against a FV challenge. On the other hand, treatment of DNA-vaccinated mice with alpha-GITR antibody did not improve vaccine-induced protection at all. Thus, for an effective priming of immunity against FV, GITRL and viral antigens might have to be expressed within the same local environment. The data suggest that limitations in DNA vaccination can be overcome by co-expressing co-stimulatory molecules that potentially manipulate the function of Treg cells during priming of anti-retroviral immunity.","['Dittmer, Ulf', 'Werner, Tanja', 'Kraft, Anke R M']","['Dittmer U', 'Werner T', 'Kraft AR']","['Institut fur Virologie des Universitatsklinikums Essen, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tnfrsf18 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf18 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein', 'Humans', '*Immunization', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Plasmids/administration & dosage/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology']",2009/01/01 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2009/01/01 09:00'],"['2009/01/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/vim.2008.0046 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2008 Dec;21(4):459-67. doi: 10.1089/vim.2008.0046.,10.1089/vim.2008.0046 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hoxa1 gene (Hox1.6, ERA1) encodes two alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode distinct proteins, one with the homeodomain (Hoxa1-993), and another protein lacking this domain (Hoxa1-399). The functions of Hoxa1-399 are unknown. We detected Hoxa1-993 and Hoxa1-399 by immunoprecipitation using Hoxa1 antibodies. To assess whether Hoxa1-399 functions in cellular differentiation, we analyzed Hoxb1, a Hoxa1 target gene. Hoxa1-993 and its cofactor, Pbx1, bind to the Hoxb1 SOct-R3 promoter to transcriptionally activate a luciferase reporter. Results from F9 stem cells that stably express ectopic Hoxa1-399 (the F9-399 line) show that Hoxa1-399 reduces this transcriptional activation. Gel shift assays demonstrate that Hoxa1-399 reduces Hoxa1-993/Pbx1 binding to the Hoxb1 SOct-R3 region. GST pull-down experiments suggest that Hoxa1-399, Hoxa1-993, and Pbx1 form a trimer.

Stem cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew and to generate differentiated cells of a particular tissue, and are classified into embryonic and somatic stem cells. Embryonic stem (ES) cells self-renew indefinitely and contribute to derivatives of all three primary germ layers. In contrast, somatic stem cells, which can be identified in various adult organs, exhibit limited abilities for self-renewal and differentiation in most cases. The multi-lineage differentiation capacity of ES cells and somatic stem cells has opened possibilities for cell replacement therapies for genetic, malignant and degenerative diseases. In order to utilize stem cells for therapeutic applications, it is essential to understand the extrinsic and intrinsic factors regulating self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. More recently, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated from mouse and human fibroblasts that resemble ES cells via ectopic expression of four transcription factors. iPS cells may have an advantage in regenerative medicine, since they overcome the immunogenicity and ethical controversy of ES cells. Moreover, recent studies have highlighted the involvement of cancer stem cells during the formation and progression of various types of cancers, including leukemia, glioma, and breast cancer. Here, we illustrate the roles of TGF-beta family members in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells, somatic stem cells, and cancer stem cells.","['Watabe, Tetsuro', 'Miyazono, Kohei']","['Watabe T', 'Miyazono K']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. t-watabe@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Endoderm/physiology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/physiology', 'Mesoderm/physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiology']",2008/12/31 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2008/12/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]']","['cr2008323 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2008.323 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):103-15. doi: 10.1038/cr.2008.323.,10.1038/cr.2008.323 [doi],,,,,,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The entity of ifosfamide neurotoxicity can be of different degree, from very light and transient to fatal. CASE REPORTS: All cases of ifosfamide neurotoxicity recorded at the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit in the 15-year period between 1989 and 2003 are reported. Five cases of neurotoxicity occurring during or immediately after ifosfamide infusion were recorded in children with both solid tumors or leukemia. The drug was administered in different chemotherapeutic associations and dosages. Concomitant clinical conditions possibly playing a role as risk factors were the administration of other neurotoxic drugs, the presence of cerebral metastasis, a subclinical lysis syndrome, and altered respiratory function. Symptoms were transient in all cases and consisted in all but one of partial or generalized seizures. In four cases the treatment was continued, substituting ifosfamide with cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSIONS: Particularly in patients presenting risk factors, we advise paying attention to the risk of ifosfamide neurotoxicity and rapidly suspending the drug administration to avoid irreparable damage to the central nervous system. Thereafter the treatment can be reassessed. If ifosfamide is considered the best option for the given case, it could be safely readministered in association with methylene blue or thiamine. If encephalopathy reappears, substitution of ifosfamide with cyclophosphamide could offer the same opportunities of cure to the patient.","['Di Cataldo, Andrea', 'Astuto, Marinella', 'Rizzo, Giuliana', 'Bertuna, Gregoria', 'Russo, Giovanna', 'Incorpora, Gemma']","['Di Cataldo A', 'Astuto M', 'Rizzo G', 'Bertuna G', 'Russo G', 'Incorpora G']","['Unit of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Policlinico, University of Catania, Catania, Italy. adicata@unict.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology/*pathology']",2008/12/31 09:00,2009/03/17 09:00,['2008/12/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [medline]']",['869528 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2009 Jan;15(1):CS22-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory peptide targets a triple-stranded coiled-coil motif of the fusion-active transmembrane glycoprotein and in a trans-dominant negative manner blocks resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins form. The LHR-mimetic is, therefore, functionally analogous to the C34/T20-type inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus. Previous attempts to shorten the bioactive peptide produced peptides with severely attenuated activity. We now demonstrate that truncated peptides often suffer from poor solubility and impaired coiled coil binding properties, and we identify features that are critical to peptide function. In particular, the alpha-helical region of the LHR-mimetic is necessary but not sufficient for inhibitory activity. Moreover, two basic residues are crucial for coiled-coil binding and efficient inhibition of membrane fusion. By retaining these basic residues and a region of main chain peptide contacts with the coiled coil, a core LHR-mimetic was obtained that retains both the inhibitory properties and solubility profile of the parental peptide. Variants of the core peptide inhibit both membrane fusion and infection of cells by free viral particles, but unexpectedly, infection by virions was more susceptible to inhibition by low activity inhibitors than syncytium formation. The core inhibitor provides a valuable lead in the search for smaller more bio-available peptides and peptido-mimetics that possess anti-viral activity. Such molecules may be attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention in human T cell leukemia virus type 1 infections.","['Lamb, Daniel', 'Mirsaliotis, Antonis', 'Kelly, Sharon M', 'Brighty, David W']","['Lamb D', 'Mirsaliotis A', 'Kelly SM', 'Brighty DW']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biomimetic Materials/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Peptides/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Internalization/*drug effects']",2008/12/31 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2008/12/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32685-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M806725200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 6;284(10):6575-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M806725200.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, outcomes, and factors associated with other cancers in patients with CLL/SLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of consecutive patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL seen at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1985 to 2005. The number of second cancers observed was compared with the number expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Among 2,028 patients, 324 (16%) had a history of other cancers and 227 (11.2%) developed other malignancies during the follow-up period. Overall, 625 cancers were observed in 551 patients, including skin (30%), prostate (13%), breast (9%), melanoma (8%), lymphoma (8%), gastrointestinal (9%), lung (6%), and other cancers (17%). The risk of a second cancer was 2.2 times higher than the expected risk. The response rates in patients with and without a history of other cancers were 86% and 92%, respectively (P = .04), and the 5-year survival rates were 70% and 82%, respectively (P < .001). In Cox analysis, independent factors predicting development of new cancers were older age, male sex, and elevated levels of beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine. In patients who were treated for CLL/SLL, the treatment regimen did not affect the risk of subsequent cancer (P = .49). CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL/SLL have more than twice the risk of developing a second cancer and an increased frequency of certain cancer types. Awareness of risk factors could permit early detection.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Wen, Sijin', 'McLaughlin, Peter', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wierda, William G', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Strom, Sara', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Wen S', 'McLaughlin P', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wierda WG', 'Lerner S', 'Strom S', 'Freireich EJ', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: PI-PLCbeta1, PI-PLCbeta4, and PI-PLCgamma1 cytogenetic investigations were performed on 80 newly diagnosed MDS patients (18 low risk, 26 intermediate 1, 18 intermediate 2, 18 high risk) comparing the results with the clinical outcome of the patients. Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridization results were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Finally, PI-PLCbeta1 gene and protein expression were assessed by both real-time PCR and immunocytochemical experiments. RESULTS: Collectively, 35 (43.75%) of 80 of the MDS patients showed a specific mono-allelic deletion of PI-PLCbeta1. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant association (P < .0001) between the PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion and a higher risk of evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), since 23 of 35 MDS patients (65.7%) bearing the PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion evolved into AML. Even in multivariate analysis, the PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion retained a higher significance, with a P < .001, as a prognostic factor of evolution into AML (odds ratio [OR] 1.83; 95% CI, 2.26 to 17.24; P = .00045). Finally, PI-PLCbeta1 deletion was related to an altered gene and protein expression. CONCLUSION: PI-PLCbeta1 mono-allelic deletion is associated with a worse clinical outcome in MDS patients, hinting at the identification of a new group at higher risk of AML evolution and representing a reliable prognostic tool. Moreover, targeting PI-PLCbeta1 pathways might emerge as a new therapeutic strategy for MDS.","['Follo, Matilde Y', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Clissa, Cristina', 'Mongiorgi, Sara', 'Bosi, Costanza', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Follo MY', 'Finelli C', 'Clissa C', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Bosi C', 'Martinelli G', 'Baccarani M', 'Manzoli L', 'Martelli AM', 'Cocco L']","['Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, Cellular Signalling Laboratory, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. lucio.cocco@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*genetics/mortality', 'Phospholipase C beta/*genetics', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/12/31 09:00,2009/02/27 09:00,['2008/12/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.3748 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.3748 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 10;27(5):782-90. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.3748.

METHODS: Ten leukemic patients who developed severe steroid-resistant aGVHD during UD-HSCT received a standard dose of anti-CD25 mAb and a medium or low dose of ATG. The effect on aGVHD control, patients' survival, infection and relapse after the therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight of the 10 patients had complete remission and 2 had partial remission after the combined therapy. In the 8 patients with complete remission, 2 developed third degree aGVHD 3-3.5 months after the transplantation, and were managed with a second combined therapy to successfully achieve complete remission. In the total of 12 combined treatments, the median time of therapeutic effect was 5 days (3-10 days); the median complete relief time was 12 days (8-30 days) in the 10 cases. Among the 8 patients who survived for more than 3 months, 7 were diagnosed to have chronic GVHD including 4 with extensive chronic GVHD. No relapse of leukemia was found in these patients. Five patients survived the 2-year-long follow-up after the transplantation with survival time over 2 years; of the 5 patients who died within 2 years after the transplantation, 1 survived for more than one year, and 4 for less than 6 months. Two patients died from invasive fungal infection, two from aGVHD and one from cGVHD-induced multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: Anti-CD25 mAb combined with ATG has good therapeutic effect on steroid-resistant sever aGVHD and may help achieve high complete remission rate and long-term survival in leukemic patients after UD-HSCT.","['Ye, Chang-xiong', 'Sun, Jing', 'Liu, Qi-fa', 'Qu, Hong', 'Xu, Dan', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Meng, Fan-yi']","['Ye CX', 'Sun J', 'Liu QF', 'Qu H', 'Xu D', 'Zhang Y', 'Meng FY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Male', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2008/12/31 09:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2008/12/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2008 Dec;28(12):2224-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of this disease is unclear, and there is no definitive treatment. We describe a 71-yr-old patient with stable chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and NSF who presented with hypercalcemia in 2006. Before onset of renal insufficiency in 2002, serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels were normal. In 2004, the patient began hemodialysis, and he was diagnosed with NSF in 2005, shortly after undergoing an MRI with gadolinium contrast administration. Over the next 6 mo, albumin-corrected serum total calcium levels rose from 9.9 to 13.1 mg/dl (normal range, 8.5-10.5 mg/dl) with normal serum phosphorus levels. On admission in September 2006, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D] levels were elevated at 130.7 pg/ml (normal range, 25.1-66.1 pg/ml).

METHODS: K562/ A02 cells were transient transfected with HMGB1- small interference RNA(siRNA) vector, and the levels of HMGB1 gene differential expression pre-and post-transfection were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of ADM on K562/A02 was determined by WST-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The release of Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm was assayed by Western blotting. Activity of Caspase-3 was assayed with a Caspase Colorimetric Assay Kit. RESULTS: (1) The HMGB1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in HMGB1 siRNA transfected K562/A02 cells were decreased by 86% and 71% respectively compared with control. (2) Suppression of HMGB1 by siRNA in K562/A02 cells resulted in a reversal of the resistance to ADM, and decreased IC50 from (4.83 +/- 0.08) microg/ml to (1.33 +/- 0.10) microg/ml. 1 microg/ml and 5 microg/ml of ADM treatment increased cell apoptotic rate by 27% and 32% respectively. (3) HMGB1 suppression in K562/A02 cells significantly promoted ADM- induced Smac/DIABLO release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and increased the activities of Caspase-3. CONCLUSION: HMGB1 gene silence can enhance sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADM and reverse cell resistant to ADM.","['Xie, Min', 'Kang, Rui', 'Yu, Yan', 'Zhu, Shan', 'He, Yu-Lei', 'Xu, Wang-Qiong', 'Tang, Dao-Lin', 'Cao, Li-Zhi']","['Xie M', 'Kang R', 'Yu Y', 'Zhu S', 'He YL', 'Xu WQ', 'Tang DL', 'Cao LZ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Gene Silencing', 'HMGB1 Protein/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics']",2008/12/31 09:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2008/12/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Aug;29(8):549-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The MK gene expression levels were detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-RT-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) of 181 acute leukemia (AL) patients and 31 normal controls. RESULTS: MK gene was expressed in all AL patients, normal controls and AL patients in complete remission (CR). Compared with that in control group and CR group, MK gene expression was significantly increased in AL patients (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). No statistical difference was found between CR group and control group. The expression of MK showed a notable increase in all B-ALL subtypes (including pro-B-ALL, common-B-ALL and pre-B-ALL) as well as in adult and childhood B-ALL patients (P < 0.01). Moreover, the gene expression in B-ALL was also significantly higher than that in TALL, HAL and FAB subtypes of AML (P < 0.01).

METHODS: The C57BL/6 mice splenic NK cells were selected by microbeads, and then expanded in the media containing IL-2 and IL-15. The killing activity of NK cells was detected. In the leukemia mouse model, recipients (BALB/c) were intravenously inoculated with EL9611 leukemia cells 8 days before transplantation. Lethally irradiated BALB/c recipient mice were transplanted with 5 x 10(6) bone marrow cells (BMCs), or 5 x 10(6) BMCs plus 1 x 10(7) splenocytes with or without 1 x 10(7) activated NK cells. Additionally, NK cell infusion group mice were intraperitoneally injected with a mixture of IL-2 and IL-15 post transplant. Survival time, GVHD occurrence, lineage chimerism, TRBV spectra-typing were observed post transplant. RESULTS: The purity of isolated splenic NK cells was 95.7% - 97.1%. The killing activity of NK cells after activation was increased by 3 times. GVHD did not occurred in allogeneic BMCs infusion group, whereas did from 1 week after transplant in allogeneic BMCs + splenocytes infusion group. The severity of GVHD in total body irradiation (TBI) experimental group was significantly lower than in splenocytes infusion group (P < 0.05). The survival time was 9.5 - 14.0 d in TBI alone conditioning group. In leukemia mouse model, 100 day survival rate was 10% the rest of them were died of leukemia while in experimental group, the more than 100 days survival rate was 80% (P < 0.01). PB NK cells at 2 week post-transplant were 4.8% in experimental group and 2.8% in control group. NK cells recovery in experimental group was earlier than that in control group (P < 0.05). TRBV reconstitution was faster in experimental group than in control group, moreover, the number of TRBV family expression was more in experimental group than in control group which mainly expressed monoclone or oligo-clone.

METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine CML cases received allo-HSCT at our Institute between Nov. 2004 and Nov. 2006. Bcr-abl transcripts levels were monitored from bone marrow samples by Q-RT-PCR in all cases pre-HSCT and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months post HSCT. The median value of bcr-abl at these time points were calculated and compared by Mann-Whitney U test.

The authors' previous in vitro work demonstrated that in mouse cells mouse OSM (mOSM) signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex incorporating the mOSM-specific receptor mOSMRbeta while human OSM (hOSM) and bovine OSM (bOSM) use the mouse LIF receptor mLIFRbeta rather than mOSMRbeta. These in vitro data suggest that prior studies in mouse systems with hOSM or bOSM (the usual molecules used in early studies) reflect LIF rather than OSM biology. The current work assessed whether or not this divergence in actions among these three OSMs also occurs in vivo in mouse models. Adult female (C57BL/6J x DBA/2J) F(1) mice were engineered to stably overexpress mOSM, hOSM, or bOSM by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (n = 10 or more per group). After 4 weeks, molecular and hematologic profiles and anatomic phenotypes in multiple organs were assessed by standard techniques. Animals overexpressing either hOSM or bOSM had an identical phenotype resembling that associated with LIF activation, including significant hematologic abnormalities (anemia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and thrombocytosis); weight loss; profound enlargement (lymph node, spleen) and/or structural reorganization (lymph node, spleen, thymus) of lymphoid organs; and severe osteosclerosis. In contrast, mice overexpressing mOSM did not develop hematologic changes, weight loss, or osteosclerosis and exhibited more modest and anatomically distinct restructuring of lymphoid organs. These data indicate that activities imputed to OSM and the mOSMRbeta signaling pathway using in vitro and in vivo mouse experimental systems are unique to mOSM.","['Juan, T S-C', 'Bolon, B', 'Lindberg, R A', 'Sun, Y', 'Van, G', 'Fletcher, F A']","['Juan TS', 'Bolon B', 'Lindberg RA', 'Sun Y', 'Van G', 'Fletcher FA']","['Department of Functional Genomics, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA 91320, USA. tjuan@amgen.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Osmr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cattle', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'Oncostatin M/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/*metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/pathology']",2008/12/30 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2008/12/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']","['46/1/124 [pii]', '10.1354/vp.46-1-124 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2009 Jan;46(1):124-37. doi: 10.1354/vp.46-1-124.,10.1354/vp.46-1-124 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein synthesis inhibitor acetoxycycloheximide (Ac-CHX) has been previously shown to induce rapid apoptosis mediated by the release of cytochrome c in human leukemia Jurkat cells. In this study, the novel molecular mechanism that links caspase-8 to the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins has been identified. Jurkat cells deficient in caspase-8 were more resistant to Ac-CHX than wild-type Jurkat cells and manifested decreased apoptosis induction and caspase activation as well as inefficient release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into the cytosol. In contrast to Fas ligand stimulation, the general caspase inhibitor barely prevented the mitochondrial release of these pro-apoptotic proteins in Ac-CHX-treated cells, suggesting that caspase-8 activity is dispensable for triggering the mitochondrial pathway in Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this notion, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells reconstituted with catalytically inactive caspase-8 became sensitive to Ac-CHX and exhibited apoptosis, caspase activation, the liberation of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol, and Bak conformational change as efficiently as wild-type Jurkat cells. Unlike caspase-3, -6, -7, and -9, a small but significant portion of caspase-8 was found to localize in mitochondria before and after exposure to Ac-CHX. These results clearly demonstrate that caspase-8 is able to mediate the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic proteins in a manner independent of its proteolytic activity in Ac-CHX-induced apoptosis.","['Kadohara, Kimiko', 'Nagumo, Michiko', 'Asami, Shun', 'Tsukumo, Yoshinori', 'Sugimoto, Hikaru', 'Igarashi, Masayuki', 'Nagai, Kazuo', 'Kataoka, Takao']","['Kadohara K', 'Nagumo M', 'Asami S', 'Tsukumo Y', 'Sugimoto H', 'Igarashi M', 'Nagai K', 'Kataoka T']","['Center for Biological Resources and Informatics and Department of Bioengineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 4259 Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226-8501.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'UX3Y1I395S (acetoxycycloheximide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2008/12/30 09:00,2009/05/12 09:00,['2008/12/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)70871-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M808523200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Feb 27;284(9):5478-87. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M808523200.

Preparation and adoptive transfusion of tumor-specific T cells from HLA-mismatched donors might be expected to circumvent CTL tolerance to the tumor. In this study, a soluble, divalent HLA-A2 molecule was constructed with the Fc part of human IgG1 and was pulsed with a peptide related to melanoma tyrosinase 368-376 [Tyr(368-376) (Tyr)] to form the Tyr/HLA-A2 dimer, which allowed loading onto monocytes via interaction of the Fc and FcR. The HLA-A2-negative (HLA-A2-ve) monocytes loaded with the Tyr/HLA-A2 dimer acted as allo-APC with copies of a single allogeneic epitope. After coculture of the HLA-A2-ve PBLs and autologous monocytes loaded with the dimer, CD8+ cells in the coculture show an obvious proliferation and increased frequency of Tyr/HLA-A2 tetramer-stained cells. The sorted Tyr/HLA-A2 tetramer-positive CD8+ cells display an elevated cytotoxic activity against HLA-A2-positive melanoma cells expressing tyrosinase endogenously (i.e., SK-Mel-5) but little against tyrosinase-negative melanoma cells (i.e., A375).

In the present study, we demonstrate that an active metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), promotes cell death in Jurkat leukemic T cells by counteracting mitogen-mediated repression of Fas-induced apoptosis. The effect of RA was dose-dependent, and at the optimal concentration of 1 muM, repression of Fas-induced cell death by the mitogens 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or Con A was reversed by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively. RA promoted apoptosis rather than necrosis, as judged by analysis of cell morphology, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and DNA fragmentation. TPA-mediated protection from Fas-induced apoptosis is dependent on ERK and NF-kappaB. However, analyses of ERK and NF-kappaB activities and expression of target genes indicated that RA-mediated counteraction of the protective effect of TPA did not involve negative crosstalk with ERK or NF-kappaB survival pathways. RA-induced cell death was accompanied by enhanced cleavage of procaspase-3, -6, and -8, as well as enhanced cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor 45. Interestingly, RA-mediated cleavage of procaspase-8 occurred very early and before any effect of RA could be detected on procaspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RA might act at the level of the Fas death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Indeed, DISC immunoprecipitation studies revealed that RA treatment reversed the inhibitory effect of TPA on CH11-induced recruitment and processing of procaspase-8 at the DISC. In conclusion, we have identified a role of RA in abrogating mitogen-mediated repression of Fas DISC assembly, thus enhancing Fas-induced apoptosis in leukemic T cells.","['Engedal, Nikolai', 'Auberger, Patrick', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil']","['Engedal N', 'Auberger P', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. nikolai.engedal@rr-research.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/prevention & control', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2008/12/30 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2008/12/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['jlb.1107790 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1107790 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Mar;85(3):469-80. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1107790.

Using this approach, the classification model was constructed for four microarray datasets, leukemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer, and the accuracies of classification with k-nearest neighbor were all more than 80%. And in the breast cancer dataset, we succeeded in finding genes that are specific in a cluster consisting of 38 control group samples. These results indicate the importance of sample clustering before classification model construction.","['Kawamura, Takashi', 'Mutoh, Hironori', 'Tomita, Yasuyuki', 'Kato, Ryuji', 'Honda, Hiroyuki']","['Kawamura T', 'Mutoh H', 'Tomita Y', 'Kato R', 'Honda H']","['Department of Biotechnology, School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Biosci Bioeng,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,100888800,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2008/12/30 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2008/12/30 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S1389-1723(08)70211-1 [pii]', '10.1263/jbb.106.442 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biosci Bioeng. 2008 Nov;106(5):442-8. doi: 10.1263/jbb.106.442.,10.1263/jbb.106.442 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Bortezomib showed limited single-agent activity for patients with leukemia. Here, we report for the first time that Bortezomib up-regulated a novel antiapoptotic protein, BAG3, in human leukemic cells. BAG3 gene knockdown with shRNA greatly potentiated the generation of apoptosis by Bortezomib in leukemia cells. Furthermore, BAG3 silencing enhanced the antitumor activity of Bortezomib dramatically in a nude mouse model. Our results indicate that knocking down BAG3 gene is a promising new approach to enhance the therapeutic potency of Bortezomib in leukemia.","['Liu, Peng', 'Xu, Bei', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Lu, Hua']","['Liu P', 'Xu B', 'Li J', 'Lu H']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, People's Republic of China. liupeng8888@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAG3 protein, human)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Mice', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2008/12/30 09:00,2009/03/11 09:00,['2008/12/30 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-5793(08)01023-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2008.12.032 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2009 Jan 22;583(2):401-6. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2008.12.032.

Further, recently performed clinical radioimmunotherapy studies with [(90)Y]Y-anti-CD66 proved to be suitable for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Before radioimmunotherapy with [(90)Y]Y-anti-CD66, dosimetric estimations are required to minimize radiotoxicity and determine individual applicable activities. Planar imaging, using gamma-emitting radionuclides, is conventionally carried out to estimate the absorbed organ doses. In contrast, immuno-PET (positron emission tomography) enables the quantification of anti-CD66 accumulation and provides better spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore, in this study, a semiautomated radiosynthesis of [(18)F]F-anti-CD66 was developed, using the (18)F-acylation agent, N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB). As a proof of concept, an intraindividual comparison between PET and conventional scintigraphy, using (18)F- and (99m)Tc-labeled anti-CD66 in 1 patient with high-risk leukemia, is presented. Both labeled antibodies displayed a similar distribution pattern with high preferential uptake in bone marrow. Urinary excretion of [(18)F]F-anti-CD66 was increased and bone marrow uptake reduced, in comparison to [(99m)Tc]Tc-anti-CD66. Nevertheless, PET-based dosimetry with [(18)F]F-anti-CD66 could provide additional information to support conventional scintigraphy. Moreover, [(18)F]F-anti-CD66 is ideally suited for bone marrow imaging using PET.","['Neumaier, Bernd', 'Mottaghy, Felix M', 'Buck, Andreas K', 'Glatting, Gerhard', 'Blumstein, Norbert M', 'Mahren, Bettina', 'Vogg, Andreas T J', 'Reske, Sven N']","['Neumaier B', 'Mottaghy FM', 'Buck AK', 'Glatting G', 'Blumstein NM', 'Mahren B', 'Vogg AT', 'Reske SN']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Ulm, Germany. bernd.neumaier@nf.mpg.de <bernd.neumaier@nf.mpg.de>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fluorine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Fluorine Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', '*Positron-Emission Tomography', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/12/30 09:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2008/12/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2008.0512 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2008 Dec;23(6):819-24. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2008.0512.,10.1089/cbr.2008.0512 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, treatment with IQDMA inhibited phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Src, Bcr-Abl, and Janus-activated kinase (JAK2) in a time-dependent manner. IQDMA also degraded JAK2 protein. Moreover, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling were also blocked by IQDMA. However, IQDMA did not inhibit other oncogenic and tumor survival pathways such as those mediated by Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, IQDMA upregulated the expression of p21 and p27 and downregulated the expression of cyclin D1, myeloid cell leukemia-1(Mcl-1), Bcl-X(L), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Taken together, these results indicate that IQDMA causes significant induction of apoptosis in K562 cells via downregulation of EGFR, Src, Bcr-Abl, JAK2, and STAT5 signaling and modulation of p21, p27, cyclin D1, Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), and VEGF proteins.

Current gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors do not control the site of insertion into the genome, hence, the possibility of disruption of the target cell genome. Risk related to viral insertions is linked to the number of insertions of the transgene into the cellular DNA, as has been demonstrated for replication competent and replication deficient retroviruses in experiments. At high number of insertions per cell, cell transformation due to vector induced activation of proto-oncogenes is more likely to occur, in particular since more than one transforming event is needed for oncogenesis.

We describe methods capable of detecting low levels of virus contamination and discuss the current regulatory guidelines for screening gene therapy products intended for human use.","['Sastry, Lakshmi', 'Cornetta, Kenneth']","['Sastry L', 'Cornetta K']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Serial Passage', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",2008/12/27 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/12/27 09:00'],"['2008/12/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-409-4_17 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;506:243-63. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-409-4_17.,10.1007/978-1-59745-409-4_17 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are also significant implications for the study of T cell biology (J Exp Med 191:2031-2037, 2000). Currently, there are three types of vectors that are commonly used for introducing genes into human primary T cells: oncoretroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, and naked DNA. Oncoretroviral vectors transduce and integrate only in dividing cells. However, it has been shown that extended ex vivo culture, required by oncoretroviral-mediated gene transfer, may alter the biologic properties of T cells (Nat Med 4:775-780, 1998; Int Immunol 9:1073- 1083, 1997; Hum Gene Ther 11:1151-1164, 2001; Blood 15:1165-1173, 2002; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 1994). HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors have been shown to transduce a variety of slowly dividing or nondividing cells, including unstimulated T lymphocytes (Blood 96:1309-1316, 2000; Gene Ther 7:596-604, 2000; Blood 101:2167-2174, 2002; Hum Gene Ther 14:1089-1105, 2003). However, achieving effective gene transfer and expression using lentivirus vectors can be complex, and there is at least a perceived risk associated with clinical application of a vector based on a human pathogen (i.e., HIV-1). Recently it has been found that oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors show a preference for integration into regulatory sequences and active genes, respectively (Cell 110:521-529, 2002; Science 300:1749-1751, 2003). Additionally, insertional mutagenesis has become a serious concern, after several patients treated with an oncoretroviral vector for X-linked SCID developed a leukemia-like syndrome associated with activation of the LMO2 oncogene (Science 302:415-419, 2003). Naked DNA-based genetic engineering of human T lymphocytes also requires T cells to be activated prior to gene transfer (Mol Ther 1:49-55, 2000; Blood 101:1637-1644, 2003; Blood 107:2643-2652, 2006). In addition, random integration by electroporation is of low efficiency. We have recently reported that the Sleeping Beauty transposon system can efficiently mediate stable transgene expression in human primary T cells without prior T cell activation (Blood 107:483-491, 2006). This chapter describes methodology for the introduction of SB transposons into human T cell cultures with subsequent integration and stable long-term expression at noticeably high efficiency for a nonviral gene transfer system.","['Huang, Xin', 'Wilber, Andrew', 'McIvor, R Scott', 'Zhou, Xianzheng']","['Huang X', 'Wilber A', 'McIvor RS', 'Zhou X']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Plasmids', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2008/12/27 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/12/27 09:00'],"['2008/12/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-409-4_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;506:115-26. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-409-4_9.,10.1007/978-1-59745-409-4_9 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the patient developed diarrhea and chronic GVHD of the skin and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia was repeatedly positive, neurological exacerbation was stabilized. Neurological symptoms did not immediately improve after the second and third dose of IVIG. Approximately 50 days after the third dose of IVIG, neurological symptoms improved with the gradual resolution of diarrhea and CMV reactivation.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the antioxidant isoliquiritigenin affects the proliferation and redifferentiation in HL-60 cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric method and trypan blue staining were used to measure cell proliferentiation and survival. The morphological changes, nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) reductive activity, and the CD11b and CD14 surface antigens were used as the biomarkers of redifferentiation of HL-60 cells. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) level was detected by a fluorescent probe, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) inhibited the cell proliferation and decreased the iROS levels in a dose-dependent manner, while the treatment did not increase the lethality rate. After 72 h treatment with 10 microg/ml ISL, a typical differentiated morphology was observed in HL-60 cells, including the decrease of karyoplasmic ratio and the increase of kidney-shape nuclear cells. The positive rate (%) of CD11b (26.4+/-3.90 vs 7.70+/-1.04, P<0.01) and CD14 (20.4+/-2.30 vs 2.63+/-0.133, P<0.01) cells increased significantly. The NBT reductive activity increased 2.3-fold as compared to that of the control group. As an antioxidant, ISL decreased the iROS formation in a dose-dependent manner. All the results indicate that the antioxidant ISL is able to induce the monocytic differentiation in leukemia cells.

In these diseases, there is an increase in DNA damage and a risk of progression to acute leukemia. The molecular mechanisms in myeloproliferative disorders that prevent apoptosis induced by damaged DNA are obscure. METHODS: We searched for abnormalities of the proapoptotic Bcl-x(L) deamidation pathway in primary cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or polycythemia vera, myeloproliferative disorders associated with the BCR-ABL fusion kinase and the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation, respectively. RESULTS: The Bcl-x(L) deamidation pathway was inhibited in myeloid cells, but not T cells, in patients with CML or polycythemia vera. DNA damage did not increase levels of the amiloride-sensitive sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE-1), intracellular pH, Bcl-x(L) deamidation, and apoptosis. Inhibition of the pathway was reversed by enforced alkalinization or overexpression of NHE-1, leading to a restoration of apoptosis. In patients with CML, the pathway was blocked in CD34+ progenitor cells and mature myeloid cells. Imatinib or JAK2 inhibitors reversed inhibition of the pathway in cells from patients with CML and polycythemia vera, respectively, but not in cells from a patient with resistance to imatinib because of a mutation in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. CONCLUSIONS: BCR-ABL and mutant JAK2 inhibit the Bcl-x(L) deamidation pathway and the apoptotic response to DNA damage in primary cells from patients with CML or polycythemia vera.","['Zhao, Rui', 'Follows, George A', 'Beer, Philip A', 'Scott, Linda M', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Alexander, Denis R']","['Zhao R', 'Follows GA', 'Beer PA', 'Scott LM', 'Huntly BJ', 'Green AR', 'Alexander DR']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom. rui.zhao@bbsrc.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC9A1 protein, human)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cation Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage/genetics', 'Deamination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*physiology']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]']","['359/26/2778 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0804953 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 25;359(26):2778-89. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0804953.,10.1056/NEJMoa0804953 [doi],,"['8961/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'G116/187/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,['2008 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,,,,,,,

In these studies, we knocked down Meis1 expression by shRNA lentivirus transduction in murine Mll-AF9 leukemia cells. Meis1 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and survival of murine Mll-AF9 leukemia cells. We also observed reduced clonogenic capacity and increased monocytic differentiation. The establishment of leukemia in transplantation recipients was significantly delayed by Meis1 knockdown. Gene expression profiling of cells transduced with Meis1 shRNA showed reduced expression of genes associated with cell cycle entry and progression. shRNA-mediated knockdown of MEIS1 in human MLL-fusion gene leukemia cell lines resulted in reduced cell growth. These results show that MEIS1 expression is important for MLL-rearranged leukemias and suggest that MEIS1 promotes cell-cycle entry.

In most cases, these abnormalities resolve in the first few months to years of life. However, sometimes the TMD represents a premalignant disease that develops into acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL), usually in association with acquired GATA1 mutations. To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities, we analyzed the hematopoietic development of the Ts1Cje mouse model of DS. Our analyses identified defects in mature blood cells, including macrocytosis and anemia, as well as abnormalities in fetal liver and bone marrow stem and progenitor cell function. Despite these defects, the Ts1Cje mice do not develop disease resembling either TMD or AMKL, and this was not altered by a loss of function allele of Gata1. Thus, loss of Gata1 and partial trisomy of chromosome 21 orthologs, when combined, do not appear to be sufficient to induce TMD or AMKL-like phenotypes in mice.","['Carmichael, Catherine L', 'Majewski, Ian J', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Hewitt, Chelsee A', 'Scott, Hamish S']","['Carmichael CL', 'Majewski IJ', 'Alexander WS', 'Metcalf D', 'Hilton DJ', 'Hewitt CA', 'Scott HS']","['Molecular Medicine, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia. carmichael@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/*etiology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytosis/pathology']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37634-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-161422 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Feb 26;113(9):1929-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-161422.

To build on these results, we examined the effect of combining tipifarnib with other agents. Tipifarnib inhibited signaling downstream of the farnesylated small G protein Rheb and synergistically enhanced etoposide-induced antiproliferative effects in lymphohematopoietic cell lines and acute myelogenous leukemia isolates. We subsequently conducted a phase 1 trial of tipifarnib plus etoposide in adults over 70 years of age who were not candidates for conventional therapy. A total of 84 patients (median age, 77 years) received 224 cycles of oral tipifarnib (300-600 mg twice daily for 14 or 21 days) plus oral etoposide (100-200 mg daily on days 1-3 and 8-10). Dose-limiting toxicities occurred with 21-day tipifarnib. Complete remissions were achieved in 16 of 54 (30%) receiving 14-day tipifarnib versus 5 of 30 (17%) receiving 21-day tipifarnib. Complete remissions occurred in 50% of two 14-day tipifarnib cohorts: 3A (tipifarnib 600, etoposide 100) and 8A (tipifarnib 400, etoposide 200).

However, in this study, we have demonstrated that replication of genome-length hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (O strain of genotype 1b) was notably inhibited by ATO at submicromolar concentrations without cell toxicity. RNA replication of HCV-JFH1 (genotype 2a) and the release of core protein into the culture supernatants were also inhibited by ATO after the HCV infection. To clarify the mechanism of the anti-HCV activity of ATO, we examined whether or not PML is associated with this anti-HCV activity, since PML is known to be a target of ATO. Interestingly, we observed the cytoplasmic translocation of PML after treatment with ATO. However, ATO still inhibited the HCV RNA replication even in the PML knockdown cells, suggesting that PML is dispensable for the anti-HCV activity of ATO. In contrast, we found that N-acetyl-cysteine, an antioxidant and glutathione precursor, completely and partially eliminated the anti-HCV activity of ATO after 24 h and 72 h of treatment, respectively. In this context, it is worth noting that we found an elevation of intracellular superoxide anion radical, but not hydrogen peroxide, and the depletion of intracellular glutathione in the ATO-treated cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that ATO inhibits the HCV RNA replication through modulation of the glutathione redox system and oxidative stress.","['Kuroki, Misao', 'Ariumi, Yasuo', 'Ikeda, Masanori', 'Dansako, Hiromichi', 'Wakita, Takaji', 'Kato, Nobuyuki']","['Kuroki M', 'Ariumi Y', 'Ikeda M', 'Dansako H', 'Wakita T', 'Kato N']","['Department of Tumor Virology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1, Shikata-cho, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Hepacivirus/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/drug effects', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/02/17 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01840-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01840-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Mar;83(5):2338-48. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01840-08.

In Argentina, genetic selection of cattle carrying alleles of the bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) DRB3.2 gene associated with BLV-infection resistance, like *0902, emerges as the best additional tool toward controlling virus spread. A potential risk in expanding or segregating BoLA selected populations of cattle is that it might increase susceptibility to other common viruses. Special concern raises the strong association found between low proviral load and low antibody titer against major BLV structural proteins. This phenomenon might depend on host genetic factors influencing other viruses requiring, unlike BLV, strong and long-lasting humoral immune response to prevent infection. In this study, we demonstrate that there is no association among neutralizing antibody titers against foot and mouth disease virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, or bovine herpesvirus type 1 and polymorphism of the BoLA DRB3.2 gene. Conversely, there is strong association between BoLA DRB3.2*0902 and low antibody titers against 2 BLV structural proteins--env gp51 and gag p24--to date, the best BLV resistance marker. There is also significant association between low antibody titers against gp51 and p24 and BoLA DRB3.2*1701 and low antibody titers against p24 and BoLA DRB3.2*1101 or 02. Our data suggest that increasing BoLA-selected BLV-resistant cattle or segregating BoLA-associated alleles to BLV susceptibility would not affect the resistance or the predisposition to bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus type 1, or foot and mouth disease virus infection.","['Juliarena, M A', 'Poli, M', 'Ceriani, C', 'Sala, L', 'Rodriguez, E', 'Gutierrez, S', 'Dolcini, G', 'Odeon, A', 'Esteban, E N']","['Juliarena MA', 'Poli M', 'Ceriani C', 'Sala L', 'Rodriguez E', 'Gutierrez S', 'Dolcini G', 'Odeon A', 'Esteban EN']","['Laboratorio de Virologia del Departamento Sanidad Animal y Medicine Preventiva (SAMP), Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias-Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (FCV-UNCPBA), Pinto 399, (7000) Tandil, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Diarrhea Virus 1, Bovine Viral/immunology', '*Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease/genetics', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus/immunology', 'Genotype', '*HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-0302(09)70341-8 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.2008-1143 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2009 Jan;92(1):375-81. doi: 10.3168/jds.2008-1143.,10.3168/jds.2008-1143 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations both lead to activation of the NOTCH1 pathway and are among the most frequent mutations in T-ALL. We screened 141 adult diagnostic T-ALL samples from patients treated on either the Lymphoblastic Acute Leukemia in Adults (LALA)-94 (n = 87) or the GRAALL-2003 (n = 54) trials. In 88 cases (62%) there were demonstrated NOTCH1 mutations (42% heterodimerization [HD], 10% HD+proline glutamate serine threonine [PEST], 6% PEST, 2% juxtamembrane mutations, 2% transactivation domain [TAD]) and 34 cases (24%) had FBXW7 mutations (21 cases had both NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations); 40 cases (28%) were wild type for both. There was no significant correlation between NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations and clinico-biologic features. Median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 36 versus 17 months (P = .01) and not reached versus 32 months (P = .004) in patients with NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations versus other patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations was an independent good prognostic factor for EFS and OS (P = .02 and P = .01, respectively). These data demonstrate that NOTCH1 pathway activation by either NOTCH1 or FBXW7 mutation identifies a large group of patients with a favorable outcome that could justify individual therapeutic stratification for T-ALL.","['Asnafi, Vahid', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Le Noir, Sandrine', 'Baleydier, Frederic', 'Simon, Arnauld', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Witz, Francis', 'Fagot, Thierry', 'Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Turlure, Pascal', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Vernant, Jean-Paul', 'Daniel, Francis', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Asnafi V', 'Buzyn A', 'Le Noir S', 'Baleydier F', 'Simon A', 'Beldjord K', 'Reman O', 'Witz F', 'Fagot T', 'Tavernier E', 'Turlure P', 'Leguay T', 'Huguet F', 'Vernant JP', 'Daniel F', 'Bene MC', 'Ifrah N', 'Thomas X', 'Dombret H', 'Macintyre E']","['Universite Paris 5 Descartes and Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) and Hematology Department, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Societies, Medical', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39271-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-184069 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 23;113(17):3918-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-184069.

Copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) was identified at chromosomes 10q (3 cases), 11p (3 cases), and 19q (1 case).

DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the impact of CD56 expression in a cohort of 452 newly diagnosed adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients; clinical data were available for 306 patients. Treatment was according to the GMALL study protocols 06/99 and 07/03 stipulating stratification into standard (thymic T-ALL) and high risk (pre- and mature T-ALL) groups. RESULTS: CD56 expression was detected in 63/452 (13.9%) patients. CD56(+) T-ALL were predominantly of non-thymic (pre-T 35%, mature 41%) immunophenotypic subtypes, whereas 53% of the CD56(-) cases were thymic T-ALL (p=0.00002). CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR were significantly more frequently expressed. A clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement was detected in 22/23 CD56(+) ALL. No major clinical differences were observed at presentation. Treatment of CD56(+) ALL resulted in a lower rate of complete remissions (70% vs. 88%) (p=0.001) and a higher rate of resistant disease (21% vs. 8%) (p=0.004). CD56 expression had no significant influence on overall (48% vs. 59%) and disease free survival (67% vs. 57%) at three years. CONCLUSIONS: CD56 is expressed on a subset of adult T-ALL with distinct immunophenotypical features and higher resistance to therapy. Most CD56(+) ALL were treated in the high-risk arm of the GMALL study protocols owing to their non-thymic phenotype. Thus after risk adapted treatment a prognostic impact of CD56 expression was not detectable.","['Fischer, Lars', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Rieder, Harald', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Fischer L', 'Gokbuget N', 'Schwartz S', 'Burmeister T', 'Rieder H', 'Bruggemann M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E']","['Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik III, Berlin. lars.fischer@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*CD56 Antigen', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['haematol.13543 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13543 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Feb;94(2):224-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13543.

In this context costimulation via the CD70/CD27 pathway has been proven essential. CD70 has been reported to be expressed to varying degrees on malignant B cells. However, in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common childhood malignancy, the role of CD70 in stimulation of antileukemic T cell responses has so far not been delineated. Herein we demonstrate that in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia expression of CD70 is low but can be induced upon blast activation via CD40. Both CD70 and CD80/CD86 up-regulated on CD40-stimulated blasts contribute to primary stimulation of T cell proliferation and cytokine production in an additive manner. These two signals also cooperate in the prevention of T cell anergy. In contrast to blockade of CD70 during the effector phase, inhibition of CD70-mediated costimulation during generation of antileukemic T cells prevents effector cell proliferation and reduces their cytotoxic capacity. Modulation of the CD70/CD27 pathway may thus represent a novel therapeutic approach for augmenting magnitude and quality of the antileukemic response in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Glouchkova, Ludmila', 'Ackermann, Birgit', 'Zibert, Andree', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Siepermann, Meinolf', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Goebel, Ulrich', 'Troeger, Anja', 'Dilloo, Dagmar']","['Glouchkova L', 'Ackermann B', 'Zibert A', 'Meisel R', 'Siepermann M', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Goebel U', 'Troeger A', 'Dilloo D']","['Clinic for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'CD27 Ligand/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]']","['182/1/718 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.182.1.718 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Jan 1;182(1):718-25. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.182.1.718.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By multivariable analysis, women had significantly lower relative excess risk (RER) of death for the sites listed above plus multiple myeloma. Women significantly had higher RER of death for biliary tract, bladder and leukaemia. For all cancers combined women had a significant 5% lower RER of death.

The aim of the present study was to examine the antiproliferative and apoptosis inducing activities of AMBAN towards human leukemia HL60 and U937 cells. Further, the molecular mechanism involved in AMBAN-induced apoptosis was investigated. Benzothiazole inhibited the growth and induced programmed cell death of HL60 and U937 cells. In addition, AMBAN elevated the level of reactive oxygen species, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, activated caspases 9 and 3, induced the cytochrome c release and PARP cleavage and led to intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Further, p38 MAPK was associated with the apoptotic activity of AMBAN.

Bisulfite sequencing revealed hypermethylation of a CpG island within the ERG2 promoter region in T-ALL. Treatment of the T-lymphoblastic cell line BE13 with decitabine led to re-expression of ERG2 and pyrosequencing showed concordant DNA hypomethylation, thus confirming a methylation regulated expression of ERG2.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, and pharmacodynamic properties of nilotinib; results of clinical trials in patients with CML, Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs); and potential drug interactions. METHODS: Literature was identified and reviewed using searches of MEDLINE (1966-April 1, 2008), the American Society of Hematology and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts databases (2002-2008 annual meetings/symposia), the European Hematology Association abstracts database (2006-2007 annual meetings), and the American Association for Cancer Research symposia (2000-2007). Search terms included, but were not limited to, nilotinib, AMN107, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, bcr-abl, imatinib resistance, adverse events, pharmacology, and clinical trials. RESULTS: Nilotinib is an orally bioavailable derivative of imatinib with improved specificity toward the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (bcr-abl) viral protooncogene. In preclinical studies, nilotinib was found to have activity against 32 of 33 imatinib-resistant bcr-abl mutations, but not against the T3151 mutation. On pharmacokinetic analysis, T(max) was 3 hours. The calculated t((1/2)) following multiple daily dosing was approximately 17 hours. The main metabolic pathways identified were oxidation and hydroxylation. The parent compound is the circulating component found in serum; the metabolites were not found to contribute to pharmacologic activity. Nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. In 2 Phase II, open-label, single-arm clinical studies, nilotinib was found to be beneficial in patients with CML that was imatinib resistant or intolerant. Overall, 58% of patients with CML-CP achieved a major cytogenetic response; 42%, a complete cytogenetic response; and 77%, a complete hematologic response (CHR). At 18 months, the estimated overall survival rate was 91%. Of patients whose disease had progressed to AP, nilotinib was associated with major cytogenetic response in 32%; complete cytogenetic response in 19%; and CHR in 30%. At 12 months, an estimated 56% of patients lacked progression of disease, and the estimated overall survival rate was 82%. Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. The most common toxicities attributable to nilotinib include rash, pruritus, nausea, fatigue, headache, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting. Grade 3/4 toxicities (> or = 10%) have included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, elevated lipase, hyperglycemia, and hypophosphatemia. Nilotinib has been associated with a prolonged QT interval, and sudden death has been reported. The FDA-approved regimen of nilotinib is 400 mg PO BID on an empty stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib is an oral second-generation bcr-abl TKI indicated for the treatment of imatinib resistant or -intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and -AP in adults. Positive clinical activity and tolerability have been reported in clinical trials. Clinical data on off-label indications and in patients with Ph+ ALL and GIST continue to emerge.","['Deremer, David L', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Natarajan, Kavita']","['Deremer DL', 'Ustun C', 'Natarajan K']","['Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912, USA. dderemer@mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Structure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/02/24 09:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(08)00408-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2008 Nov;30(11):1956-75. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.11.014.,10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.11.014 [doi],,,,,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: LIF may be a useful treatment for PD by up-regulating the re-expression of NPCs, which may represent the neuroprotection mechanism of LIF.","['Liu, Juan', 'Zang, Dawei']","['Liu J', 'Zang D']","['Microbiology Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin 300192, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neurol Res,Neurological research,7905298,"['0 (Adrenergic Agents)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '8HW4YBZ748 (Oxidopamine)']",IM,"['Adrenergic Agents/toxicity', 'Adult Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxidopamine/toxicity', 'Parkinson Disease/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Substantia Nigra/drug effects/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/12/26 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2008/12/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ner1680 [pii]', '10.1179/174313209X382368 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurol Res. 2009 Sep;31(7):681-6. doi: 10.1179/174313209X382368.

There is a tendency toward a higher incidence of gliomas in highly developed, industrialized countries. Some reports indicate that Caucasians have a higher incidence than African or Asian populations. With the exception of pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I), the prognosis of glioma patients is still poor. Fewer than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, older age being the most significant and consistent prognostic factor of poorer outcome. Gliomas are components of several inherited tumor syndromes, but the prevalence of these syndromes is very low. Many environmental and lifestyle factors including several occupations, environmental carcinogens, and diet have been reported to be associated with an elevated glioma risk, but the only factor unequivocally associated with an increased risk is therapeutic X-irradiation. In particular, children treated with X-irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia show a significantly elevated risk of developing gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, often within 10 years after therapy. Significant correlation between G:C --> A:T transitions in the TP53 gene and promoter methylation of the O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene in glio-mas have been reported in several studies, suggesting the possible involvement of O6-methylguanine DNA adducts, which may be produced by exogenous or endogenous alkylating agents in the development of gliomas.","['Ohgaki, Hiroko']",['Ohgaki H'],"['Pathology Group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Diet/adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2008/12/25 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/12/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;472:323-42. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_14.,10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_14 [doi],,,,,,,147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are only few known risk factors of childhood leukemia (sex, age, race, exposure to ionizing radiation, and certain congenital diseases, such as Down syndrome and neurofibromatosis), which account for only 10% of the childhood leukemia cases. Several lines of evidence suggest that childhood leukemia may be more due to environmental rather than genetic factors, although genes may play modifying roles. Human and animal studies showed that the development of childhood leukemia is a two-step process that requires a prenatal initiating event(s) plus a postnatal promoting event(s). Despite a substantial public health effort to reduce cigarette smoking, a large proportion of the US and world population still smoke. Tobacco smoke contains at least 60 known human or animal carcinogens, with the major chemical classes being volatile hydrocarbons, aldehydes, aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrosamines; among these chemicals, only benzene is an established leukemogen, although other chemicals in the tobacco could interact with one another in a complex way to jointly attain a significant carcinogenic effect on the development of leukemia. Although tobacco smoke is an established risk factor for adult myeloid leukemia, the studies of association between parental smoking and childhood leukemia have produced inconsistent results. The majority of the studies on maternal smoking and childhood leukemia did not find a significant positive association and some even reported an inverse association. In contrast to studies of maternal smoking, studies of paternal smoking and childhood leukemia reported more positive associations but only by less than half of the studies. Future directions to be considered for improving the study of parental smoking and childhood leukemia are: 1) consider all sources of benzene exposure in addition to smoking, including occupational exposure and traffic exhausts; 2) childhood leukemia is a heterogeneous disease and epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia can be greatly improved by grouping childhood leukemia into more homogeneous groups by molecular techniques (e.g., structural and numerical chromosomal changes); and 3) assess gene-environment interaction. It is hoped that through the continual effort, more will be uncovered regarding the causes of childhood leukemia. In the meantime, more effort should be spent on educating the parents to quit smoking, because parental smoking is known to affect many childhood diseases (e.g., asthma, respiratory tract infection, and otitis media) that are much more prevalent than childhood leukemia.","['Chang, Jeffrey S']",['Chang JS'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Fetus/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mutagens/toxicity', '*Parents', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects']",2008/12/25 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/12/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;472:103-37. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_5.,10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_5 [doi],,,,,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m(2) fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m(2) cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT.

Although impressive biologic advance has increased understanding of leukemogenesis, we know little regarding the pathogenic events leading to the initiation and progression of this disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as a class of small, non-protein-coding RNA molecules that can regulate the expression of many genes. The evolutionarily conserved small molecules play important roles in cellular development and function, through mediation of target gene repression. There is significant evidence showing that miRNAs play an important role in disease, especially in oncogenesis. Aberrant expression of miRNAs appears to be a common feature of haematological malignancies. Since the discovery of miR-15 and miR-16 in CLL, much effect has been done to investigate the small molecule in leukemia. Several research groups have shown differences in miRNA expression between normal and malignant cells in leukemia. So miRNAs may be involved in leukemia pathogenesis. Despite the recognition of their synthesis, we know little about their exact molecular function and the identifications of their target genes. Some targets of miRNAs are antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl2 and Tcl1. MiRNAs to these genes are natural antagonists and may be also applied in leukemia therapy. This article reviews the common science supporting miRNAs and their potential target genes in leukemia pathogenesis.","['Dong, Chunjuan', 'Ji, Min', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Dong C', 'Ji M', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/12/25 09:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2008/12/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['7333 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.3.7333 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Feb;8(3):200-5. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.3.7333.

It is found only in the animal kingdom and appears to arise first in insects. In the Drosophila genus, the Daxx orthologs are much larger than those in other species. Here we show that in addition to a conserved core of approximately 200 residues, Daxx possesses several conserved domains and two essentially invariable short SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), each located at one or the other terminus of the protein. Both can independently interact with SUMO. The Daxx I7/733K double mutant with one mutation in each of the two SIMs no longer interacts with SUMO. Daxx interacts with Ubc9 and this interaction strictly requires at least one SIM. Interestingly, the Ubc9 H20D mutation that abolishes non-covalent Ubc9-SUMO interaction also interrupts Daxx-Ubc9 interaction. Thus, SUMO serves as the intermediate for Daxx-Ubc9 interaction. Surprisingly, Daxx I7/733K double mutant could still colocalize with PML. Furthermore, wt Daxx also strongly colocalizes with PMLDeltaS mutant, in which all three sumoylation sites are mutated, whereas PMLDeltaS only weakly colocalizes with Daxx I7/733K mutant, suggesting that SIM-SUMO interaction is not essential for but enhances PML-Daxx interaction. Remarkably, Daxx strongly stimulates c-Jun-mediated transcription and both SIMs are required for this stimulation. PML also activates c-Jun, which requires all three sumoylation sites. Coexpression of Daxx and PML revealed that they independently regulate c-Jun, with Daxx exerting a dominant role. These results suggest that the conserved SIMs are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions that underlie Daxx's diverse cellular functions.","['Santiago, Aleixo', 'Godsey, Adam C', 'Hossain, Jamil', 'Zhao, Lisa Y', 'Liao, Daiqing']","['Santiago A', 'Godsey AC', 'Hossain J', 'Zhao LY', 'Liao D']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, 1376 Mowry Road, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Daxx protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', '*Conserved Sequence', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*metabolism', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism']",2008/12/25 09:00,2009/02/26 09:00,['2008/12/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [medline]']","['7493 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.1.7493 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Jan 1;8(1):76-87. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.1.7493.,,,['CA 092236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our result showed that urinary Ni in acute leukaemia patients (ALL: 68.40 +/- 133.98, AML: 41.48 +/- 76.31 ng/mg creatinine) was significantly higher than that in controls (62.47 +/- 124.90 vs 17.63 +/- 46.17 ng/mg creatinine, P < 0.05).

Previous studies showed that the mechanism of action of disaccharide 1 involves three steps: (i) deacetylation by carboxyesterases, (ii) action as a biosynthetic intermediate for downstream enzymes involved in sLe(X) assembly, and (iii) generation of several glycans related to sLe(X). In this report, we show that GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta-O-naphthalenemethanol binds to the acceptor site of human beta1-4-galactosyltransferase much like the acceptor trisaccharide, GlcNAcbeta1-2Manbeta1-6Man, which is present on N-linked glycans. The 4'-deoxy analog, in which the acceptor hydroxyl group was replaced by -H, did not act as a substrate but instead acted as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The acetylated form of this compound inhibited sLe(X) formation in U937 monocytic leukemia cells, suggesting that it had inhibitory activity in vivo as well. A series of synthetic acetylated analogs of 1 containing -H, -F, -N(3), -NH(2), or -OCH(3) instead of the hydroxyl groups at C-3'- and C-4'-positions of the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue also blocked sLe(X) formation in cells. The reduction of sLe(X) by the 4'-deoxy analog also diminished experimental tumor metastasis by Lewis lung carcinoma in vivo. These data suggest that nonsubstrate disaccharides have therapeutic potential through their ability to bind to glycosyltransferases in vivo and to alter glycan-dependent pathologic processes.","['Brown, Jillian R', 'Yang, Feng', 'Sinha, Anjana', 'Ramakrishnan, Boopathy', 'Tor, Yitzhak', 'Qasba, Pradman K', 'Esko, Jeffrey D']","['Brown JR', 'Yang F', 'Sinha A', 'Ramakrishnan B', 'Tor Y', 'Qasba PK', 'Esko JD']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Glycobiology Research and Training Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Selectins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (beta1,4-galactosyltransferase, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Disaccharides/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Galactosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Selectins/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2008/12/25 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2008/12/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)70954-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M805782200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Feb 20;284(8):4952-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M805782200.

Failure of either the hematocrit or the platelet count to correlate with thrombotic events is a peculiar conundrum of the MPDs. Asymptomatic thrombocytosis in young MPD patients with no cardiovascular risk factors does not require treatment. It is also undisputed that lowering the platelet count reduces the incidence of microvascular events in MPD patients. At the same time, no study to date has demonstrated that platelet count reduction prolongs survival in MPD patients. Agents such as hydroxyurea, busulfan, IFN-alpha and anagrelide, have been used to reduce an elevated platelet count and decrease thrombohemorrhagic events in at-risk patients with thrombocytosis associated with an MPD. When treatment is required, it makes sense to use drugs that are not myelotoxic or mutagenic. Based on the Primary Thrombocythaemia 1 study, hydroxyurea is the treatment of choice for thrombocytosis-associated transient ischemic attacks. However, hydroxyurea does not prevent venous thrombosis, is not more effective in preventing arterial thrombosis than anagrelide and its long-term safety is not established. Therefore, unless curative therapy is planned, one should use the least myelotoxic agent when platelet count reduction is required. In this regard, anagrelide can be considered a first-line drug. With regard to long-term safety of anagrelide, the EMEA has required close monitoring of the safety points identified in future Periodic Safety Update Reports and in a Post Authorisation Safety Study in the EU, which will focus especially on cardiovascular events and acute leukemia. In this article, we review anagrelide pharmacology, the physiology of thrombopoiesis, the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis and the management of patients with an elevated platelet count.","['Emadi, Ashkan', 'Spivak, Jerry L']","['Emadi A', 'Spivak JL']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytosis/complications/*drug therapy']",2008/12/25 09:00,2009/03/03 09:00,['2008/12/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14737140.9.1.37 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2009 Jan;9(1):37-50. doi: 10.1586/14737140.9.1.37.,10.1586/14737140.9.1.37 [doi],,,,,,,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas binding of human AML cells to endothelial cells (ECs) through E-selectin has been shown to occur using classical adhesion assays, little is known about the ability of endothelial P-selectin to support this process. We therefore characterized the ability of AML blasts and KG-1 cells to bind to endothelial selectin type ligands. Flow cytometry revealed that, in addition to various integrin adhesion receptors, AML cells regularly express the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL)-1, a ligand for P- and E-selectin on ECs. In parallel flow chambers, AML cells both rolled and adhered to TNF-alpha pretreated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Pretreatment of HUVECs with anti-P- or anti-E-selectin function blocking antibodies significantly reduced both, rolling and subsequent arrest of primary AML cells. Intravital microscopy of i.v. injected fluorescence-labeled KG-1 cells into P-selectin deficient or wild type mice confirmed a significant role of endothelial P-selectin in the binding of human primary AML cells to ECs also in vivo.

Since doxorubicin (DX) and methotrexate (MTX) are the two most important drugs for high-grade osteosarcoma (OS) treatment, the aim of this study was to identify genes gained or amplified in six DX- and eight MTX-resistant variants of the human OS cell lines U-2OS and Saos-2, and to get insights into the mechanisms underlying the amplification processes. Comparative genomic hybridization techniques identified amplification of MDR1 in all six DX-resistant and of DHFR in three MTX-resistant U-2OS variants. In addition, progressive gain of MLL was detected in the four U-2OS variants with higher resistance levels either to DX or MTX, whereas gain of MYC was found in all Saos-2 MTX-resistant variants and the U-2OS variant with the highest resistance level to DX. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that MDR1 was amplified in U-2OS and Saos-2/DX-resistant variants manifested as homogeneously staining regions and double minutes, respectively. In U-2OS/MTX-resistant variants, DHFR was amplified in homogeneously staining regions, and was coamplified with MLL in relation to the increase of resistance to MTX. Gene amplification was associated with gene overexpression, whereas gene gain resulted in up-regulated gene expression. These results indicate that resistance to DX and MTX in human OS cell lines is a multigenic process involving gene copy number and expression changes.","['Hattinger, Claudia M', 'Stoico, Giuseppina', 'Michelacci, Francesca', 'Pasello, Michela', 'Scionti, Isabella', 'Remondini, Daniel', 'Castellani, Gastone C', 'Fanelli, Marilu', 'Scotlandi, Katia', 'Picci, Piero', 'Serra, Massimo']","['Hattinger CM', 'Stoico G', 'Michelacci F', 'Pasello M', 'Scionti I', 'Remondini D', 'Castellani GC', 'Fanelli M', 'Scotlandi K', 'Picci P', 'Serra M']","['Laboratorio di Ricerca Oncologica, Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genes, myc', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism']",2008/12/24 09:00,2009/03/17 09:00,['2008/12/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20640 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Apr;48(4):289-309. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20640.,10.1002/gcc.20640 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a 66-year-old male diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL), who showed evidence of rectal bleeding. A CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged spleen, multiple paraaortic and mesenteric lymph nodes, and some diverticular pouching along the antimesenteric border of the pelvic colon. A colonoscopy revealed the presence of multiple polypoid lesions, biopsies of which showed diffuse lymphoid infiltrate without any identifiable follicles. Immunohistochemical analysis combined with a Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) study excluded the diagnosis of MCL. A bone marrow aspiration biopsy demonstrated diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow with low grade lymphocytes that expressed CD 20, CD5 and CD23, with negative BCL-1, t (11; 14) and cyclin D1. A diagnosis of B-cell CLL with kappa light chain restriction was made. Multiple lymphomatous polyposis is considered to be a digestive counterpart to MCL and can therefore be considered as a presentation of MCL.

We reviewed our experiences regarding living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT) in patients with pulmonary complications of HSCT. METHODS: We reviewed and assessed seven patients (age, 6-45 yr) who underwent LDLLT at Okayama University Hospital for pulmonary complications of HSCT (HSCT group). Their characteristics and postoperative results were compared with those of 41 LDLLT without HSCT patients (non-HSCT group). In the HSCT group, indications for LDLLT included bronchiolitis obliterans (n=6) and pulmonary fibrosis (n=1) that had developed after treatments involving HSCT. Preexisting hematologic diseases included acute lymphocyte leukemia (n=4), acute promyelocystic leukemia (n=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1), and aplastic anemia (n=1). RESULTS: In the HSCT group, two patients died due to infectious complications, whereas five are currently alive (an overall survival of 71.4%) without any recurrence of the hematologic diseases (mean follow-up period, 35.7 months). The mean of acute rejection episodes was 1.1 per patient in the HSCT group and 1.8 in the non-HSCT group. One of the seven HSCT (14.4%) and 10 non-HSCT (24.4%) patients have currently developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that LDLLT for patients with respiratory failure because of pulmonary complications of HSCT could be an effective approach with less rejection episodes; however, it has a possibly higher risk of the development of infectious complications.","['Yamane, Masaomi', 'Sano, Yoshifumi', 'Toyooka, Shinichi', 'Okazaki, Megumi', 'Date, Hiroshi', 'Oto, Takahiro']","['Yamane M', 'Sano Y', 'Toyooka S', 'Okazaki M', 'Date H', 'Oto T']","['Department of Cancer and Thoracic Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Living Donors', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/*surgery', 'Lung Transplantation/immunology/mortality/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2008/12/24 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/12/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e318190b0be [doi]', '00007890-200812270-00026 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2008 Dec 27;86(12):1767-70. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e318190b0be.,10.1097/TP.0b013e318190b0be [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we dissect the role of interleukin (IL)-15 in human NK cell development using Rag2(-/-)gamma c(-/-) mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells. Human NK cell reconstitution was intrinsically low in this model because of the poor reactivity to mouse IL-15. Although exogenous human IL-15 (hIL-15) alone made little improvement, IL-15 coupled to IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15R alpha) significantly augmented human NK cells. IL-15-IL-15R alpha complexes induced extensive NK cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in accumulation of CD16(+)KIR(+) NK cells, which was not uniquely dependent on enhanced survival or preferential responsiveness of this subset to IL-15. Human NK cell differentiation in vivo required hIL-15 and progressed in a linear fashion from CD56(hi)CD16(-)KIR(-) to CD56(lo)CD16(+)KIR(-), and finally to CD56(lo)CD16(+)KIR(+). These data provide the first evidence that IL-15 trans-presentation regulates human NK cell homeostasis. Use of hIL-15 receptor agonists generates a robust humanized immune system model to study human NK cells in vivo. IL-15 receptor agonists may provide therapeutic tools to improve NK cell reconstitution after bone marrow transplants, enhance graft versus leukemia effects, and increase the pool of IL-15-responsive cells during immunotherapy strategies.","['Huntington, Nicholas D', 'Legrand, Nicolas', 'Alves, Nuno L', 'Jaron, Barbara', 'Weijer, Kees', 'Plet, Ariane', 'Corcuff, Erwan', 'Mortier, Erwan', 'Jacques, Yannick', 'Spits, Hergen', 'Di Santo, James P']","['Huntington ND', 'Legrand N', 'Alves NL', 'Jaron B', 'Weijer K', 'Plet A', 'Corcuff E', 'Mortier E', 'Jacques Y', 'Spits H', 'Di Santo JP']","['Immunology Department, 2 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U668, 3 INSERM U883, Unite de Regulation Immunitaire et Vaccinologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris 75724, France. nhunting@pasteur.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics', 'Interleukin-15/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2008/12/24 09:00,2009/02/24 09:00,['2008/12/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [medline]']","['jem.20082013 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20082013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2009 Jan 16;206(1):25-34. doi: 10.1084/jem.20082013.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred one consecutive patients were retrospectively evaluated for BM fibrosis and CD34 immunoreactivity. Marrow fibrosis was assessed following the European consensus guidelines. RESULTS: Moderate to severe BM fibrosis was detected in 17% of cases and was associated with multilineage dysplasia (P = .001), high transfusion requirement (P < .001), and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = .007). CD34+ cell clusters were found in 23% of patients and were associated with WHO categories with excess of blasts (P < .001) and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = .001). In multivariable analysis, BM fibrosis and presence of CD34+ cell clusters had independent negative impact on overall survival (P < .001 and P = .019, respectively) and leukemia-free survival (P < .001 and P = .004, respectively). A hierarchical clustering analysis identified three subsets of patients with distinct clinical features. One cluster consisted mainly of patients with BM fibrosis, multilineage dysplasia, and high transfusion requirement; these individuals had lower overall survival and leukemia-free survival (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Within patients stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System and WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System categories, BM fibrosis involved a shift to a one-step more advanced risk group. CONCLUSION: BM fibrosis identifies a distinct subgroup of MDS with multilineage dysplasia, high transfusion requirement, and poor prognosis and represents an independent prognostic factor that may be useful in clinical decision making. Furthermore, the presence of CD34+ cell clusters is an independent risk factor for progression to acute leukemia.","['Della Porta, Matteo Giovanni', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Boveri, Emanuela', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Pietra, Daniela', 'Pascutto, Cristiana', 'Passamonti, Francesco', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Castello, Alessandro', 'Magrini, Umberto', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Della Porta MG', 'Malcovati L', 'Boveri E', 'Travaglino E', 'Pietra D', 'Pascutto C', 'Passamonti F', 'Invernizzi R', 'Castello A', 'Magrini U', 'Lazzarino M', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Pavia Medical School, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/12/24 09:00,2009/02/27 09:00,['2008/12/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.2246 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2246 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 10;27(5):754-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2246.

In this study, we examined whether HTLV-3 or HTLV-4, two newly identified HTLV groups discovered in Central Africa in primate hunters, is involved in LGL leukemia. We developed two specific real-time PCR quantitative assays that are highly sensitive, capable of detecting 10 copies of HTLV-3 or HTLV-4 pol sequences in a background of 1 microg of DNA from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We tested PBL DNA samples from 40 LGL leukemia patients in the United States and found that all samples were negative for HTLV-3 or HTLV-4 infection.

The effects of arsenicals are usually attributed to their ability to bind vicinal thiols or thiol selenols in prefolded proteins thereby compromising cellular function. The present studies suggest an additional, more pleiotropic, contribution to the biological effects of arsenicals. As(III) species, by avid coordination to the cysteine residues of unfolded reduced proteins, can compromise protein folding pathways. Three representative As(III) compounds (arsenite, monomethylarsenous acid (MMA), and an aryl arsenical (PSAO)) have been tested with three reduced secreted proteins (lysozyme, ribonuclease A, and riboflavin binding protein (RfBP)). Using absorbance, fluorescence, and pre-steady-state methods, we show that arsenicals bind tightly to low micromolar concentrations of these unfolded proteins with stoichiometries of 1 As(III) per 2 thiols for MMA and PSAO and 1 As(III) for every 3 thiols with arsenite. Arsenicals, at 10 microM, strongly disrupt the oxidative folding of RfBP even in the presence of 5 mM reduced glutathione, a competing ligand for As(III) species. MMA catalyzes the formation of amyloid-like monodisperse fibrils using reduced RNase. These in vitro data show that As(III) species can slow, or even derail, protein folding pathways. In vivo, the propensity of As(III) species to bind to unfolded cysteine-containing proteins may contribute to oxidative and protein folding stresses that are prominent features of the cellular response to arsenic exposure.","['Ramadan, Danny', 'Rancy, Pumtiwitt C', 'Nagarkar, Radhika P', 'Schneider, Joel P', 'Thorpe, Colin']","['Ramadan D', 'Rancy PC', 'Nagarkar RP', 'Schneider JP', 'Thorpe C']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware 19716, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (riboflavin-binding protein)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Arsenites/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Disulfides/chemistry', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/metabolism', 'Protein Folding/*drug effects', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/isolation & purification/metabolism/ultrastructure']",2008/12/24 09:00,2009/02/13 09:00,['2008/12/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1021/bi801988x [doi]', '10.1021/bi801988x [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2009 Jan 20;48(2):424-32. doi: 10.1021/bi801988x.,10.1021/bi801988x [doi],,"['R01 GM026643-30/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '1-T32-GM08550/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM026643/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008550/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM26643/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2898741,,,,,['NIHMS214044'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: ICC(s) of childhood leukemia trials were audio-taped at six different study sites. The side effects mentioned during each of these ICC(s) were coded and analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred forty cases were reviewed, from which we coded a total of 3,173 acute side effects and 242 late effects. The mean total side effects mentioned during each ICC was 24 (range 5-47). The number of late effects coded were significantly less than acute side effects. We also found that the duration of ICC(s) was positively correlated with the number of side effects mentioned. In addition, the frequency of total side effects mentioned was independent of patient or parent demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that acute side effects are often mentioned but the discussion of late effects is much less frequent in the initial ICC(s). Careful consideration regarding the ratio of acute and late effects that are communicated to parents in the context of the ICC may facilitate parental understanding of clinically relevant side effects.","['Ramirez, Lisa Ysela', 'Huestis, Samantha E', 'Yap, Tsiao Yi', 'Zyzanski, Stephen', 'Drotar, Dennis', 'Kodish, Eric']","['Ramirez LY', 'Huestis SE', 'Yap TY', 'Zyzanski S', 'Drotar D', 'Kodish E']","['Department of Psychology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent/ethics/psychology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Parents/psychology', '*Professional-Family Relations/ethics', 'Truth Disclosure/ethics']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21835 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Apr;52(4):497-502. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21835.,10.1002/pbc.21835 [doi],,"['R01 CA083267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083267-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2643320,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Apr;52(4):437-8.

Even at proximities of 50 m or less, the positive predictive value of having a household measurement over 0.2 microT was only 19.4%. Clearly using distance from power lines, without taking account of other variables such as load, results in a poor proxy of residential magnetic field exposure.

Its use has resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) performed. Although it is expensive, IM induces a complete cytogenetic response in 60-90% of newly diagnosed patients, and up to 10% for those in blastic phase. The standard dose of 400 mg is well tolerated by most patients, although adverse events have been observed, including drug-induced cytopenia.

Applications to different experimental systems demonstrated that this model consistently explains a broad variety of in vivo and in vitro data. A major advantage of the agent-based model (ABM) is the representation of heterogeneity within the hematopoietic stem cell population. However, this advantage comes at the price of time-consuming simulations if the systems become large. One example in this respect is the modeling of disease and treatment dynamics in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where the realistic number of individual cells to be considered exceeds 10(6). To overcome this deficiency, without losing the representation of the inherent heterogeneity of the stem cell population, we here propose to approximate the ABM by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). The major benefit of such an approach is its independence from the size of the system. Although this mean field approach includes a number of simplifying assumptions compared to the ABM, it retains the key structure of the model including the ""age""-structure of stem cells. We show that the PDE model qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the results of the agent-based approach.","['Roeder, Ingo', 'Herberg, Maria', 'Horn, Matthias']","['Roeder I', 'Herberg M', 'Horn M']","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. ingo.roeder@imise.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Stochastic Processes']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/05/14 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11538-008-9373-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2009 Apr;71(3):602-26. doi: 10.1007/s11538-008-9373-7.

On the other hand, a recent cohort study showed that aspirin may increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. To clarify whether aspirin is potentially carcinogenic, we investigated the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is correlated with the incidence of cancer, in cultured cells treated with 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA), a metabolite of aspirin. 2,3-DHBA induced 8-oxodG formation in the PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line. 2,3-DHBA-induced DNA single-strand breaks were also revealed by comet assay using PANC-1 cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed that 2,3-DHBA increased the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PANC-1 cells. The 8-oxodG formation and ROS generation were also observed in the HL-60 leukemia cell line, but not in the hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-resistant clone HP100 cells, suggesting the involvement of H(2)O(2). In addition, an hprt mutation assay supported the mutagenicity of 2,3-DHBA. We investigated the mechanism underlying the 2,3-DHBA-induced DNA damage using (32)P-labeled DNA fragments of human tumor suppressor genes. 2,3-DHBA induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II) and NADH. DNA damage induced by 2,3-DHBA was enhanced by the addition of histone peptide-6 [AKRHRK]. Interestingly, 2,3-DHBA and histone peptide-6 caused base damage in the 5'-ACG-3' and 5'-CCG-3' sequences, hotspots of the p53 gene. Bathocuproine, a Cu(I) chelator, and catalase inhibited the DNA damage. Typical hydroxyl radical scavengers did not inhibit the DNA damage. These results suggest that ROS derived from the reaction of H(2)O(2) with Cu(I) participate in the DNA damage. In conclusion, 2,3-DHBA induces oxidative DNA damage and mutations, which may result in carcinogenesis.","['Oikawa, Shinji', 'Kobayashi, Hatasu', 'Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Isono, Yoshiaki', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Oikawa S', 'Kobayashi H', 'Tada-Oikawa S', 'Isono Y', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Mie 514-8507, Japan. s-oikawa@doc.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydroxybenzoates)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '70D5FBB392 (2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Aspirin/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comet Assay', 'Copper/toxicity', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxybenzoates/metabolism/toxicity', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Models, Biological', 'NAD/pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/04/17 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(08)00306-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 Feb 10;661(1-2):93-100. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.11.016.

The E2A-PBX1 chimeric protein activates expression of several genes, including Wnt16. In the present study, we explored the role of Wnt16 and beta-catenin in t(1;19) B-ALL cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Canonical Wnt signaling was measured by TOPflash activity. Localization of beta-catenin in the cell membrane and its involvement in leukemia-stroma interaction were studied by confocal microscopy. Adhesion to N-cadherin was analyzed by adding (3)H-thymidin-labeled cells to N-cadherin-coated wells. RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, we detected no effects on cell viability or proliferation upon modulation of the Wnt16 levels. Moreover, despite high levels of Wnt16 and beta-catenin, the cells had very low levels of canonical Wnt signaling. Instead, beta-catenin was located in the cell membrane along with N-cadherin. E2A-PBX1-positive leukemia cells adhered strongly to bone marrow stroma cells, and we showed that adherence junctions stained strongly for both proteins. Moreover, knockdown of beta-catenin reduced the adhesion of E2A-PBX1-positive leukemia cells to N-cadherin, suggesting that beta-catenin and N-cadherin play a central role in homotypic cell-to-cell adhesion and in leukemia-stroma adhesion. Interestingly, knockdown of Wnt16 by small interfering RNA reduced the level of N-cadherin. CONCLUSION: Wnt16 does not activate canonical Wnt signaling in E2A-PBX1-positive cells. Instead, beta-catenin is involved in N-cadherin-dependent adherence junctions, suggesting for the first time that leukemia-stroma interactions may be mediated via an N-cadherin-dependent mechanism.","['Nygren, Marit Kveine', 'Dosen-Dahl, Guri', 'Stubberud, Heidi', 'Walchli, Sebastien', 'Munthe, Else', 'Rian, Edith']","['Nygren MK', 'Dosen-Dahl G', 'Stubberud H', 'Walchli S', 'Munthe E', 'Rian E']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (WNT16 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adherens Junctions/genetics/metabolism', 'Cadherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00481-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Feb;37(2):225-33. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.007.

These polymorphisms may effect DNA repair capacity and modulate cancer susceptibility. In this study, we aimed to determine the four polymorphisms in two DNA repair genes, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D (XPD) and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1), in a sample of Turkish patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and evaluate their association with childhood ALL development. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), to analyze XPD Asp312Asn, XPD Lys751Gln, XRCC1 Arg194Trp, and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms in 70 patients with childhood ALL and in 75 disease-free controls, who were of a similar age. No significant differences were observed among the study groups with regard to the XPD codon 312, XPD codon 751, XRCC1 codon 194, and XRCC1 codon 399 polymorphisms. However, the combined XRCC1 Arg194Trp/Trp194Trp variant genotypes were associated with increased risk for ALL in females (OR=5.47; 95% CI=1.49-20.10; p=0.008). This finding indicates that females carrying XRCC1 194Trp allele are at increased risk of developing childhood ALL. These results suggest that the risk of childhood ALL may be associated with DNA repair mechanisms, and understanding these mechanisms will help identify individuals at increased risk of developing childhood ALL, and also should be lead to improved treatment of ALL.","['Batar, Bahadir', 'Guven, Mehmet', 'Baris, Safa', 'Celkan, Tiraje', 'Yildiz, Inci']","['Batar B', 'Guven M', 'Baris S', 'Celkan T', 'Yildiz I']","['Department of Medical Biology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, University of Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey. bahadirbatar@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1)', '0 (XRCC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein)', 'EC 5.99.- (ERCC2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Codon', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein/*genetics']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(08)00493-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Jun;33(6):759-63. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.005.

In both, CSF immunophenotyping analysis identified a majority of T cells (>90%), and less than 10% of B-CLL cells expressing CD5, CD19 and CD20.

METHODS: Two-step serial carbohydrate affinity chromatography was used to isolate a lectin from the edible mushroom clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis). It was characterized biochemically, its gene and cDNA cloned and the deduced amino acid sequence analyzed. Its activity was tested by hemagglutination assay and carbohydrate-binding specificity determined by glycan microarray analysis. Its effect on proliferation of several human cell lines was determined by MTS assay. RESULTS: A homodimeric lectin with 15.9-kDa subunits agglutinates human group A, followed by B, O, and bovine erythrocytes. Hemagglutination was inhibited by glycoprotein asialofetuin and lactose. Glycan microarray analysis revealed that the lectin recognizes human blood group A determinant GalNAcalpha1-3(Fucalpha1-2)Galbeta-containing carbohydrates, and GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc (N,N'-diacetyllactosediamine). The lectin exerts antiproliferative activity specific to human leukemic T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The protein belongs to the ricin B-like lectin superfamily, and has been designated as C. nebularis lectin (CNL). Its antiproliferative effect appears to be elicited by binding to carbohydrate receptors on human leukemic T cells. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: CNL is one of the few mushroom ricin B-like lectins that have been identified and the only one so far shown to possess immunomodulatory properties.","['Pohleven, Jure', 'Obermajer, Natasa', 'Sabotic, Jerica', 'Anzlovar, Sabina', 'Sepcic, Kristina', 'Kos, Janko', 'Kralj, Bogdan', 'Strukelj, Borut', 'Brzin, Joze']","['Pohleven J', 'Obermajer N', 'Sabotic J', 'Anzlovar S', 'Sepcic K', 'Kos J', 'Kralj B', 'Strukelj B', 'Brzin J']","['Department of Biotechnology, Jozef Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia. jure.pohleven@ijs.si']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Lectins)']",IM,"['Agaricales/*chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Lectins/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(08)00262-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009 Mar;1790(3):173-81. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.11.006.

CLP-induced cell apoptosis was reversed by PD98059 (an inhibitor of ERK), but not by SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38) and SP200125 (an inhibitor of JNK), suggesting that the action of CLP on K562 cells was via ERK, but not via p38 and JNK. On the other hand, pretreatment with Bapta-AM, a well-known calcium chelator, partially blocked CLP-induced apoptosis, indicating that the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i may play an important role in the apoptosis. Collectively, in K562 cells, CLP-induced an increase in [Ca(2+)]i which evoked ERK phosphorylation. This ERK phosphorylation subsequently activated Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-3 leading to apoptosis.","['Wang, C L', 'Ng, T B', 'Cao, X H', 'Jiang, Y', 'Liu, Z K', 'Wen, T Y', 'Liu, F']","['Wang CL', 'Ng TB', 'Cao XH', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu ZK', 'Wen TY', 'Liu F']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Life Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (cyclic lipopeptide, Bacillus subtilis)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacterial Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Lipopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(08)00890-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2009 Apr 18;276(2):221-7. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.11.007.

Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations, with their high frequency in AML, were suggested to represent suitable MRD markers, but so far no study has evaluated their usefulness in the posttransplantation period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the validity of this MRD marker in the posttransplantation period in a cohort of 13 patients with an NPM1A mutation (NPM1Amut). For this most frequent NPM1A subtype, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was retrospectively performed on bone marrow/peripheral blood samples that had been taken before and after SCT. RESULTS: NPM1Amut was retrospectively followed up in 13 patients who received 14 transplantations. One-hundred and thirty-nine qPCR analyses were performed (median: 7 time points; median follow-up: 216 days; range, 35-1825 days). After SCT, 10 of 14 NPM1Amut cases (71%) became PCR-negative, of which four achieved stable remissions. All four patients (29%) who remained NPM1Amut-positive after SCT relapsed. In all nine relapse cases, increases of NPM1Amut were seen that preceded morphological relapse and the decrease of molecular chimerism with mean intervals of 24 days (range, 12-38 days) and 15 days (range, 1-36 days), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative assessment of NPM1Amut seems to provide a reliable MRD marker in the posttransplantation period, predicting relapse earlier than morphology or molecular chimerism, which should be confirmed in larger studies.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Badbaran, Anita', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Zander, Axel Rolf', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Bacher U', 'Badbaran A', 'Fehse B', 'Zabelina T', 'Zander AR', 'Kroger N']","['Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hamburg, Germany. u.bacher@uke.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00464-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jan;37(1):135-42. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.014.,10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.014 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tel/PDGFRbeta results in constitutive activation of several signaling pathways and induces a myeloproliferative disease in mice, with signals via tyrosines 579/581 identified as being important for this phenotype. In this study, we have used a tetracycline-regulated system to express wild-type and the mutated F2 Tel/PDGFRbeta to identify the key signaling pathways, which drive Tel/PDGFRbeta-induced differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leukemic oncogene Tel/PDGFRbeta and Tel/PDGFRbeta-F2 were inducibly expressed in ES cells and their effects on self-renewal, signal transduction, and gene expression patterns analyzed. RESULTS: Tel/PDGFRbeta activated several major signal transduction pathways (signal transducers and activators of transcription [STAT] 3, STAT5, mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) in ES cells, but only specific inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) or STAT5 pathways was able to significantly prevent Tel/PDGFRbeta-induced differentiation and restore ES-cell self-renewal. Inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of the oncogene using Gleevec or PDGFRbeta inhibitor III also substantially prevented Tel/PDGFRbeta-induced differentiation and its ability to upregulate key genes involved in myelopoiesis. Tyrosines 579/581 played a critical role in mediating signals via the Ras/ERK and STAT5 pathways, with dual targeting of the tyrosine kinase activity of Tel/PDGFRbeta and the MEK/ERK pathway completely preventing Tel/PDGFRbeta-induced differentiation. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that targeted disruption of key signaling pathways in combination with the tyrosine kinase activity of leukemic oncogenes, such as Tel/PDGFRbeta, may result in more efficacious therapies for suppressing leukemic progression in the clinical setting.","['Dobbin, Edwina', 'Graham, Ciaren', 'Corrigan, Pamela M', 'Thomas, Keith G', 'Freeburn, Robin W', 'Wheadon, Helen']","['Dobbin E', 'Graham C', 'Corrigan PM', 'Thomas KG', 'Freeburn RW', 'Wheadon H']","['Stem Cell and Epigenetics Research Group, Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster, Coleraine, Northern Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00462-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jan;37(1):111-121. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.012.,10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.012 [doi],,['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe three new cases of AML with this abnormality, all adult women (age, 41-66 years). Two cases were acute myelomonocytic leukemia (FAB AML-M4), and one was acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (FAB AML-M2). The deletion was identified at initial diagnosis in one patient and at relapse in the other two. Although all received aggressive therapy, their survival was short. Taken together with the eight previously reported cases, we conclude that deletions in chromosome 15 are associated with AML, both in cases that arise de novo or in the setting of a myeloproliferative disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome. These cases often show features of myelomonocytic or monocytic differentiation.

A recent report of a sole duplication dup(1)(q21q32) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) suggested an inferior prognosis. To further describe structural anomalies involving the 1q21 and 1q32 breakpoints, we present four cases with an inverted dup(1)(q32q21): three in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and one in MDS of the subtype refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts. In all four cases, the aberration presented as the sole anomaly at diagnosis. In one of the ALL cases, relapse during chemotherapy, 5 months from diagnosis, was accompanied by clonal evolution; in another ALL case, early relapse appeared 51 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Structural gains of 1q involving 1q32 and 1q21 breakpoints can occur in different hematological malignancies. The isolated occurrence of the inverted dup(1)(q32q21) may be interpreted as a typical primary alteration in B-lineage ALL paving the way to acquisition of additional abnormalities.

Findings from bone marrow, cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were consistent with the diagnosis of APL. Although PCR products of size 841 bp and 984 bp were amplified from bone marrow specimen, the quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) findings were negative. Given the discrepancy in PCR results, sequencing of PCR products was performed to determine the detailed composition of these fusion transcripts. By cloning and sequencing, we discovered that these two bands were isoforms, in which one exon (exon 5, 144 bp) of the PML gene was spliced out of the smaller products (minor PCR products); one sequence (G) insertion and one base substitution (T-->C) of PML exon 4 generate a stop codon in the smaller fusion transcript. In addition, a search of the Ensembl database revealed that these variant PML/RARA fusion transcripts were composed of exon 7a insertion of the PML gene and partial deletion (46 bp) of exon 3 of the RARA gene, in addition to inserted sequences of intron 7 of PML and genomic sequence ATCT of unknown origin at the fusion junction site. Although the biological significance of most atypical transcripts remains unclear, sequence analysis of these atypical products should be performed, to reveal the composition of such a fusion transcript and elucidate the molecular mechanism.","['Park, Tae Sung', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Song, Jaewoo', 'Lee, Kyung-A', 'Yoon, Seoyoung', 'Suh, Borum', 'Lee, Jong-Han', 'Lee, Hyeon-Ji', 'Kim, Jong-Kee', 'Choi, Jong Rak']","['Park TS', 'Kim JS', 'Song J', 'Lee KA', 'Yoon S', 'Suh B', 'Lee JH', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim JK', 'Choi JR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*Exons', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(08)00523-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Jan 15;188(2):103-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.09.002.,10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.09.002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent abnormality was 13q14.3 deletion, which was detected in 26 (32.9%) patients.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the costs of hospital stay for renal transplantation. This retrospective study included all patients who underwent renal transplantation between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005, in our University hospital. The incurred costs were determined using our center's analytical accounting (AA). The mean local cost was then compared with the median national cost of hospitalization for renal transplantation, based on a sample of participating centers contributing to the National Cost Scale (NCS) per homogenous diagnosis-related group (DRG). These mean costs were weighed against the financing obtained by national rates of the case-mix based payment system (termed T2A). Data were collected from 77 patients. Their mean length of stay was 19.4 days. AA determined the cost of management to be euro14,100 per patient. National economic approaches were significantly higher: euro16,389 for NCS and euro17,369 for national rates. Thus, the specific DRG rate (case mix index) of renal transplantation covers the expenses incurred by our center. These results are rather interesting; however, it is unlike those obtained for the management of other diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia, where T2A underestimates the actual cost by 2-4 times. Last, the hospital budget and T2A must be considered as a whole. The fact that DRGs with favorable and unfavorable pricing balance out should be taken into account.","['Chaumard, N', 'Fagnoni, P', 'Nerich, V', 'Limat, S', 'Dussaucy, A', 'Chalopin, J-M', 'Bittard, H', 'Woronoff-Lemsi, M-C']","['Chaumard N', 'Fagnoni P', 'Nerich V', 'Limat S', 'Dussaucy A', 'Chalopin JM', 'Bittard H', 'Woronoff-Lemsi MC']","['Pharmacy Department, University Hospital of Besancon, Hospital J.

Established methods to study MRD are flow cytometric detection of abnormal immunophenotypes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antigen-receptor genes, and PCR amplification of fusion transcripts. The strong correlation between MRD levels and risk of relapse in childhood ALL is well demonstrated; studies in adult patients also support its prognostic value. Hence, results of MRD studies can be used to select treatment intensity and duration, and to estimate the optimal timing for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Practical issues in the implementation of MRD assays in clinical studies include determining the most informative time point to study MRD and the levels of MRD that will trigger changes in treatment intensity, as well as the relative cost and informative power of different methodologies. The identification of new markers of leukemia and the use of increasingly refined assays should further facilitate routine monitoring of MRD and help to clarify the cellular and biologic features of leukemic cells that resist chemotherapy in vivo.","['Campana, Dario']",['Campana D'],"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. dario.campana@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(08)00143-1 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2009 Jan;46(1):100-6. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.09.001.,10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.09.001 [doi],,"['R01 CA060419-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2632881,,,,67,['NIHMS89417'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the burden of therapy is high in a significant number of newly diagnosed patients, and in all those with relapse. Early response to therapy measured by minimal residual disease evaluation has proven the single most important prognostic factor and is increasingly used in risk stratification. However, as the benefit from intensification of frontline therapy becomes limiting, it becomes increasingly challenging to rescue patients who fail on contemporary risk-adapted protocols. New therapeutic strategies are needed, not only in salvage regimens but also in frontline protocols for patients who are at high risk of relapse.

Even more impressive is the success of targeted therapies in subgroups of ALL. In the formerly most unfavorable subgroup, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)/BCR-ABL-positive ALL, survival now ranges from 40% to 50% after incorporating imatinib in combination chemotherapy. In mature B-ALL, survival rates increased above 80% with the combination of short intensive chemotherapy and rituximab. The prerequisite for comprehensive therapy is standardized and rapid diagnosis and classification as the basis for treatment stratification. Historically, the major aim of original risk stratification was to identify patients with a poor prognosis who would benefit from treatment intensification with SCT; currently stratification has become more complex.

The fact that most anticancer therapy is directed against the bulk of the tumor, and possibly spares the cancer stem cells, may lie at the heart of treatment failures with conventional modalities. Leukemia stem cells are fairly well described for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their existence and relevance for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is less clear. Several reports describe subpopulations with primitive phenotypes in clinical ALL samples. However, it has also been suggested that the majority of leukemic subfractions can propagate leukemia in the appropriate experimental setting, and that their hierarchical organization is less strict than in AML. In addition, it is uncertain whether cancer stem cells arise from malignant transformation of a tissue-specific stem cell, or from committed progenitors or differentiated cells that re-acquire a stem cell-like program. In common childhood ALL, current evidence points towards the cell of origin being a committed lymphoid progenitor.

Studies have shown that there are abundant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor (designated as CD14) molecules on the cell membrane of M5 cells and they play an important role in the diagnosis of M5, since they can be recognized and bound by mouse-anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibody (McAb). However, mouse-originated antibodies are largely not suitable for clinical application due to the severe side effects, thus ""humanized antibody"" is desired. As the first step for developing humanized antibody, the construction and expression of single chain antibody (scFv) with functional protein are necessary. The present study aimed to express ZCH-7-2F9 ScFv (scFv(2F9)) in eukaryotic cells and obtain the scFv(2F9) protein with a high biological activity. METHODS: Four primers were synthesized to construct the eukaryotic expressional vector, which included SfiI and EcoRI enzyme cleaving site, 6 x His and stop code TGA sequences. scFv(2F9) gene was amplified through splicing by overlap extension (SOE) using the high fidelity Taq polymerase. Positive recombinants (pSectag2A/scFv(2F9)) were identified through enzyme cleaving and sequenced before expression and were transformed into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for expression. Western-Blot and flow cytometry (FCM) were carried out to determine the relative molecular mass (Mr) and binding activity of scFv(2F9). RESULTS: The cloned scFv(2F9) gene was identified to be functional by sequencing and expressing. The interested protein could be detected in the culture supernatant of transformed CHO cells with an Mr of 31 000. The blocking test showed that the positive cell percentages, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and the peak of channel (peak Ch) were reduced by 90.02%, 63.30% and 63.38%, respectively after blocking with scFv(2F9), while those were 4.55%, 10.09% and 5.02% after blockage using the supernatant from the CHO cells transfected with blanked vector pSectag2A.

METHODS: All the patients adopted chemotherapy according to therapeutic guideline revised by the Subspecialty Group of Hematology, The Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association for the second-time in 1998 (the Rongcheng ALL-98 Protocol). Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of 188 patients who received therapy with good compliance. The differences of EFS between groups were assessed by Log-rank test. The independent influencing factors on EFS were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: After receiving inductive treatment, 354 of 374 (93.6%) patients demonstrated a complete remission; 188 patients who received complete courses of treatment with good compliance showed (68.1 +/- 5.6)% five-year EFS. Meanwhile, the five-year EFS in standard-risk (SR) group and high-risk (HR) group were (75.2 +/- 6.0)% and (47.6 +/- 11.6)%, respectively. The total relapse rate was 10.6% and the median time to relapse was 13 months. Twenty-nine of 188 patients (15.4%) were dead, and 13 patients (7.0%) died from treatment-related complications. Independent adverse prognostic factors included risk grouping, t (9; 22)/bcr-abl gene and leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: The total EFS of childhood ALL patients treated with Rongcheng ALL-98 Protocol in two hospitals was close to 70%. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate risk factors and consider the grouping in more detail to reduce the treatment-related mortality and to increase the compliance of treatment which can ultimately improve the EFS.","['Yang, Ming-hua', 'Jia, Wen-guang', 'Cao, Li-zhi', 'He, Yu-lei', 'Liao, Ning', 'Chen, Guo-li', 'Luo, Jian-ming', 'Xu, Wang-qiong', 'Yang, Jing']","['Yang MH', 'Jia WG', 'Cao LZ', 'He YL', 'Liao N', 'Chen GL', 'Luo JM', 'Xu WQ', 'Yang J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/12/23 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Jul;46(7):498-501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most toxic moieties conjugated with antibody proteins reported in the literature were toxic proteins which presented immunogenicity to patients capable of inducing anti-toxin antibody. Norcantharidin (NCTD) is a small molecule toxin. It does not have the immunogenicity to human body so that it bears a promising potential for development of new targeting drug. In this study, a new clone of self-made anti-CD19 mAb named ZCH-4-2E8 conjugated with NCTD was used to investigate its targeting efficacy against CD19+ lymphoid malignant Nalm-6 cells in vitro to provide the experimental data for the further development of this new targeting agent. METHODS: A monoclonal antibody named 2E8 was prepared from mouse ascites and purified by gel chromatography. The purity of the antibody protein was checked by SDS-PAGE assay. Immunotoxin 2E8-NCTD was successfully generated through conjugating CD19 mAb protein and Norcantharidin by the activated ester method. The binding activity of the immunoconjugate (2E8-NCTD) against CD19 antigens on cell surface and the expression levels of CD19 antigens on Nalm-6 and K562 cells were examined by flow cytometry. Comparisons of the inhibitory effects among PBS, purified 2E8 antibody, norcantharidin and immunotoxin 2E8-NCTD groups on cell growth of either Nalm-6 cells or K562 cells were made. RESULTS: The purity of the purified 2E8 antibody was higher than 99.00% demonstrated by SDS-PAGE assay. 2E8 antibody in the supernatant reacted with 99.34% of Nalm-6 cells, while only 0.98% of K562 cells reacted with this antibody. The newly generated immunotoxin (2E8-NCTD) had a positive rate of 99.90% on Nalm-6 cells with little reduction of binding activity. From the in vitro study, both 2E8-NCTD and norcantharidin were shown to have significant inhibitory effects on the growth of CD19+ Nalm-6 cells (P < 0.001), while the purified 2E8 antibody did not show any significant influences on the growth of Nalm-6 cells. Since no significant inhibitory effects were identified among immunotoxin 2E8-NCTD, 2E8 antibody and control groups on CD19(-) K562 cells, a significant targeting effect of the 2E8-NCTD against Nalm-6 cells was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The immunotoxin 2E8-NCTD was successfully synthesized by activated ester method with an excellent targeting killing effect on CD19+ Nalm-6 leukemia cells in vitro, which provides some experimental data for the further development of this new targeting agent.","['Li, Li-xia', 'Tang, Yong-min', 'Zhang, Hai-zhong', 'Shen, Hong-qiang', 'Qian, Bai-qin', 'Luo, Chun-fang']","['Li LX', 'Tang YM', 'Zhang HZ', 'Shen HQ', 'Qian BQ', 'Luo CF']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.""]",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '8452E71EO7 (norcantharidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunotoxins/*immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",2008/12/23 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Jul;46(7):493-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed by BIOMED-2 was used to detect TCRbeta gene rearrangements in the bone marrow samples of 26 children with T-ALL. Sequence of junction region were then compared and analyzed in IMGT database. Allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) upstream primers were designed complementary to the V-D-J or D-J junctional region of TCRbeta gene rearrangements. Samples at diagnosis were serially diluted in DNA obtained from mononuclear cells (MNC) from a pool of 20 healthy donors to generate the patient specific standard curves. Subsequently, a TCRbeta RQ-PCR assay to quantify MRD with germline Jbeta primer/probe combinations was applied in six patients. To check the quantity and quality of DNA, the investigators used RQ-PCR analysis for the N-ras gene. RESULTS: Clonal rearrangements were identified in 92.3% childhood T-ALL (Vbeta-Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements in 84.6%, Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements in 50%). Comparative sequence analysis of 42 TCRbeta recombinations revealed two downstream Vbeta families (BV5, BV6) were preferentially used. The segment Jbeta2.7 in childhood T-ALL was preferentially used. Jbeta1.3, Jbeta2.4, and Jbeta2.6 were not found to be used. The slope of the standard curves was from -3.54 to -3.37 and the intercepts were from 19.35 to 20.51. The correlation coefficients of all 6 standard curves were excellent (> or = 0.98). All the RQ-PCR quantitative range reached 10(-4). MRD analysis of follow up samples showed that MRD increased before relapse. CONCLUSION: RQ-PCR analysis of TCRbeta gene rearrangements was highly sensitive and specific, it will be of high value for future T-ALL MRD studies. And quantitative and serial study of MRD may be of prognostic importance.","['Liu, Jie-yu', 'Li, Zhi-gang', 'Gao, Chao', 'Cui, Lei', 'Wu, Min-yuan']","['Liu JY', 'Li ZG', 'Gao C', 'Cui L', 'Wu MY']","[""Hematology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2008/12/23 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Jul;46(7):487-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of HD-AraC for childhood hematological malignancies, and the relationship between the expression of the genes coding the key enzymes for Ara-C metabolism with the outcome of the patients. METHODS: The drug levels of Ara-C in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were detected with HPLC while HD-AraC was used, the expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and cytidine deaminase (CDA) mRNA in human leukemia cell lines and the bone marrow cells were investigated in 48 cases of childhood hematological malignancies with RT-PCR methods, and the relationship between the expression of these enzymes mRNA and the outcome of the patients was analyzed. RESULTS: (1) When HD-AraC was used, the plasma levels of Ara-C and Ara-U could be respectively about 50 times and 25 times higher than those obtained when the patients were treated with regular dose of Ara-C treatment, and the level of Ara-C in cerebrospinal fluid could reach about 10% of plasma level of Ara-C. (2) There were significantly different expressions of dCK mRNA in different childhood acute leukemia (AL) patients, which were markedly related to the chemotherapy results. The expression of dCK in ALL was much higher than that in AML and relapsed AL cases. There were no significant differences in expressions of dCK in T-ALL and B lineage ALL. (3) In vitro study found that the expressions of dCK and CDA mRNA did not change in leukemia cell lines incubated at different doses and times of Ara-C. CONCLUSIONS: HD-AraC was a very effective protocol for childhood hematological malignancies for it could significantly elevate the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid drug levels. The expression of dCK may be an important factor in predicting the long-term outcomes of children with hematological malignancies. Good long-term outcomes of the childhood T-ALL could be achieved as the B lineage ALL had been treated with HD-AraC regimen. As the expression levels of dCK were much lower, it may be necessary for the treatment of AML with HD-AraC for consecutive three days.","['Xie, Xiao-tian', 'Jiang, Sha-yi', 'Li, Ben-shang', 'Yang, Li-li']","['Xie XT', 'Jiang SY', 'Li BS', 'Yang LL']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism']",2008/12/23 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Apr;46(4):276-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-four children and 105 infusions were included in the study. According to 1 h and 6 h plasma MTX concentrations after infusion, based on established high-dose MTX population pharmacokinetics model, the course predicted value of drug concentration at steady state (C(SS)) was calculated. MTX infusion rate and dosage was adjusted 8 h after the start according to the predicted value of C(SS). Then MTX concentration at 23 h (actual value of C(SS)) was measured. RESULTS: To achieve the target range of C(SS), adjustments of MTX dosage were required in 17 (71%) patients. Adjustments of MTX dosage were required in 45 (43%) infusions, the dose was increased in 42 infusions and decreased in 3 infusions. There were 29 infusions of high-dose MTX during consolidation therapy (after remission induction therapy). Among them, 16 infusions had increased dosage, and 1 infusion had decreased dosage. There were 76 infusions during maintenance therapy. Among them, 26 infusions increased dosage, and 2 infusions decreased dosage. Overall 95 (90%) infusions achieved the target range of C(SS), while in 8 infusions the doses were lower than the target range in 2 infusions the doses were higher than the target range. If there had been no adjustments, only 74 (70%) infusions could have achieved the target range. Adjustments of MTX dosage, compared with no adjustments, could remarkably enhance the rate of achieving the target range of C(SS) (chi(2) = 13.366, P = 0.000). Among 60 infusions of no adjustments, the actual values of C(SS) were well correlated with the predicted values of C(SS) (r = 0.487, P = 0.000), and the actual values of C(SS) were also correlated with the 6 h plasma MTX concentrations after infusions (r = 0.389, P = 0.002). The actual values of total clearance (CL) of MTX of 105 infusions were 7.01 +/- 2.06 L/(m(2).h). Inter-courses variability in CL was up to 4.4-fold. Intra-patient variability in CL was up to 2.9-fold. Predisposing factors that correlated with decreased CL of MTX were old age, heavy body weight, low blood phosphate, high blood bilirubin and infusions during maintenance therapy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose methotrexate chemotherapy needed individualized adjustment, as inter-courses variability of CL was up to 4.4-fold among 105 infusions.

METHODS: To detect five types of fusion genes emerging frequently in childhood ALL including TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1, BCR/ABLp190, BCR/ABLp210, MLL/AF4, probes were designed, synthesized and spotted on the chemical-material-coated-glass plates in array. The total RNAs were extracted from patients' bone marrow or peripheral blood cells at the beginning of diagnosis, analyzed by multiplex nested reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and labeled by fluorescein. The products of RT-PCR were hybridized with microarray in order to detect specific types of fusion genes in leukemia cells. RESULTS: Distinctive hybridization signals were obtained for internal positive control and specific types of fusion genes. TEL/AML1 gene was found positive in 2 of the 36 cases, E2A/PBX1 gene in 3, BCR/ABLp190 gene in 2, BCR/ ABLp210 gene in one, and MLL/ AF4 gene in one. The results of the microarray and RT-PCR were consistent. CONCLUSION: The microarray-based assay could screen 5 types of chromosome structural aberrations and the splice variants at the same time. It can provide reliable and helpful information for patient stratification, evaluation of therapeutic effects and prediction of prognosis in childhood ALL, although there are both advantages and disadvantages in applying this new method.","['Wu, Jun', 'Zhang, Le-ping', 'Chen, Su-hong', 'Wang, Sheng-qi']","['Wu J', 'Zhang LP', 'Chen SH', 'Wang SQ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/12/23 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Mar;46(3):198-202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicated that 2149 articles in English and 46 articles in Chinese were got, and finally 9 clinical trials with total 3039 patients have been assessed. No significantly difference was found in engraftment failure and transplant-related mortality resulting from TBI/CY and BU/CY conditioning regimens, but the incidence of veno-occlusion of liver and hemorrhagic cystitis obviously increased in BU/CY group after transplantation, the acute GVHD, interstitial pneumonia and cataract significantly increased in TBI/CY group. The relapse rate of AML in TBI/CY group was lower than that in BU/CY group, and the rate of long-term disease-free survival of AML patients in TBI/CY group also significantly lower than that in BU/CY group, but the relapse rate of CML in TBI/CY group after transplantation was obviously higher than that in BU/CY group, but there was no difference in longterm disease-free survival rate between the two conditioning regimens mentioned above.

Clinical data of 114 ALL patients receiving HSCT, including 70 auto-HSCT and 44 allo-HSCT, were retrospectively analyzed. Disease-free-survival (DFS), relapse-rate (RR) and transplantation-related-mortality (TRM) of patients receiving different HSCT were compared. The results showed that the eight-year OS and DFS in a total of 114 adult ALL patients were (40.89+/-5.27)% and (39.50+/-5.22)% respectively. The three-year DFS of ALL patients who received HSCT in phase CR1 and no CR1 were (47.63+/-5.63)% and (17.65+/-9.25)% (p=0.0034).

The RR of patients received allo-HSCT was lower than that of patients received auto-HSCT, but there was no significant difference between them. The TRM of patients received allo-HSCT was higher than of patients received auto-HSCT (p=0.0313). Expression of myeloid antigen and higher LDH level in diagnosis were poor- prognostic factors. It is concluded that auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT completed in phase CR1 may improve prognosis of the patient with ALL as a method for consolidation chemotherapy, but no significant difference exists between the two HSCTs. Patients receiving allo-HSCT and having I/II aGVHD may achieve higher DFS.

The effect of PUVA on HL-60 cell growth was assayed by MTT method and the changes of ultrastructure of cells were observed by electron microscopy. The apoptosis ratios, changes of mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of Fas and FasL protein and Fas and FasL mRNA were detected by FCM and fluorescent quantitation RT-PCR respectively. The expression of Caspase 8 and Caspase 3 protein were detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC). The results showed that the growth of HL-60 cells were inhibited by PUVA in time-and concentration-dependent manner through inducing cell apoptosis. When the irradiation time of long wave ultraviolet A lasted 15 minutes and the concentration of PSO was 80 microg/ml, the inhibition of HL-60 cell proliferation and apoptosis ratios reached the peak. There were obvious apoptotic ultrastructure changes and decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 cells after treatment with PUVA. The expression of Fas mRAN increased and expression of FasL mRNA decreased after treating with PUVA for 4 hours, and the same results of Fas, FasL expression on protein level were obtained also after treating with PUVA for 24 hours. The expression of caspase 8 and caspase 3 protein enhanced and reached the peak after treating with PUVA for 8 hours. It is concluded that the PUVA can inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells and induce apoptosis of these cells. The possible mechanism is supposed to be up-regulating Fas, down-regulating FasL levels and then activating the levels of caspase 8 and caspase 3. The decreasing of mitochondrial membrane potential may be involved in this process probably.","['Chen, Nan-Nan', 'Huang, Shi-Lin', 'Xiang, Yang', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Zhang, De-Jie', 'Wang, Wei', 'Ma, Muo-Jiao', 'Liu, Xiao-Yu', 'You, Ting-Yu']","['Chen NN', 'Huang SL', 'Xiang Y', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang DJ', 'Wang W', 'Ma MJ', 'Liu XY', 'You TY']","['Department of Chinese Traditional Medicine and Hematology, PLA 210 Hospital, Dalian 116021, Liaoning Province, China. chnngax@163.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'KTZ7ZCN2EX (Ficusin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Ficusin/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2008/12/23 09:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2008)06-1293-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Dec;16(6):1293-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The K562/A02 cells in logarithmic growth phase were used in experiments. The experiments were divided into 4 groups: group control, group adriamycin (A02) alone, group ultrasound (US) alone and group A02+US. The trypan blue dye exclusion test and MTT assay were used to determine the cell viability; Wright's staining was used to detect the apoptosis; the flow cytometry was used to analyze the drug concentration, and the scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the changes of cell surface. The results showed that the significant differences in cell viability, intracellular adriamycin concentration and changes of cell membrane were found between ultrasound-treated and untreated cells in the presence of various concentration of adriamycin. The exposure to ultrasound at 20 kHZ, 0.25 W/cm2 for 60 seconds could obviously decrease LC50 of adriamycin to K562/A02 cells, while the exposure to ultrasound at 20 kHZ, 0.05 W/cm2 for 60 seconds could kill K562/A02 cells at once. After being treated by low frequency ultrasound, the small holes with diameter about 1-2 microm in the cell surface appeared. The ultrasound increased the adriamycin concentration in the cells, accelerated the formation of apoptotic bodies, and promoted apoptosis of adriamycin-resistant cells. It is concluded that the ultrasound at optimal parameters enhances inhibitory effect of adriamycin on drug-resistant cell line, thereby reverses drug-resistance of drug-resistant cell line through sound-hole effect in tumor cells resulting from ultrasound induced cavitation.","['Chen, Bao-An', 'Meng, Qing-Qi', 'Wu, Wei', 'Gao, Feng', 'Shao, Ze-Ye', 'Ding, Jia-Hua', 'Gao, Chong', 'Sun, Xin-Chen', 'Cheng, Hong-Yan', 'Sun, Yun-Yu', 'Wang, Jun', 'Cheng, Jian', 'Zhao, Gang', 'Song, Hui-Hui', 'Bao, Wen', 'Ma, Yan', 'Wang, Xue-Mei']","['Chen BA', 'Meng QQ', 'Wu W', 'Gao F', 'Shao ZY', 'Ding JH', 'Gao C', 'Sun XC', 'Cheng HY', 'Sun YY', 'Wang J', 'Cheng J', 'Zhao G', 'Song HH', 'Bao W', 'Ma Y', 'Wang XM']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu Province, China. cba8888@hotmail.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Ultrasonics']",2008/12/23 09:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2008)06-1283-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Dec;16(6):1283-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression levels of G-CSFR on the A3 cell membrane were detected by flow cytometry. Cell cycle changes of A3 cells treated with different concentrations of G-CSF for 48 hours were examined by propidium iodide staining method. The inhibition and apoptosis rates of A3 cells treated with various combinations of G-CSF, cytarabine (Ara-C), aclarubicin (ACR) were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit and AnnexinV Kit, respectively. The results indicated that the expression level of G-CSFR on A3 cells was 94.2%. The proportion of A3 cells in S-phase rose concomitantly with the increasing of G-CSF concentrations within 0-20 ng/ml. After incubation with Ara-C and G-CSF for 48 hours, A3 cells were inhibited more obviously compared with incubation with Ara-C alone (p<0.05, Ara-C 10(-5) mol/L and 10(-6) mol/L). After incubation with Ara-C, ACR and G-CSF for 48 hours, the apoptotic rate of A3 cells was much more than that after incubation with Ara-C and ACR. It is concluded that the expression level of G-CSFR on A3 cells is high, G-CSF/G-CSFR system has a synergetic effect on eliminating A3 cells when administrated simultaneously with chemical agents. This effect is caused through driving more cells from G0 phase into S phase, increasing sensitivity of A3 cells to chemical drugs and inducing cell apoptosis which may be one of the mechanisms of CAG regimen eliminating A3 cells.","['Wu, Yan-Ling', 'Xue, Sheng-Li', 'Sun, Ai-Ning', 'Dai, Lan', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Wu YL', 'Xue SL', 'Sun AN', 'Dai L', 'Wu DP']","['The First Hospital, Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Key Laboratory of Thrombosis & Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'CAG protocol']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology']",2008/12/23 09:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2008)06-1279-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Dec;16(6):1279-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is concluded that chromosome 13 deletion may be involved in initiation of a subset of PCL, and the region of loss at chromosome 13 locates between 13q14 and 13q31 in PCL. FISH is a more rapid, exact and sensitive technique in analysis of chromosome 13 deletion in PCL.","['Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Fan, Lei', 'Chen, Li-Juan', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Wang, Rong', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Lu, Hua']","['Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Fan L', 'Chen LJ', 'Qiu HR', 'Wang R', 'Qiao C', 'Lu H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sequence Deletion']",2008/12/23 09:00,2011/07/09 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2008)06-1261-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Dec;16(6):1261-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the association of herpes viruses with hematopoietic malignancies is attracting researchers' attention. With the extensive development of hematopoietic stem cell and organ transplantation, reports regarding transplantation failure and complication caused by infection of human herpes virus has been increasing. Cytokine storm was firstly suggested as the mechanism of graft-versus-host diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alkylator-based chemotherapy is recognized to be leukemogenic; however, it is infrequently described as a delayed consequence of anti-glioma treatment. METHODS: Seven patients (4 men; 3 women) ages 34-69 years (median 44), with gliomas (3 Grade 2; 4 Grade 3) were treated with surgery, all but one with involved-field radiotherapy and all with alkylator-based chemotherapy (temozolomide; 6 patients, nitrosoureas; 5 patients, both agents; 5 patients). RESULTS: Exposure to alkylator-based chemotherapy ranged from 8 to 30 months (median 24). The diagnosis of tMDS was determined by bone marrow biopsy in 7 patients. Seven patients showed chromosomal abnormalities consistent with chemotherapy induced MDS. Three patients were diagnosed with AML as well (in two determined by bone marrow and one at autopsy). Interval from last chemotherapy exposure to diagnosis of tMDS/AML ranged from 3 to 31 months (median 24 months). Two patients were treated with bone marrow transplantation and 5 received supportive care only. Five patients have died, 2 as a consequence of recurrent brain tumor, 1 as a complication of transplantation, and 2 due to AML. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, induction of tMDS/AML following extended use of alkylator-based chemotherapy may become more relevant with the evolving practice to treat gliomas for protracted periods. Future work to determine at risk patients would be important.","['Chamberlain, Marc C', 'Raizer, Jeffrey']","['Chamberlain MC', 'Raizer J']","['Department of Neurology and Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, DC, USA. chambemc@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glioma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Reoperation/statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors', 'Temozolomide', 'Time Factors']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-008-9764-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2009 Jun;93(2):229-32. doi: 10.1007/s11060-008-9764-5.

Abnormalities in a variety of cell intrinsic and extrinsic molecular mechanisms cooperatively promote tumor formation. Therapeutic approaches that specifically target components of these molecular mechanisms are getting widespread attention. Mcl-1 is a highly expressed pro-survival protein in human malignancies and its cellular expression is tightly regulated via multiple mechanisms. Mcl-1 differs from other members of the Bcl-2 family in having a very short half-life. So inhibition of its expression and/or neutralization of its anti-apoptotic function will rapidly make Mcl-1-dependent cells more susceptible to apoptosis and provide an opportunity to combat several types of cancers. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the regulation of Mcl-1 expression and discusses the alternative approaches targeting Mcl-1 in human cancer cells whose survivals mainly depend on Mcl-1.,"['Akgul, C']",['Akgul C'],"['Department of Chemistry, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Turkey. cahitakgul@comu.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/*genetics']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-008-8637-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2009 Apr;66(8):1326-36. doi: 10.1007/s00018-008-8637-6.,10.1007/s00018-008-8637-6 [doi],,,,,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limited antileukemic cytotoxicity and severe gastrointestinal toxicity have restricted the clinical application of these targeted drugs. Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor autoupregulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of the gene encoding BCL-2-like apoptosis initiator-11 (BCL2L11). GSI treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and accumulation of goblet cells in the gut mediated by upregulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor-4 (Klf4), a negative regulator of the cell cycle required for goblet cell differentiation. In contrast, glucocorticoid treatment induced transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) and protected mice from developing the intestinal goblet cell metaplasia typically induced by inhibition of NOTCH signaling with GSIs. These results support a role for glucocorticoids plus GSIs in the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL.","['Real, Pedro J', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Palomero, Teresa', 'Castillo, Mireia', 'Hernando, Eva', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Barnes, Kelly', 'Sawai, Catherine', 'Homminga, Irene', 'Meijerink, Jules', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Ai, Walden', 'Ferrando, Adolfo']","['Real PJ', 'Tosello V', 'Palomero T', 'Castillo M', 'Hernando E', 'de Stanchina E', 'Sulis ML', 'Barnes K', 'Sawai C', 'Homminga I', 'Meijerink J', 'Aifantis I', 'Basso G', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Ai W', 'Ferrando A']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NR3C1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Homeostasis/drug effects/physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/metabolism/physiology']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]']","['nm.1900 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.1900 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2009 Jan;15(1):50-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.1900.

The patient developed no adverse events other than fever and stomatitis during the 2 transplantation courses. Fifty-six months after the transplantations, she remains in complete remission with continuous oral administration of bisphosphonate alone. Taken together, although primary plasma cell leukemia is a rare hematologic malignancy with poor prognosis, the intensive chemotherapy followed by tandem autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may well improve the clinical outcome.","['Iino, Masaki', 'Nakajima, Atsuko', 'Shindo, Hiroo']","['Iino M', 'Nakajima A', 'Shindo H']","['Dept. of Medical Oncology, Yamanashi Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

This is probably due to lack of experimental models for evaluating the impacts of stress through an ovarian-independent pathway. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible impact of stress on uterine receptivity, independent of HPG axis dysfunction, using a mouse implantation model maintained with hormone supplementation. METHODS: Blastocysts from donor mice were transferred into the uterine lumen of ovariectomized (OVX) Balb/c female recipient mice following supplementation with estradiol and progesterone. The recipients were divided into two groups: those exposed (stress group) or not exposed (control group) to intermittent sonic exposure prior to embryo transfer (ET). The number of implantation sites (IS) was compared between these groups. Microarray analysis was performed to elucidate stress-induced molecular alterations in uteri during the implantation period. Sequential gene expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), an estradiol-inducible gene, was also analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: A non-mating OVX model with satisfactory implantation rates was established. The number of IS in the stress group (n = 20) was significantly less than that in the control group (n = 18) (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.0375). Implantation-related genes and ovarian-hormone-responsive genes were repressed in the stress group despite ovarian hormone supplementation. The expression of Lif was suppressed in the stress group. CONCLUSIONS: Stress can cause decreased uterine receptivity through an ovarian-independent pathway.","['Kondoh, Eiji', 'Okamoto, Takako', 'Higuchi, Toshihiro', 'Tatsumi, Keiji', 'Baba, Tsukasa', 'Murphy, Susan K', 'Takakura, Kenji', 'Konishi, Ikuo', 'Fujii, Shingo']","['Kondoh E', 'Okamoto T', 'Higuchi T', 'Tatsumi K', 'Baba T', 'Murphy SK', 'Takakura K', 'Konishi I', 'Fujii S']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Embryo Implantation', '*Embryo Transfer', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility/physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Models, Animal', 'Noise/adverse effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovariectomy', 'Ovary/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/administration & dosage', '*Stress, Physiological', 'Uterus/*physiology']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']","['den461 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/den461 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2009 Apr;24(4):945-53. doi: 10.1093/humrep/den461.

We tested the combinatorial apoptotic strategy of using bortezomib together with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), both in monolayers and in spheroids of A549 lung cancer cells. Indeed, bortezomib plus TRAIL induced synergistic apoptosis in A549 cells grown as monolayers, but had little effect on A549 cells grown as three-dimensional multicellular spheroids. The acquired resistance of spheroids was not due to a limitation of diffusion, to survival pathways, such as NF-kappaB or PI3K/Akt/mTOR, or to the up-regulation of FLIP(S) (Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein, short). We then investigated a role for the Bcl-2 family of anti- and proapoptotic proteins. When cells formed spheroids, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 increased, whereas antiapoptotic Mcl-1 decreased. ABT-737, a small molecule that inhibits Bcl-2, but not Mcl-1, abolished the multicellular resistance of A549 spheroids to bortezomib plus TRAIL. In another lung cancer cell line, H1299, acquisition of multicellular resistance in spheroids was also accompanied by an increase in Bcl-2 and decrease in Mcl-1. In H1299 spheroids compared with those of A549, however, Mcl-1 remained higher, and Mcl-1 knockdown was more effective than ABT-737 in removing multicellular resistance. Our study suggests that the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins contributes to the acquired multicellular resistance of spheroids, and suggests a possible target for improving the response of lung cancer to bortezomib therapies.","['Yang, Tsung-Ming', 'Barbone, Dario', 'Fennell, Dean A', 'Broaddus, V Courtney']","['Yang TM', 'Barbone D', 'Fennell DA', 'Broaddus VC']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diffusion', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Time Factors']",2008/12/23 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2008/12/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['2008-0320OC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2008-0320OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2009 Jul;41(1):14-23. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2008-0320OC.

Donor T cells play a major role in GVHD leading to the host tissue damage, mainly the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. A selective depletion using an anti-CD25 immunotoxin can eliminate harmful alloreactive T cells while preserving other donor T cells with antileukemic and antiinfectious reactivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed 15 mixed lymphocyte reactions with clinical specimens from 12 patients with various types of leukemia (7x AML, 3x ALL, 1x CML, 1x CLL) and PBMC from 15 healthy volunteers from Transfusive station FN Brno Bohunice. RESULTS: In our experiments we have demonstrated, that antileukemic (GVL) effect of donor, especially CD4+ T cells was well preserved (7.46%), while unfavourable alloreactive (GVH) reaction of donor T cells was completely removed. The graft-versus-host (GVH) reactivation of donor cells was negligible ever after repeated stimulation with irradiated patient's PBMC. CONCLUSION: We have shown that anti-CD25 immunotoxin (IT), RFT5-SMPT-dgA, launched against alpha chain for human interleukin 2 (IL-2), led to long-term selective depletion of alloreactive donor T cell clones while their antileukemic activity was well preserved.

The aim was to see to what extent echo guided pericardiocentesis could contribute in severe cases. METHODS: All patients with abundant pericardial effusion diagnosed by echocardiography with or without compression were considered in a prospective study. They experienced a pericardiocentesis. Some patients did undergo an additional surgical biopsy. The liquid was preliminarily submitted to chemical, bacteriological, cytological analysis. Tissues were observed through an anatomic pathology in biopsy. Heart tuberculosis was diagnosed through histology for following therapeutic testing. RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients aged 37 in average were included. The sex ratio was 3.75. Prior to draining off, 3 neoplasies (2 of lung bronchitis, 1 of cervix ), 1 leukaemia, 2 extra pericardium tuberculosis and 1 amoebic abscess were diagnosed . Clinical occurrence: the most frequent case, besides the tampon (10 cases, i.e. 30%), was isolated pericardial effusion associated or not with an alteration of the global state (13 cases, i.e. 4%). The average quantity of liquid extracted was 600c c which provoked a kind of haemorrhage in 18 cases, i.e. 60%.

A range of CVC devices may be used, and risks for the development of complications are not uniform. The objectives of this study were to determine the natural history and rate of CVC-related complications and risk factors for CR-BSI and to compare device-specific complications in a hematology population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational cohort of patients with hematologic malignancy was prospectively studied following CVC insertion. Participants were reviewed until a CVC-related complication necessitated device removal, completion of therapy, death, or defined end-of-study date. The National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance definition for CR-BSI was used. Overall and device-specific rates of infective and noninfective complications were calculated and potential risk factors were captured. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred six CVCs (75 peripherally inserted central venous catheters [PICCs], 31 nontunneled CVCs) were evaluated in 66 patients, over 2,399 CVC days. Thrombosis occurred in 16 cases (15.1%), exit-site infection in two (1.9%), and CR-BSI in 18 (7.5 per 1,000 CVC days). No significant differences were found when complication rates in PICC and nontunneled devices were compared. An underlying diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was negatively associated with CR-BSI (odds ratio (OR) 0.14, p = 0.046), and a previous diagnosis of fungal infection was associated with infection (OR 22.82, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: CR-BSI rates in our hematology population are comparable to prior reports. A low rate of exit-site infection and high proportion of thrombotic complications were observed. No significant differences in thrombotic or infective complications were evident when PICC and nontunneled devices were compared. PICC devices are a practical and safe option for management of hematology patients.","['Worth, Leon J', 'Seymour, John F', 'Slavin, Monica A']","['Worth LJ', 'Seymour JF', 'Slavin MA']","['Centre for Clinical Research Excellence in Infectious Disease, Victorian Infectious Diseases Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia. leon.worth@petermac.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Catheter-Related Infections/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/instrumentation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Device Removal', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-008-0561-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2009 Jul;17(7):811-8. doi: 10.1007/s00520-008-0561-7.

However, the incidence of recurrent CSDH varies from 3.7 to 30% after surgery. The authors attempted to elucidate the risk factors associated with the recurrence of CSDH in one burr hole drainage technique. METHODS: A total of 255 consecutive cases who underwent one burr hole drainage for CSDH were included in this study. Twenty-four patients (9.4%) underwent a repeated operation because of the recurrence of CSDH. We analyzed retrospectively the demographic, clinical and radiologic factors associated with the recurrence of CSDH. RESULTS: In this study, two risk factors were found to be independently associated with the recurrence of CSDH. The incidence of CSDH recurrence in the high- and mixed-density groups was significantly higher than those in the low- and iso-density groups (p<0.001). Bleeding tendency such as in leukemia, liver disease and chronic renal failure was also significantly associated with recurrence of CSDH (p=0.037). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that high- and mixed- density shown on computed tomographic scan was closely relates with a high incidence of recurrence. Therefore, the operation could be delayed in those cases unless severe symptoms or signs are present. Reoperation using the previous burr hole site is a preferred modality to treat the recurrent CSDH.","['Ko, Byung-Soo', 'Lee, Jung-Kil', 'Seo, Bo-Ra', 'Moon, Sung-Jun', 'Kim, Jae-Hyoo', 'Kim, Soo-Han']","['Ko BS', 'Lee JK', 'Seo BR', 'Moon SJ', 'Kim JH', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Chonnam National University Hospital & Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Korean Neurosurg Soc,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,101467054,,,,2008/12/20 09:00,2008/12/20 09:01,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/20 09:01 [medline]']",['10.3340/jkns.2008.43.1.11 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Neurosurg Soc. 2008 Jan;43(1):11-5. doi: 10.3340/jkns.2008.43.1.11.

We have previously shown that CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs can be identified using stem cell-associated cell surface markers, including C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1), and lineage markers, such as CD7, CD19, and CD56. A similar study was performed for AML SP to further characterize the SP cells with the aim of narrowing down the putatively very low stem cell fraction. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of 48 bone marrow and peripheral blood samples at diagnosis showed SP cells in 41 of 48 cases that were partly or completely positive for the markers, including CD123. SP cells in normal bone marrow (NBM) were completely negative for markers, except CD123. Further analysis revealed that the SP fraction contains different subpopulations: (a) three small lymphoid subpopulations (with T-, B-, or natural killer-cell markers); (b) a differentiated myeloid population with high forward scatter (FSC(high)) and high sideward scatter (SSC(high)), high CD38 expression, and usually with aberrant marker expression; (c) a more primitive FSC(low)/SSC(low), CD38(low), marker-negative myeloid fraction; and (d) a more primitive FSC(low)/SSC(low), CD38(low), marker-positive myeloid fraction. NBM contained the first three populations, although the aberrant markers were absent in the second population. Suspension culture assay showed that FSC(low)/SSC(low) SP cells were highly enriched for primitive cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses showed that cytogenetically abnormal colonies originated from sorted marker positive cells, whereas the cytogenetically normal colonies originated from sorted marker-negative cells. In conclusion, AML SP cells could be discriminated from normal SP cells at diagnosis on the basis of expression of CLL-1 and lineage markers. This reveals the presence of a low-frequency (median, 0.0016%) SP subfraction as a likely candidate to be enriched for leukemia stem cells.","['Moshaver, Bijan', 'van Rhenen, Anna', 'Kelder, Angele', 'van der Pol, Marjolein', 'Terwijn, Monique', 'Bachas, Costa', 'Westra, August H', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan']","['Moshaver B', 'van Rhenen A', 'Kelder A', 'van der Pol M', 'Terwijn M', 'Bachas C', 'Westra AH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Zweegman S', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['26/12/3059 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2007-0861 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 Dec;26(12):3059-67. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2007-0861.,10.1634/stemcells.2007-0861 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that deacetylase inhibition led to the E2F1- and myc-mediated transcriptional activation of the microRNA miR106b in primary CLL cells. Induction of miR106b was associated with a down-regulation in the levels of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Itch. Decreases in Itch protein levels were associated with a reciprocal accumulation of its proapoptotic substrate, TAp73 (p73), and induction of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) mRNA and protein. This event was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, processing of caspase-9, and apoptosis of CLL cells. Ectopic expression of miR106b in CLL cells demonstrated that Itch was a direct target of miR106b such that miR106b-induced decreases in Itch resulted in an accumulation of p73. Thus, our results identify a novel regulatory mechanism wherein microRNA regulate cell survival by mediating the posttranscriptional down-regulation of an ubiquitin ligase, leading to the induction of a proapoptotic regulator in malignant cells. Silencing of miRNA expression in CLL may selectively suppress proapoptotic pathways, providing such tumors with a survival advantage. Consequently, chemotherapeutic drugs that activate miR106b could initiate a p53-independent mechanism that targets CLL cells.","['Sampath, Deepa', 'Calin, George A', 'Puduvalli, Vinay K', 'Gopisetty, Gopal', 'Taccioli, Cristian', 'Liu, Chang-Gong', 'Ewald, Brett', 'Liu, Chaomei', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Plunkett, William']","['Sampath D', 'Calin GA', 'Puduvalli VK', 'Gopisetty G', 'Taccioli C', 'Liu CG', 'Ewald B', 'Liu C', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

To address whether ND-10 localization of L2 occurs in natural cervical lesions, we used a HPV16 and HPV18 L2-specific monoclonal antibody (RG-1), in addition to rabbit antiserum to HPV6 L2, to localize L2. Immunohistochemical staining with RG-1 produced diffuse staining in the nuclei of some cells located within the superficial epithelial layers in eight of nine cases of HPV16/18(+) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1); however, no staining was observed in HPV16/18(+) high-grade CIN (0 of 8 cases), normal cervical epithelium (0 of 20 cases), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (0 of 102 cases), adenocarcinoma (0 of 51 cases), or adenosquamous carcinoma (0 of 6 cases).

Applying dynamic in vivo imaging to a mouse model, we show that leukemic cell growth disrupts normal hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) bone marrow niches and creates abnormal microenvironments that sequester transplanted human CD34+ (HPC-enriched) cells. CD34+ cells in leukemic mice declined in number over time and failed to mobilize into the peripheral circulation in response to cytokine stimulation. Neutralization of stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by leukemic cells inhibited CD34+ cell migration into malignant niches, normalized CD34+ cell numbers, and restored CD34+ cell mobilization in leukemic mice. These data suggest that the tumor microenvironment causes HPC dysfunction by usurping normal HPC niches and that therapeutic inhibition of HPC interaction with tumor niches may help maintain normal progenitor cell function in the setting of malignancy.","['Colmone, Angela', 'Amorim, Maria', 'Pontier, Andrea L', 'Wang, Sheng', 'Jablonski, Elizabeth', 'Sipkins, Dorothy A']","['Colmone A', 'Amorim M', 'Pontier AL', 'Wang S', 'Jablonski E', 'Sipkins DA']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, 5841 South Maryland Avenue MC 2115, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]']","['322/5909/1861 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1164390 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2008 Dec 19;322(5909):1861-5. doi: 10.1126/science.1164390.,10.1126/science.1164390 [doi],,"['1DP2OD002160-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', '5K08CA112126-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show tumor-specific methylation of the PTPRO CpG island in primary human breast cancer. PTPRO expression was significantly reduced in established breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 due to promoter methylation compared with its expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells (48R and 184). Further, the silenced gene could be demethylated and reactivated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon treatment with 5-Azacytidine, a DNA hypomethylating agent. Because PTPRO promoter harbors estrogen-responsive elements and 17beta-estradiol (E2) plays a role in breast carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of E2 and its antagonist tamoxifen on PTPRO expression in human mammary epithelial cells and PTPRO-expressing breast cancer cell line Hs578t. Treatment with E2 significantly curtailed PTPRO expression in 48R and Hs578t cells, which was facilitated by ectopic expression of estrogen receptor (ER)beta but not ERalpha. On the contrary, treatment with tamoxifen increased PTPRO expression. Further, knockdown of ERbeta by small interfering RNA abolished these effects of E2 and tamoxifen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed association of c-Fos and c-Jun with PTPRO promoter in untreated cells, which was augmented by tamoxifen-mediated recruitment of ERbeta to the promoter. Estradiol treatment resulted in dissociation of c-Fos and c-Jun from the promoter. Ectopic expression of PTPRO in the nonexpressing MCF-7 cells sensitized them to growth-suppressive effects of tamoxifen. These data suggest that estrogen-mediated suppression of PTPRO is probably one of the early events in estrogen-induced tumorigenesis and that expression of PTPRO could facilitate endocrine therapy of breast cancer.","['Ramaswamy, Bhuvaneswari', 'Majumder, Sarmila', 'Roy, Satavisha', 'Ghoshal, Kalpana', 'Kutay, Huban', 'Datta, Jharna', 'Younes, Mamoun', 'Shapiro, Charles L', 'Motiwala, Tasneem', 'Jacob, Samson T']","['Ramaswamy B', 'Majumder S', 'Roy S', 'Ghoshal K', 'Kutay H', 'Datta J', 'Younes M', 'Shapiro CL', 'Motiwala T', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRO protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', '*Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3', '*Tamoxifen/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]']","['me.2008-0211 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2008-0211 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2009 Feb;23(2):176-87. doi: 10.1210/me.2008-0211.

However, previous studies have not specifically examined how well a typical MCL immunophenotype distinguishes MCL from CLL. We identified 28 cases of SBCN with typical flow cytometry-determined MCL immunophenotypes consisting mostly of peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that 57% (16/28) had t(11;14) translocations consistent with MCL, while 32% (9/28) lacked t(11;14) translocations but harbored other cytogenetic abnormalities commonly found in CLL. There were no significant morphologic or immunophenotypic differences between the t(11;14)-positive and t(11;14)-negative cases.

A multidrug resistant K562/ADM cell line and drug-sensitive K562 cell line was used. The intracellular concentration of daunorubicin and the accumulation of Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) in the K562/ADM and K562 cells were evaluated. Clinical effects of CsA were also studied in 65 patients with AML. In the K562/ADM cells, the 50% of inhibition concentration (IC50) of daunorubicin only group was 23.0+/-5.2 micromol/L, which was greater than in other groups co-administered with CsA (1.2+/-4.8 micromol/L), verapamil (1.5+/-5.4 micromol/L) or CsA+verapamil (1.4+/-4.3 micromol/L) (all P<0.01). The relative fluorescence intensity of Rh123 in the K562/ADM cells treated with CsA and daunorubicin was increased from 48.9% to 69.8% (P<0.05). CsA also improved the complete remission rate in the AML patients (72.7% vs 21.9%, P<0.01). We conclude that CsA can significantly diminish the multidrug resistance in K562/ADM cells.

However, their use in the field of hematology has not been tested. OBJECTIVES: We undertook a study to pre-test seven case vignettes, and thereby to assess practice patterns and, when possible, guideline adherence in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by French hematologists. FINDINGS: Of the 64 hematologists who agreed to participate, 26 (41%) completed the vignettes. We found significant differences in the physicians' patterns of ordering further investigations among young and old patients in the same clinical context. This is not consistent with published guidelines. Moreover, the most striking differences concerned the physicians' interpretations of prognostic factors and the use of radiological testing before treatment. Modalities of treatment were variable across clinical situations, especially with regard to second-line treatments. Clinicians understood the vignettes well, except for those that dealt with stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed the feasibility of the use of case vignettes to assess the quality of clinical practice in CLL. The initial results identified deviations from the published guidelines. A large-scale European survey will commence in a few months.","['Camps, Sandra M', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Levy, Vincent']","['Camps SM', 'Chevret S', 'Levy V']","[""INSERM 9504, Centre d'Investigations Cliniques, Hopital Saint Louis, AP-HP, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematology/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(08)00499-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Oct;33(10):1328-34. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.11.008.

Pro- and anti-apoptotic members of this family function through a complex network of homo- and hetero-dimers to determine whether a cell lives or dies. Members of the Bcl-2 family are classically recognized for their role in apoptosis, yet emerging evidence has highlighted their importance in the regulation of cell cycle. Cellular proliferation, differentiation and death accompany early placental development of the trophoblast lineage. We have recently reported on the expression and function of two Bcl-2 family members in normal placental development, namely the pro-apoptotic Mtd/Bok, and its anti-apoptotic partner Mcl-1 and have found that their expression is upregulated by low oxygen, a key mediator of trophoblast cell proliferation in early placentation. Interestingly, we have also reported that the expression of the Mtd/Mcl-1 system is altered in preeclampsia, a placental pathology associated with a status of oxidative stress and typically characterized by an immature proliferative trophoblast phenotype and excessive trophoblast cell death. In this pathology levels of pro-apototic Mtd-L and Mtd-P are increased and anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 is cleaved in to a pro-apoptotic isoform. Disruption in Mtd/Mcl-1 expression seen in preeclampsia may contribute to both the increased apoptosis and hyperproliferative nature of this disorder.","['Ray, J', 'Jurisicova, A', 'Caniggia, I']","['Ray J', 'Jurisicova A', 'Caniggia I']","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. ray@lunenfeld.ca']",['eng'],"['Lecture', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Placenta,Placenta,8006349,"['0 (BOK protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Awards and Prizes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Placentation/*physiology', 'Pre-Eclampsia/physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Trophoblasts/*metabolism']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0143-4004(08)00378-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.placenta.2008.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Placenta. 2009 Mar;30 Suppl A:S96-100. doi: 10.1016/j.placenta.2008.11.008.

Ara-C reportedly competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA during synthesis and exhibits various cytogenotoxic effects. In the present study, single intraperitoneal treatment of three different doses of Ara-C, 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg b.w. of mice, selected in accordance with its human therapeutic dose, induced statistically significant (p < or = 0.01) and dose dependent increase in the percentages of aberrant metaphases and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) at 24h post-treatment, and micronuclei (MN) in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) at 30 h post-treatment. However, there was no significant change in the mitotic index (MI) at 24h post-treatment, when compared to that of the control mice. In the male germline, all the three doses of Ara-C induced statistically significant (p < or = 0.05 or p < or = 0.01) and dose dependent increase in the percentages of aberrant spermatogonial metaphases and CAs at 24h post-treatment and statistically significant (p < or = 0.01) and dose dependent increase in the percentages of aberrant primary spermatocytes at week 4 post-treatment. However, the induction of abnormal sperm at week 8 post-treatment was decreased, although significantly. The results indicated that Ara-C was clastogenic to both bone marrow and spermatogonial cells of mice, and some of its cytogenotoxic effects were found transmitted through the male germline, at least up to the formation of primary spermatocytes. As the drug is not target specific, the induced cytogenotoxic effects of Ara-C on non-cancerous cells of cancer patients retain possible risk of recurrence of second malignancy among the post-chemotherapeutic cancer survivors. In addition, there is every risk of transmission of some induced genetic alterations to the next generation through the gametes of the cancer survivors pre-treated with this drug. Therefore, Ara-C essentially be made target specific.","['Palo, Anil K', 'Sahoo, Diptirani', 'Choudhury, Ramesh C']","['Palo AK', 'Sahoo D', 'Choudhury RC']","['Department of Zoology, Berhampur University, Berhampur 760 007, Orissa, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Germ Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/*drug effects']",2008/12/20 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(08)00355-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 Feb 19;673(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.11.007.

METHODS: The methods and the curative effect of 32 patients with laparoscopic splenectomy performed by the way as mentioned above were summarized and analyzed. 4 males, 28 females, median 36 years (range 16 - 64 years). Mean dimensions of spleens were 17 cm (range 11 - 23 cm). Nineteen patients had idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), 6 hereditary spherocytosis (HS) (5 of them were the same family constellation), 3 hemolytic anemia (HA), 2 spleen injury with haematoma infection, 1 Evan syndrome, 1 leukemia. Peri-splenic ligaments were resected by LigaSure combined with ultrasound scalpel, splenic pedicle was resected by spleen sub-pedicle two steps severance with LigaSure when splenic pedicle were sufficiently free. Splenic pedicle was non-excisional occluded by LigaSure at pancreatic cauda, in the first step and was occluded and resected alongside of the spleen in the second step. RESULTS: All of the 32 cases were completely succeed, the average operating time was 70 min (55 - 130 min), the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 200 ml (50 - 600 ml), no complications such as abdominal haemorrhage, visceral injury, pancreatic leakage and infection were observed.

METHODS: The clonal rearrangements and mutational status of IgVH genes were analyzed in Hodgkin variant of Richter syndrome and B-CLL with Reed-Stemberg (R-S)-like cells by GeneScan analysis and sequencing. Semi-nest PCR based on laser capture microdissection was utilized to compare the clonal relationship between B-CLL and R-S/R-Slike cells. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the different expressions of ZAP70, p53, IRF-4 and LMP1 in the two components. RESULTS: (1) 5/6 B-CLL cases transformed to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)/R-S-like cells carried the mutated IgVH genes; (2) 2 cases of R-S cells and 1 case of R-S-like cells were clonally distinct from B-CLL clone and express LMP1, whereas 1 case of R-S-like cells was relating to the surrounding B-CLL cells and did not express LMP1; (3) 2/6 B-CLL cases transformed to HL convey VH4-34 and VH3-48 respectively.

It can appear spontaneously or as a result of the pathergy phenomenon after trauma or surgery. METHODS: We review three patients with postoperative PG (PPG) and the relevant literature. We also report an accurate method for microbial detection by 16S ribosomal (r)RNA sequencing. RESULTS: A 47-year-old woman and two men aged 54 and 48 years, respectively, presented with sterile ulcerations after surgery. Associated conditions (Crohn's disease and leukaemia) were present. Surgical wound infection was suspected and systemic empirical antibiotics were prescribed. After infection was excluded, PPG was diagnosed and corticosteroids were started. DISCUSSION: PPG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of postsurgical wound complications.

A 71-year-old man was admitted to the St. Marianna University Hospital because of fever and generalized lymphadenopathy. Right axillary lymph node biopsy revealed mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma (MCHL). The patient was referred to the Tokyo Medical Center, where he was treated with chemotherapy and obtained CR. One year later, the patient again developed fever and generalized lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the right cervical mass revealed a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was treated with salvage chemotherapies and obtained the second CR. Two years later, the patient developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although CR was achieved with chemotherapy, AML relapsed 5 months later and proved to be refractory. Two and a half years later, the patient developed right cervical lymph node enlargement. The biopsy again revealed diagnosis of MCHL. The patient died 2 months later. On reviewing all of the biopsy specimens, including the findings of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, possibility of CHL was ruled out, because neoplastic giant cells resembling Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells were positive for both Oct2 and BOB.1, which has not been reported in CHL. Both HRS-like cells at the time of diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma and lymphoma cells at the time of diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma were positive for CD20 and EBV-encoded small RNAs. This case was finally diagnosed as having age-related EBV+ B-cell LPD. We report the case here as it underscores the difficulty in diagnosing age-related EBV+ B-cell LPDs and also suggests an important role of EBV in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms.","['Murase, Tadashi', 'Fujita, Ayumi', 'Ueno, Hironori', 'Park, Jae-Won', 'Yano, Takahiro', 'Hoshikawa, Masahiro', 'Takagi, Masayuki', 'Kuramochi, Shigeru']","['Murase T', 'Fujita A', 'Ueno H', 'Park JW', 'Yano T', 'Hoshikawa M', 'Takagi M', 'Kuramochi S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Tokai University Hachioji Hospital, 1838, Ishikawa-machi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0032, Japan. murase.tadashi@hachioji-hosp.tokai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan. murase.tadashi@hachioji-hosp.tokai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, St Marianna University, School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, St Marianna University, School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Aged', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Male']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0214-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0214-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Jan;89(1):80-85. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0214-0.

Combined with chemotherapy, imatinib exerts remarkable efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed disease with a complete remission (CR) rate of 95% and a survival rate of 55% at 3 years. Profound eradication of leukemia cells not only provides patients with a better chance for receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during first CR but also contributes to durable CR even without transplantation. Despite such improvement, however, relapse does occur, mainly owing to acquisition of resistance. Growing comprehension of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to imatinib has led to the development of novel BCR-ABL inhibitors that yield higher affinity for BCR-ABL and/or potent inhibitory activity against other target molecules such as SRC family kinases. The second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors, namely dasatinib and nilotinib, are already showing clinical activity in patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL, and other novel agents are undergoing preclinical and early clinical evaluation. Further improvement in treatment results will be achieved by identifying each patient's disease profile based on information obtained before and during treatment and by optimizing subsequent treatment accordingly.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Ohno, Ryuzo', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yanada M', 'Ohno R', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan. myanada@mte.biglobe.ne.jp.', 'Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy/trends', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0223-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0223-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Jan;89(1):3-13. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0223-z.

Most primary leukemia cells isolated from patients as well as three leukemia cell lines (HL-60, K562, and U937) all expressed Survivin gene. To investigate the relationship between Survivin and chemotherapeutic resistance, HL-60 cells were treated with daunorubicin (DNR), mitoxantrone (MIT) or arsenious oxide (As(2)O(3)), and it was found that after 24 h the level of Survivin mRNA was decreased by 9.7%, 41.0% and 27.5%, respectively. At 72 h, the level of Survivin mRNA was increased by 21.2% and 65.2% in HL-60 cells treated with DNR or MIT, but decreased by 33.2% in those treated with As(2)O(3) as compared with that in the cells treated for 24 h. These results showed that DNR and MIT could initally decrease the expression of Survivin and then increase it, but As(2)O(3) could decrease the Survivin expression continually. Furthermore, shRNA plasmids targeting the Survivin gene (pEGFP-Survivin), which can silence the expression of Survivin with a high specificity, were constructed. pEGFP-Survivin and pEGFP-H1 were transfected into HL-60 cells via electroporation and selected by G418, and HL-60/Survivin and HL-60/EGFP cells were obtained. After treatment with DNR, the cell survival rate and IC(50) of DNR in HL-60/Survivin cells were decreased substantially as compared with those of HL-60/EGFP and HL-60 cells (IC(50) of DNR: 18.3 +/- 2.45 vs 40.8 +/- 6.37 and 39.2 +/- 5.91 ng/ml, respectively), and the apoptosis rate was elevated ((84.3 +/- 19.7)% vs (45.8 +/- 13.8)% and (50.9 +/- 12.4)%, respectively). These results suggest that shRNA can down-regulate the expression of Survivin in HL-60 cells substantially and improve their sensitivity to DNR. They also further explain the pathogenesis of leukemia drug resistance and provide new theory in the design of clinical therapies.","['Wu, Yao-Hui', 'You, Yong', 'Chen, Zhi-Chao', 'Zou, Ping']","['Wu YH', 'You Y', 'Chen ZC', 'Zou P']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'Transfection']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']",['20081496 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2008;55(4):673-80.

Both HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 have evolved a complex genetic organization for optimal use of their limited genome and production of all necessary structural and regulatory proteins. Use of alternative splicing is essential for balanced expression of multiple viral regulators from one genomic polycistronic RNA. In addition, nuclear export of incompletely spliced RNA is required for production of structural and enzymatic proteins and virus particles. Decisions controlling these events are largely guarded by viral proteins. In human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, Rex and p30 are both nuclear/nucleolar RNA binding regulatory proteins. Rex interacts with a Rex-responsive element to stimulate nuclear export of incompletely spliced RNA and increase production of virus particles. In contrast, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 p30 is involved in the nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA leading to inhibition of virus expression and establishment of viral latency. How these two proteins, with apparently opposite functions, orchestrate virus replication and ensure vigilant control of viral gene expression is discussed.","['Baydoun, Hicham H', 'Bellon, Marcia', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Baydoun HH', 'Bellon M', 'Nicot C']","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, KU Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Spain,AIDS Rev,AIDS reviews,101134876,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (rex Protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Latency/genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,AIDS Rev. 2008 Oct-Dec;10(4):195-204.,,,"['R01 AI058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI058944-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2666328,,,,103,['NIHMS93091'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) RHAMM (receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility) as well as RHAMM splicing variants was assessed in series of 72 CLL patients. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR showed higher RHAMM expression in high-risk CLL patients, as well as in the advanced stages of the disease. CLL cases with a higher RHAMM expression showed a significantly shorter median treatment-free survival. Among patients with mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, an analysis of RHAMM expression enabled to distinguish subgroup of patients with favorable prognosis. In lymph nodes, RHAMM staining correlated with a higher Ki-67 index and CD40L expression. Functionally, stimulation with CD40L enhanced RHAMM expression in CLL. We further characterized RHAMM-specific CD8(+) T cells in patients with CLL, as the expression of TAAs might influence the clinical outcome by the means of immune reactions. The cytotoxic potential of RHAMM-specific T cells was shown against target cells bearing RHAMM-derived epitope as well as against CLL cells expressing RHAMM. In conclusion, RHAMM expression appears to be of prognostic value, as well as may reflect the proliferative capacity of CLL cells, and might therefore represent interesting target for immunotherapy.","['Giannopoulos, K', 'Mertens, D', 'Buhler, A', 'Barth, T F E', 'Idler, I', 'Moller, P', 'Krober, A', 'Greiner, J', 'Chocholska, S', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Rolinski, J', 'Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Schmitt, M']","['Giannopoulos K', 'Mertens D', 'Buhler A', 'Barth TF', 'Idler I', 'Moller P', 'Krober A', 'Greiner J', 'Chocholska S', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Rolinski J', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. giannop@tlen.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD40 Ligand/analysis/pharmacology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/physiology', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008338 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.338 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Mar;23(3):519-27. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.338.

TPA treatment induced the expression of the monocytic differentiation markers CD11b and CD36, with concomitant morphological changes. Moreover, TPA enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in these cells, and phagocytic ability was also stimulated during differentiation. The antioxidant agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibited the TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells. TPA treatment decreased the expression level of catalase, which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to H(2)O and O(2). In contrast, TPA increased the level of manganese superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into H(2)O(2) and O(2) without affecting the levels of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase 1, which removes H(2)O(2) using glutathione as substrate. Treatment of U937 cells with catalase inhibited the enhancement of ROS generation induced by TPA, and blocked the TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells. Human promyelocytic cell line HL60 cells were also induced to differentiate into macrophages by TPA. However, HP100-1 cells, its variant cell line overexpressing catalase, were resistant to TPA-induced differentiation. Our results suggest that catalase inhibits monocytic differentiation by TPA; the decrease in catalase level and the accumulation of H(2)O(2) are significant events for monocyte/macrophage differentiation by TPA.","['Yamamoto, T', 'Sakaguchi, N', 'Hachiya, M', 'Nakayama, F', 'Yamakawa, M', 'Akashi, M']","['Yamamoto T', 'Sakaguchi N', 'Hachiya M', 'Nakayama F', 'Yamakawa M', 'Akashi M']","['Department of Radiation Emergency Medicine, The Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba-City, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Catalase/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008353 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.353 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):761-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.353.

Following antigen stimulation, Syk is recruited to the BCR and becomes activated by phosphorylation at Y352. Recently, Syk was found to be constitutively phosphorylated in several common B-cell lymphoma subtypes, indicating a role for antigen-independent Syk activation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We now report that Syk is constitutively phosphorylated on the activating Y352 residue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. To examine the effects of constitutive Syk activity on intracellular signaling and leukemic cell survival, we performed in vitro studies with the Syk inhibitor R406. Treatment with R406 induced leukemic cell apoptosis in the majority of investigated cases and affected the basal activity or expression of several pro-survival molecules regulated by Syk, including the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinases, and the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. In addition, R406 prevented the increase in leukemic cell viability induced by sustained BCR engagement and inhibited BCR-induced Akt activation and Mcl-1 upregulation. Collectively, these data identify Syk as a potential target for CLL treatment and suggest that inhibition of this kinase could provide a double therapeutic benefit by disrupting both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent signaling pathways that regulate leukemic cell survival.","['Gobessi, S', 'Laurenti, L', 'Longo, P G', 'Carsetti, L', 'Berno, V', 'Sica, S', 'Leone, G', 'Efremov, D G']","['Gobessi S', 'Laurenti L', 'Longo PG', 'Carsetti L', 'Berno V', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['ICGEB Molecular Hematology Group, Campus A Buzzati-Traverso, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0', '(N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-pyrid(1,4)oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyph', 'enyl)-2,4-pyrimidinediamine)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxazines/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008346 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.346 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):686-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.346.

Methyl jasmonate (MJ) is very effective at inducing the myelomonocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. We examined the gene expression profiles associated with exposure to MJ using cDNA microarrays, and compared the results with those obtained with other inducers of differentiation, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD(3)), isopentenyladenine (IPA) and cotylenin A (CN-A). Many genes were upregulated, and only a small fraction was downregulated, upon exposure to the inducers. MJ, IPA and CN-A, but not ATRA or VD(3), immediately induced the expression of mRNA for the calcium-binding protein S100P. The gene expression profile induced by MJ resembled that induced by IPA, suggesting that these inducers share many common signal transduction systems for inducing the differentiation of leukemia cells. Methyl 4,5-didehydrojasmonate was about 30 times more potent than MJ and the natural form of the stereoisomer was more effective than the unnatural isomer. It significantly stimulated both the functional and morphological differentiation of leukemia cells that had been freshly isolated from patients with hematological malignancies. Jasmonate derivatives may be promising therapeutic agents for differentiation therapy of leukemia.","['Tsumura, H', 'Akimoto, M', 'Kiyota, H', 'Ishii, Y', 'Ishikura, H', 'Honma, Y']","['Tsumura H', 'Akimoto M', 'Kiyota H', 'Ishii Y', 'Ishikura H', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Life Science, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Cytokinins)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (methyl 4,5-didehydrojasmonate)', '2365-40-4 (N(6)-(delta(2)-isopentenyl)adenine)', '7724-76-7 (Isopentenyladenosine)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)']",IM,"['Acetates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Cytokinins/*pharmacology', 'Esters/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isopentenyladenosine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oxylipins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008347 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.347 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Apr;23(4):753-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.347.

Research efforts are now focused on how to optimize therapeutic strategies in an attempt to improve clinical results further, counteract the development of drug resistance and reduce adverse effects. A randomized, international, phase III study of dasatinib dose and schedule optimization in imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients with CML has demonstrated that intermittent target inhibition can preserve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity.

Some genes may be involved in the degenerative process itself whereas others may be part of an endogenous defense system. We show in two models of retinal degeneration that photoreceptor death strongly induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in a subset of Muller glia cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. LIF expression is essential to induce an extensive intraretinal signaling system which includes Muller cells and photoreceptors and is characterized by an upregulation of Edn2, STAT3, FGF2 and GFAP. In the absence of LIF, Muller cells remain quiescent, the signaling system is not activated and retinal degeneration is strongly accelerated. Intravitreal application of recombinant LIF induces the full molecular pathway including the activation of Muller cells in wild-type and Lif(-/-) mice. Interruption of the signaling cascade by an Edn2 receptor antagonist increases whereas activation of the receptor decreases photoreceptor cell death. Thus, LIF is essential and sufficient to activate an extensive molecular defense response to photoreceptor injury. Our data establish LIF as a Muller cell derived neuronal survival factor which controls an intrinsic protective mechanism that includes Edn2 signaling to support photoreceptor cell survival and to preserve vision in the injured retina.","['Joly, Sandrine', 'Lange, Christina', 'Thiersch, Markus', 'Samardzija, Marijana', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Joly S', 'Lange C', 'Thiersch M', 'Samardzija M', 'Grimm C']","['Laboratory for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, Center for Integrative Human Physiology and Neuroscience Center Zurich, University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Endothelins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '143113-45-5 (BQ 3020)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Endothelins/administration & dosage', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/genetics/*metabolism', 'Light/adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neuroglia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage', 'Phosphorylation', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/*metabolism/pathology/radiation effects', 'Retinal Degeneration/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]']","['28/51/13765 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5114-08.2008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2008 Dec 17;28(51):13765-74. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5114-08.2008.,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5114-08.2008 [doi],,,PMC6671917,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cohorts were followed from baseline through 2002 (Sweden) and through 2004 (Finland). RESULTS: We found a risk increase of myeloma with a relative risk (RR) of 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.7) among obese persons, a RR of 2.5 (1.0-6.2) for chronic myeloid leukaemia and a RR of 2.7 (0.8-9.6) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia among overweight persons as compared to normal-weighted ones.

However, GSIs seem to be active in only a small fraction of T-ALL cell lines with constitutive Notch-1 activity and the downstream response of Notch signaling is only partially understood. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying proliferation suppression and apoptosis and explore effective downstream target genes, we used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to down-regulate the expression of Notch-1 in GSIs-resistant T-ALL cell lines. Results showed that down-regulation of Notch-1 by transfection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause SupT1 cells proliferation inhibition by inducing G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The proliferation inhibitory and apoptotic effects resulting from down-regulation of Notch-1 may be mediated through regulating the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, CDK2 and p21 and the activity of Akt signaling. In addition, our results demonstrated that down-regulation of Notch-1 signaling could sensitize SupT1 cells to adriamycin. Taken together, cell cycle regulatory proteins and Akt signaling may be attractive targets in T-ALL.","['Guo, Dongmei', 'Ye, Jingjing', 'Dai, Jianjian', 'Li, Lizhen', 'Chen, Feng', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Guo D', 'Ye J', 'Dai J', 'Li L', 'Chen F', 'Ma D', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptor, Notch1/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(08)00480-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.10.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 May;33(5):678-85. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.10.026.

We evaluated the semen parameters and associated malignancies of men with cancer who cryopreserved sperm at our institution before undergoing therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the database from our cryopreservation laboratory during a 5-year period. Office charts of 409 of 1,409 patients were available for review. Age at banking, semen volume, sperm density, percent motile sperm and type of cancer were recorded. Semen parameters were compared to values for fertile and subfertile men established by the National Cooperative Reproductive Medicine Network as well as from a large local pre-vasectomy cohort to consider geographic variations. RESULTS: A total of 717 semen samples from 409 men included 45% with testicular cancer, 10% with Hodgkin's lymphoma, 7% with nonHodgkin's lymphoma, 6% with sarcoma, 6% with prostate cancer, 5% with leukemia, 3% with gastrointestinal cancer and 2% with central nervous system tumors. Of these men 16% had unspecified or other rare malignancies. Mean patient age was 29.9 years (range 11.9 to 87.7), mean semen volume was 2.8 ml (range 0.1 to 15.0), mean sperm density was 47.4 x 10(6)/ml (range 0.1 to 320) and mean sperm motility was 50.0% (range 1% to 90%). For men with testicular cancer sperm density and motility were in the intermediate range. Parameters for men with all other malignancies were in the fertile range for density and intermediate range for motility. CONCLUSIONS: Men with most types of cancer have pretreatment semen parameters in the fertile range for density and in the intermediate range for motility. However, men with testicular cancer statistically have lower semen quality compared to those with other malignancies. These findings further highlight the importance of pretreatment fertility preservation in this patient population before undergoing gonadotoxic treatments.","['Williams, Daniel H 4th', 'Karpman, Edward', 'Sander, James C', 'Spiess, Philippe E', 'Pisters, Louis L', 'Lipshultz, Larry I']","['Williams DH 4th', 'Karpman E', 'Sander JC', 'Spiess PE', 'Pisters LL', 'Lipshultz LI']","['University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53792, USA. williams@surgery.wisc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Preoperative Care/methods', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', '*Semen Analysis', 'Semen Preservation/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Motility/physiology']",2008/12/19 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2008/12/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5347(08)02709-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2008.10.023 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2009 Feb;181(2):736-40. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2008.10.023.

PROCEDURES: : We used an aqueous whole plant extract of H. niger in different cancer and leukemia cell lines and primary cells of patients with childhood ALL and AML and identified the main mechanisms of action. RESULTS: A strong inhibition of proliferation is caused by specific apoptosis induction, which is executed via the mitochondrial pathway and caspase-3 processing. Apoptosis could be detected in lymphoma (BJAB), leukemia (Reh, Nalm6, Sup-B15) and melanoma (Mel-HO) cells and overcomes a Bcl-2-mediated block of apoptosis. In primary cells of patients with childhood ALL and AML, which were partly poor responding to doxorubicin and daunorubicin, a strong apoptosis induction was determined. In combination with the vinca alkaloid vincristine, strong synergistic effects were detected in BJAB cells.

However, only 8 species have been so far recovered from human beings. Different techniques (molecular and non-molecular) have been employed for rapid and efficient diagnosis of herpesviruses especially in case ofimmunocompromised hosts who are considered as high risk individuals. An indirect in-house ELISA was standardized to measure IgG antibody against Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) in sera from different groups of individuals. In the process of optimization of in-house ELISA, optimal dilutions of antigen, serum, conjugate and monoclonal IgG antibody along with selection of efficient blocking buffer and washing steps of microtitre plates were studied by the help of checkerboarding. The results were calculated according to Specific Binding Ratio (SBR) and cut-off procedures. The efficiency of newly developed indirect in-house ELISA was attempted and results were compared with data previously obtained by the agency of commercial kits or other serological techniques. The latter helped to investigate different technical aspects of in-house ELISA. When accuracy of ELISA was confirmed the protocol was applied in screening of the sera from immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts that facilitated examination of the clinical aspects of the hosts. Diethylamine (DEA) in 20, 35 and 70 mM concentrations were used in order to assay IgG antibody avidity. The IgG avidity index was calculated by dividing OD of each sera obtained with denaturant to OD of the same specimen without application of denaturants. Avidity indices proved to be an important tool to differentiate between primary and recurrent infections and between seropositivity and seronegativity.","['Fard, A H Mohagheghi', 'Pam, J Vallely']","['Fard AH', 'Pam JV']","['Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Zahedan Medical University, P.O.

Traditional feature selection methods consider multiple classes equally without paying attention to the upregulation/downregulation across the normal and diseased classes; while the specific gene selection methods for biomarker discovery particularly consider differential gene expressions across the normal and diseased classes, but ignore the existence of multiple classes. More importantly, there are few visualization algorithms to assist biomarker discovery from microarray data. In this paper, to help users visually analyze microarray data and improve biomarker discovery, we propose to employ matrix reordering techniques that have been developed and used in matrix computation. In particular, we generalized a well-known population genetic algorithm, namely, replicator dynamics, to reorder a microarray data matrix with multiple classes. The new algorithm simultaneously takes into account the global between-class data pattern and local within-class data pattern. Our results showed that our matrix reordering algorithm not only provides a visualization method to effectively analyze microarray data on both genes and samples, but also improves the accuracy of classifying the samples.","['Liu, Ying', 'Li, Wenyuan']","['Liu Y', 'Li W']","['Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA. ying.liu@utdallas.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,J Bioinform Comput Biol,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,101187344,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/statistics & numerical data', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0219720008003862 [pii]', '10.1142/s0219720008003862 [doi]']",ppublish,J Bioinform Comput Biol. 2008 Dec;6(6):1089-113. doi: 10.1142/s0219720008003862.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prognostic index based on widely available clinical and laboratory features was recently developed to predict survival among patients with previously untreated CLL. This index requires validation in an independent series of patients before widespread use can be recommended. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic CLL database was used to evaluate the validity and reproducibility of the new prognostic index. RESULTS: A total of 440 patients with newly diagnosed CLL who were seen at the Mayo Clinic within 12 months of diagnosis and for whom data were available with which to calculate index score were identified. Patients were classified as low, intermediate, or high risk using the prognostic index. The estimated median survival times were: not reached for low risk, 10.1 years for intermediate risk, and 7.2 years for high risk. The estimated median and 5-year survival by prognostic index risk category were similar to those originally reported. The prognostic index risk category added predictive value beyond that of Rai risk alone (P=.004). The prognostic index risk category remained a predictor of survival when analysis was limited to Rai stage 0 (P=.03) and nonreferred patients (P<.0001) and also predicted time to treatment (P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study confirm the ability of a newly developed prognostic index to predict survival among patients with previously untreated CLL. The study also extended the utility of the index by demonstrating that it is useful at diagnosis, retains prognostic value when applied exclusively to Rai stage 0 patients, is effective in nonreferred patients, and predicts time to treatment.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Jenkins, Greg', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Slager, Susan', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Schwager, Susan', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Jenkins G', 'Call TG', 'Zent CS', 'Slager S', 'Bowen DA', 'Schwager S', 'Hanson CA', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24004 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Jan 15;115(2):363-72. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24004.,10.1002/cncr.24004 [doi],,"['K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA113408-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2629134,,,,,['NIHMS84328'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 641 patients with de novo ALL who were treated with the hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) regimen or its variants were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (2.49%) developed secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (6 patients) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (10 patients). At the time of ALL diagnosis, the median age was 53 years; cytogenetics were normal in 11 patients, pseudo-diploidy with del(2) in 1 patient, t(9;22) in 1 patient, and unavailable in 3 patients. Frontline therapy included hyper-CVAD in 7 patients, hyper-CVAD with rituximab in 8 patients, and hyper-CVAD with imatinib in 1 patient. Karyotype at time of AML/MDS diagnosis was -5, -7 in 9 patients, normal in 1 patient, complex in 1 patient, inv(11) in 1 patient, t(4;11) in 1 patient, del(20) in 1 patient, and unavailable in 2 patients. Secondary AML/MDS developed at a median of 32 months after ALL diagnosis. Cytarabine plus anthracycline-based treatment was given to 12 patients with AML and high-risk MDS. One patient with MDS received arsenic trioxide, 1 received clofarabine, and 2 received decitabine. Response to treatment was complete remission in 3 patients, partial remission in 6 patients, and no response in 6 patients; 1 patient was untreated. Eight patients (1 with AML and 7 with MDS) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and all but 2 died at a median of 3 months (range, 0.5-11 months) after transplantation. The median overall survival after a diagnosis of secondary AML and MDS was 9.25 months (range, 1+ to 26+ months). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary AML and MDS occur infrequently in adult patients with de novo ALL treated with the hyper-CVAD regimens, and response to therapy is poor.","['Verma, Dushyant', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Koller, Charles', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Verma D', ""O'Brien S"", 'Thomas D', 'Faderl S', 'Koller C', 'Pierce S', 'Kebriaei P', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Here, we report data that indicate the oncoprotein Ras as a possible mediator of Tax-induced apoptosis protection and suggest a possible role of Tax in Ras activation. In addition, using inhibitors of down stream effectors of Ras, we found that ERK signaling is the most relevant for Tax-mediated apoptosis protection. As a whole, our findings provide intriguing evidence of a possible link between Ras signaling and Tax capability to counteract apoptosis and to enhance P-CREB levels, and implicates a potential role for Ras in HTLV-1-induced diseases.","['Vajente, Nicola', 'Trevisan, Roberta', 'Saggioro, Daniela']","['Vajente N', 'Trevisan R', 'Saggioro D']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, Oncology Section, University of Padova, via Gattamelata 64, 35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RASA2 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'N21T0D88LX (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Prenylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/metabolism']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0289-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 Feb;14(2):153-63. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0289-3.,10.1007/s10495-008-0289-3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we confirm the stimulatory effects of mouse SPARC on cardiomyogenesis using a recombinant baculovirus-produced protein (rmSPARC). Embryoid bodies cultured in the presence of glycosylated rmSPARC, or an unglycosylated peptide spanning the C-terminal EF-hand domain, developed greater numbers of beating cardiomyocytes than did time-matched controls, with enhanced expression of cardiac marker genes including Nkx2.5, Troponin, BMP-2, and MHCalpha. Histochemical analysis revealed an expansion of the peripheral endoderm, with thicker layers of extracellular matrix (ECM) material observed atop underlying cells. Embryoid bodies treated with SPARC also displayed increased adherence to polystyrene culture dishes, with enhanced expression of ECM mRNAs including collagen IValpha3, collagen IValpha5, and laminin alpha1. These results indicate that, in addition to the promotion of cardiomyogenesis, SPARC may also help regulate the molecular composition and organization of ECM secreted by the mesenchymal parietal endoderm.","['Hrabchak, Christopher', 'Ringuette, Maurice', 'Woodhouse, Kimberly']","['Hrabchak C', 'Ringuette M', 'Woodhouse K']","['Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, 200 College Street, Toronto, ON M5S, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Osteonectin)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Endoderm/cytology/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Heart/*embryology', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/*cytology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/*physiology', 'Osteonectin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['o08-141 [pii]', '10.1139/O08-141 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2008 Dec;86(6):487-99. doi: 10.1139/O08-141.,10.1139/O08-141 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate significant activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and its upstream activator Janus kinase (JAK)2, in high-grade ovarian carcinomas compared with normal ovaries and benign tumours. The association between STAT3 activation and migratory phenotype of ovarian cancer cells was investigated by EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in OVCA 433 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of EGFR induced a fibroblast-like morphology and migratory phenotype, consistent with the upregulation of mesenchyme-associated N-cadherin, vimentin and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. This occurred concomitantly with activation of the downstream JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Both cell lines expressed interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), and treatment with EGF within 1 h resulted in a several-fold enhancement of mRNA expression of IL-6. Consistent with that, EGF treatment of both OVCA 433 and SKOV3 cell lines resulted in enhanced IL-6 production in the serum-free medium. Exogenous addition of IL-6 to OVCA 433 cells stimulated STAT3 activation and enhanced migration. Blocking antibodies against IL-6R inhibited IL-6 production and EGF- and IL-6-induced migration. Specific inhibition of STAT3 activation by JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 blocked STAT3 phosphorylation, cell motility, induction of N-cadherin and vimentin expression and IL6 production. These data suggest that the activated status of STAT3 in high-grade ovarian carcinomas may occur directly through activation of EGFR or IL-6R or indirectly through induction of IL-6R signalling. Such activation of STAT3 suggests a rationale for a combination of anti-STAT3 and EGFR/IL-6R therapy to suppress the peritoneal spread of ovarian cancer.","['Colomiere, M', 'Ward, A C', 'Riley, C', 'Trenerry, M K', 'Cameron-Smith, D', 'Findlay, J', 'Ackland, L', 'Ahmed, N']","['Colomiere M', 'Ward AC', 'Riley C', 'Trenerry MK', 'Cameron-Smith D', 'Findlay J', 'Ackland L', 'Ahmed N']","[""Women's Cancer Research Centre, Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH2 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cadherins/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology', 'ErbB Receptors/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Janus Kinase 2/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis', 'Mesoderm/*cytology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Vimentin/analysis', 'beta Catenin/analysis']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]']","['6604794 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604794 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Jan 13;100(1):134-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604794.

While this observation may partly be explained by the coexistence of multiple genetic sub-clones arising through independent somatic mutations and/or as a result of differentiation processes in the tumor microenvironment, it also implies that the tumor may be formed from undifferentiated ''stem cell-like'' cells called ''cancer stem cells'' or ''cancer-initiating cells''. These cells are thought to constitute one or several rare subpopulations in a given tumor and would be strongly responsible for initiation of tumor development and growth as well as for metastasis and recurrence after cytoreductive therapy. However, while the concept of cancer stem cells has been first established for human myeloid leukemia in the 1960s, it has only much later been extended to other solid tumors such as breast or brain cancers and most recently to melanoma. Thus, it is presently unclear which role a sufficiently characterized population of melanoma stem cells plays in cancer promotion and progression. Here, we review the emerging melanoma stem cell model and discuss the biological and therapeutic implications of the model.","['Menaa, F', 'Houben, R', 'Eyrich, M', 'Broecker, E B', 'Becker, J C', 'Wischhusen, J']","['Menaa F', 'Houben R', 'Eyrich M', 'Broecker EB', 'Becker JC', 'Wischhusen J']","['Department of Dermatology and Dermato-Oncology, University of Wuerzburg, School of Medicine, Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",8102852,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Dedifferentiation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplasms/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['R23083889 [pii]'],ppublish,G Ital Dermatol Venereol. 2009 Jun;144(3):287-96.

This disruption is achieved through the action of the viral E4 Orf3 protein, which forms track-like nuclear structures that associate with the PML protein. This association is mediated by a direct interaction of Orf3 with a specific PML isoform, PMLII. We show here that the Orf3 interaction properties of PMLII are conferred by a 40 aa residue segment of the unique C-terminal domain of the protein. This segment was sufficient to confer interaction on a heterologous protein. The analysis was informed by prior application of a bioinformatic tool for the prediction of potential protein interaction sites within unstructured protein sequences (predictors of naturally disordered region analysis; PONDR). This tool predicted three potential molecular recognition elements (MoRE) within the C-terminal domain of PMLII, one of which was found to form the core of the Orf3 interaction site, thus demonstrating the utility of this approach. The sequence of the mapped Orf3-binding site on PML protein was found to be relatively poorly conserved across other species; however, the overall organization of MoREs within unstructured sequence was retained, suggesting the potential for conservation of functional interactions.","['Leppard, Keith N', 'Emmott, Edward', 'Cortese, Marc S', 'Rich, Tina']","['Leppard KN', 'Emmott E', 'Cortese MS', 'Rich T']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.

We determined the effects of ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1, on apoptosis induction alone and in combination with CPT-11 and explored mechanisms underlying their cooperativity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (HCT116 wild-type and Bax(-/-), HT-29, and RKO) were incubated with ABT-737 alone and combined with CPT-11 or bortezomib, and cell viability, caspase cleavage, and Annexin V labeling were measured. In drug-treated cell lines, protein-protein interactions were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Lentiviral short hairpin RNA was used to knockdown Noxa expression. RESULTS: ABT-737 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and its coadministration with the topoisomerase I inhibitor, CPT-11, resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect. Apoptosis induction by the drug combination was associated with enhanced caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage that were completely abrogated in Bax knockout cells. ABT-737 unsequestered the BH3-only protein Bim from its complex with Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 and disrupted the interaction of Bcl-xL with Bak. CPT-11 treatment up-regulated Noxa expression, as did bortezomib, and enhanced Noxa/Mcl-1 complexes. CPT-11 also disrupted the Mcl-1/Bak interaction. Knockdown of Noxa using short hairpin RNA lentiviral constructs was shown to significantly attenuate the cytotoxic effect of CPT-11 or bortezomib combined with ABT-737 and inhibited caspase-3 cleavage. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of Noxa by CPT-11 or bortezomib can sensitize colorectal cancer cells expressing Mcl-1 to ABT-737. Up-regulation of Noxa may therefore represent an important strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ABT-737 against colorectal cancer and other solid tumors.","['Okumura, Kenji', 'Huang, Shengbing', 'Sinicrope, Frank A']","['Okumura K', 'Huang S', 'Sinicrope FA']","['Miles and Shirley Fiterman Center for Digestive Diseases and Division of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]']","['14/24/8132 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1665 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Dec 15;14(24):8132-42. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1665.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1665 [doi],,"['R01 CA104683-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083-36/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2948478,,,,,['NIHMS225427'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ninety-six fully characterized CLL cases were assessed for in vitro sensitivity to LC-1 and fludarabine. In selected cases, caspase activation, inhibition of Rel A DNA binding, and the transcription of CFLAR, BIRC5, and BCL2 were measured before and after exposure to LC-1. In addition, the efficacy of LC-1 was assessed in the presence of the survival factors CD154 and interleukin-4, and the potential synergistic interaction between LC-1 and fludarabine was evaluated. RESULTS: Cell death was associated with caspase-3 activation mediated via activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9. Apoptosis was preceded by a reduction of nuclear Rel A DNA binding and inhibition of CFLAR, BIRC5, and BCL2 transcription. Importantly, LC-1 overcame the cytoprotective effects by interleukin-4 and CD40 ligand and was equipotent in CLL cells derived from good and bad prognostic subsets. LC-1 exhibited strong synergy with fludarabine, and the combination produced a highly significant mean dose reduction index for fludarabine of > 1,000. CONCLUSIONS: In view of imminent first-in-man study of LC-1 in Cardiff, these data show an important mechanistic rationale for the use of LC-1 in this disease. Furthermore, it validates the concept of targeting nuclear factor-kappaB in CLL and identifies the therapeutic potential of LC-1 in combination with fludarabine even in patients with fludarabine resistance.","['Hewamana, Saman', 'Lin, Thet Thet', 'Jenkins, Chris', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Rowntree, Clare', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Hewamana S', 'Lin TT', 'Jenkins C', 'Burnett AK', 'Jordan CT', 'Fegan C', 'Brennan P', 'Rowntree C', 'Pepper C']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom. hewamanas@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (LC-1 compound)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Prognosis', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]']","['14/24/8102 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1673 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Dec 15;14(24):8102-11. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1673.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1673 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty hospitalized leukemia patients completed a brief survey of HT knowledge/experience. A prospective cohort (N = 12) was invited to participate in an HT intervention (9 30-minute sessions over 3 weeks); they completed measures of distress, symptoms, and sleep (at weeks 1 and 5), and completed single item ratings of fatigue, nausea, distress, and pain immediately pre-post selected HT sessions. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze change in pre-post session ratings and distress, symptom, and sleep measures. RESULTS: Among survey respondents, 8% had used HT in the past, and 71% were interested in using HT. In the prospective cohort, there were significant pre-post session improvements in fatigue and nausea (but not in distress and pain). There were no significant changes between weeks 1 and 5 in distress, symptoms, or sleep. Ratings and qualitative feedback on HT were positive, focused mainly on feeling relaxed following HT sessions. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to recruit patients hospitalized for acute leukemia to a study of HT. Preliminary data on short-term improvements in symptoms indicate these are promising outcomes for future study.","['Danhauer, Suzanne C', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Holder, Paige', 'Miller, Christina', 'Jesse, Michelle T']","['Danhauer SC', 'Tooze JA', 'Holder P', 'Miller C', 'Jesse MT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1082, USA. danhauer@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Soc Integr Oncol,Journal of the Society for Integrative Oncology,101262057,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/physiopathology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychological Tests', 'Psychometrics', 'Qualitative Research', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Therapeutic Touch', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/12/18 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2008/12/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Soc Integr Oncol. 2008 Summer;6(3):89-97.,,,['P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3891375,,,,,['NIHMS529226'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 158 patients with newly diagnosed APL who were treated with combination of red arsenic sulfide, ATRA, and anthracyclin were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The frequency of additional chromosome abnormalities in the APL patients was 18.4%, and trisomy 8 and i17q- were the most to be seen. The disseminated intravascular coagulation rate of the patients with additional chromosome abnormality was 62.1%, significantly higher than that of the patients without additional chromosome abnormality (35.6%, P < 0.05). The complete remission rate of the patients with additional chromosome abnormality was 75.9%, not significantly lower than that of those without additional chromosome abnormality (90.7%), and the relapse rate and incidence rate of central nervous system leukemia were 13.8% and 17.2%, both higher, but not significantly, than those of the patients without additional chromosome abnormality (6.2% and 6.2% respectively) (all P > 0.05).

Using Bayesian clustering, we replicate a series of (unsupervised) data clustering tasks, usually performed manually by the expert. The proposed methodology is able to incorporate the expert's knowledge, as prior information to data-driven statistical learning methods, in a simple and efficient way. We observe almost optimal clustering results, with respect to the expert's gold standard.

The homolytic bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) and ionization potential (IP(koopman)) were calculated by the DFT/B3LYP method. The cytotoxicity was investigated using tumor cells (human submandibular gland carcinoma cells, HSG; human promyelocytic leukemia cells, HL-60) and primary cells (human gingival fibroblasts, HGF; human periodontal ligament fibroblasts, HPLF; human pulp fibroblasts, HPF) derived from oral tissues. The cytotoxicity between tumor and primary cells was similar, except for eugenol dimer showing less toxicity for primary cells. The DPPH assay was not useful for tert-butylphenols due to their steric hindrance. For both HSG and HGF cells, a linear relationship was found between 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) and inhibition rate constant (k(inh)), but not BDE, IP, or logP.

Second, pathologic profiles are critical to comprehensive dietary evaluation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats assigned to 2 groups, ad libitum (AL) and dietary restricted (DR), were fed the AIN-93M (casein protein) diet free choice and reduced in amount by 31%, respectively. At 58 weeks of age, the predominant types of lesions in AL and DR rats were pituitary and skin tumors. At 114 weeks of age, the most common lesions were pituitary, adrenal gland, skin, mammary, brain, and pancreatic tumors and mononuclear cell leukemia. However, DR had no significant effect on these lesions. Primary findings demonstrate that DR significantly reduced the total number of tumors per rat and incidence of benign and primary tumors (all organs) but did not reduce the incidence of malignant tumors (all organs). Dietary restriction increased the percentage of unknown deaths. These results may explain why survival rates for AL and DR rats were not significantly different at 114 weeks (43.3 vs 57.5%, respectively). These findings differ from previous studies using NIH-31 cereal diet (Aging Clin Exp Res 2001;13:263; J Nutr 2002;132:101; Aging Clin Exp Res 2003;16(6):68; Aging Clin Exp Res 2004;16:448) where neoplastic lesions rather than nonneoplastic lesions were linked to a significant increase in survival rate among cohorts of DR-fed rats (J Nutr 2002;132:101). Factors such as diet composition and digestibility, although not independent of body weight, may have contributed to differences in rat mortality and may affect humans in a similar manner.","['Duffy, Peter H', 'Lewis, Sherry M', 'Mayhugh, Martha A', 'Trotter, Ronald W', 'Hass, Bruce S', 'Latendresse, John R', 'Thorn, Brett T', 'Tobin, Graham', 'Feuers, Ritchie J']","['Duffy PH', 'Lewis SM', 'Mayhugh MA', 'Trotter RW', 'Hass BS', 'Latendresse JR', 'Thorn BT', 'Tobin G', 'Feuers RJ']","['Division of Genetic and Reproductive Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, FDA, Jefferson, AR 72079, USA. peter.duffy@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nutr Res,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",8303331,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aging/*physiology', 'Animal Feed', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', '*Caloric Restriction', 'Caseins/*administration & dosage', 'Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Incidence', 'Longevity/physiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/07 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [medline]']","['S0271-5317(07)00234-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nutres.2007.09.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutr Res. 2008 Jan;28(1):36-42. doi: 10.1016/j.nutres.2007.09.018.,10.1016/j.nutres.2007.09.018 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current research is focused on development of molecularly targeted agents, an era ushered in with the discovery of imatinib mesylate for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Since imatinib's introduction into the clinic, an increasing number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed and entered into clinical trials and practice. Parallel to the initial advances made in molecularly targeted agents has been the development of a spectrum of novel imaging modalities. Future goals for imaging in childhood cancer research thus include (1) patient identification based on target identification or other biologic characteristics of the tumor, (2) assessing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) effects, and (3) predictive value with an early indication of patient benefit. Development and application of novel imaging modalities for children with cancer can serve to streamline development of molecularly targeted agents.","['Adamson, Peter C']",['Adamson PC'],"[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. adamsonp@upenn.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00247-008-1016-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2009 Feb;39 Suppl 1:S38-41. doi: 10.1007/s00247-008-1016-5.

METHOD: A retrospective chart review of PCA-treated children with mucositis was carried out over a 6-year period (2000-2006) at the university hospital for children in Erlangen. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 12.6 years and they mainly suffered from forms of acute leukemia. Daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) requirements increased with the start of the PCA therapy from 14.5 mg/day to 18.7 mg/day (p=0.021; Wilcoxon test). Children required more opioids by bolus request during the night (10:01 p.m. to 06:00 a.m.; 6.28 mg; 13%) than during the other 8-hour intervals (06:01 a.m. to 02:00 p.m. and 02:01 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.; both 21.3 mg (43.5%) during the whole 10-day study period. In 8 out of 10 days there was a significant diurnal variation in opioid requirement with significantly lower requirement during the night (p<0.05 Friedman test). The median count of delivered and un-delivered bolus requests during the night was 0-1 and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCA seems to be an ideal, dependable and feasible mode of analgesic administration for the individual titration of dose in children with chemotherapy-induced mucositis. This is expressed through the increase in daily self-administered opioid doses after starting PCA, the huge interindividual variability in opioid consumption and the rare event of an un-delivered bolus request during lock-out time. With the use of a background infusion, additional bolus requests are rare during the night.","['Schiessl, C', 'Schestag, I', 'Griessinger, N', 'Sittl, R', 'Zernikow, B']","['Schiessl C', 'Schestag I', 'Griessinger N', 'Sittl R', 'Zernikow B']","['Anasthesiologische Klinik, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Deutschland.

However, treatment of maternal CML with imatinib during gestation is not recommended because of the potential risk to the fetus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation, course and outcome of one pregnant patient with CML who was treated with imatinib. We review all pregnancies associated with imatinib documented in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old pregnant patient was diagnosed to have Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic phase CML in August 2007. Imatinib was administered (400 mg/day) between the 21st and 39th weeks of gestation. The patient tolerated the drug well and achieved complete hematological and cytogenetic remission. There were no imatinib-related maternal complications during the pregnancy. Fetal growth remained normal as well as amniotic fluid volume estimation. Labor was induced at the 39th gestational week, resulting in the uneventful vaginal delivery of a healthy male infant without any congenital anomaly. Umbilical cord blood and infant peripheral blood were collected at delivery. No postnatal complications occurred; however, imatinib was present in the umbilical cord blood (338 ng/mL) and in the infant's peripheral blood (478 ng/mL). Breast milk was collected on different postpartum days, and concentrations of imatinib were detected. At 10 months of age, the baby had normal growth and development. CONCLUSIONS: In light of reported cases and our experience, treatment of CML during the second and third trimesters of gestation and breast feeding seems to be safe, but the data are still limited and the effects of chronic exposure of infants to imatinib are not known. We think that each case should be examined and considered independently, and decisions should be individualized.","['Ali, Ridvan', 'Ozkalemkas, Fahir', 'Kimya, Yalcin', 'Koksal, Nilgun', 'Ozkocaman, Vildan', 'Gulten, Tuna', 'Yorulmaz, Hakan', 'Tunali, Ahmet']","['Ali R', 'Ozkalemkas F', 'Kimya Y', 'Koksal N', 'Ozkocaman V', 'Gulten T', 'Yorulmaz H', 'Tunali A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University School of Medicine, Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey. ridvanali@uludag.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Arch Gynecol Obstet,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,8710213,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant, Newborn/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Milk, Human/chemistry', 'Piperazines/analysis/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/analysis/blood/*therapeutic use']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00404-008-0861-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2009 Aug;280(2):169-75. doi: 10.1007/s00404-008-0861-7.

The induction of the EBV lytic cycle was done by a non-stressing dose of 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (8 nM). Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde as a parameter of lipid peroxidation, the levels of glutathione, and the activities of three antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase). After 48 h (peak of lytic cycle), a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity was observed in B95-8, Raji, and LCL C1 cells (P < 0.05). In addition, in B95-8 cells also a significant decrease of catalase activity was detected (P < 0.05). The glutathione peroxidase activity and the glutathione level were not significantly modified by the induction in any of the cell lines. We found a significant rise in malondialdehyde levels in B95-8, Raji, and LCL C1 cells after the induction of the lytic cycle compared to controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, induction of EBV lytic cycle in lymphoblastoid cells causes increased oxidative stress in the host cells within 48 h, a process that could be involved in malignant transformations.","['Gargouri, Bochra', 'Van Pelt, Jos', 'El Feki, Abd El Fatteh', 'Attia, Hammadi', 'Lassoued, Saloua']","['Gargouri B', 'Van Pelt J', 'El Feki Ael F', 'Attia H', 'Lassoued S']","['Unite de Biotechnologie et Pathologies, Institut Superieur de Biotechnologie de Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia. bochragargouri@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Oxidants)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Oxidants/analysis', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-008-9984-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2009 Apr;324(1-2):55-63. doi: 10.1007/s11010-008-9984-1.

The anti-vascular agent 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) emerged as derivative of the flavone-8-acetic acid (FAA) and xanthenone-4-acetic acid (XAA). Its anti-vascular activity is not based on direct cytotoxic effects, but is characterized by an immune-mediated component, through the activation of NF-kappaB pathway, and a direct anti-vascular action, involving the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis and changes in tumour vessel permeability. Despite promising pre-clinical results, DMXAA showed moderate anti-tumour activity in clinical trials. In this study, we compared to DMXAA the in vitro immune-modulating and the anti-vascular properties of two XAA analogues, AP/1649 and AP/1897. Their immune-stimulating activities were evaluated on a human monocyte cell line and their anti-vascular activities were studied by measuring the induction of HUVECs apoptosis and using DCE-MRI to determine tumour perfusion following drug treatment. Although the two molecules exerted an immune stimulation comparable to that produced by DMXAA, they showed reduced (AP/1649) or minimal (AP/1897) anti-vascular activity in vitro, and no anti-vascular effects in vivo. These results endorse the current theories concerning two independent actions exerted by DMXAA.","['Barbera, Mariagnese', 'Kettunen, Mikko I', 'Caputo, Anna', 'Hu, De-En', 'Gobbi, Silvia', 'Brindle, Kevin M', 'Carrara, Maria']","['Barbera M', 'Kettunen MI', 'Caputo A', 'Hu DE', 'Gobbi S', 'Brindle KM', 'Carrara M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Anaesthesiology, University of Padova, 35131 Padova, Italy. mb584@hutchison-mrc.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Xanthones)', '0829J8133H (vadimezan)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Microcirculation/*drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Jan;34(1):273-9.,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we looked for putative target genes of cyclin A1 in hematopoietic cells. Microarray analysis of U937 myeloid cells overexpressing cyclin A1 versus conrol cells detected 35 differential expressed genes, 21 induced and 14 repressed ones upon cyclin A1 overexpression. Among the differentially expressed genes WT1 was chosen for further analysis. Repression of WT1 expression was confirmed on the mRNA and protein level. In addition, WT1 expression was higher in bone marrow, liver and ovary of cyclin A1-/- mice. Isoform analysis showed a profound change of the WT1 isoform ratio in U937 cyclin A1-overexpressing versus control cells. Functional analysis revealed an inhibition of colony growth when WT1 isoforms were transfected into U937 cells, which was not affected by the overexpression of cyclin A1. In addition, overexpression of the WT1-/+ isoform induced a G1 cell cycle arrest which was abrogated upon cotransfection with cyclin A1.

The alternatives to L-asparaginase are not available in many parts of the world, including Turkey. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the utility of premedication with or without a desensitization protocol in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions to Escherichia coli-asparaginase. METHODS: In this prospective study patients with systemic hypersensitivity reactions to E coli-asparaginase for whom we were unable to ascertain/provide other alternatives to asparaginase were either premedicated, desensitized, or both to receive their chemotherapy as E coli-asparaginase according to the severity of the hypersensitivity reaction. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (13 male patients) with a mean age of 7.4 +/- 4.7 years experienced a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to E coli-asparaginase during a 4-year period. Polyethylene glycol-asparaginase could be used for 3 patients. Eight of the remaining 16 children, who had experienced anaphylaxis, were premedicated and desensitized with E coli-asparaginase, and in 7 patients treatment was tolerated. The other 8 patients, with acute allergic reactions to E coli-asparaginase, were premedicated first, and 5 of them showed no reaction subsequently. Three of them demonstrated systemic hypersensitivity reactions again (anaphylaxis, n = 3), and premedication and desensitization with E coli-asparaginase resulted in anaphylaxis. Polyethylene glycol-asparaginase was administered uneventfully to the patients who could be provided it. CONCLUSION: E coli-asparaginase could be administered to more than half of the patients who had a hypersensitivity reaction, and all of these patients were able to receive their planned doses of asparaginase. In countries with shortages of alternative asparaginase preparations, our approach might be a suitable option.","['Soyer, Ozge Uysal', 'Aytac, Selin', 'Tuncer, Ayfer', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Yetgin, Sevgi', 'Sekerel, Bulent Enis']","['Soyer OU', 'Aytac S', 'Tuncer A', 'Cetin M', 'Yetgin S', 'Sekerel BE']","['Pediatric Allergy and Asthma Unit, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/04/23 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(08)01916-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2008.10.034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 Apr;123(4):895-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.10.034.

Based on the EST sequence zywb87 (GenBank accession number: CV973101) from a subtractive cDNA library of differential expressed genes constructed in familial AML, SMART-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (SMART-RACE) was applied to clone the full-length cDNA of the novel gene, and bioinformatics was used to predict its biological function, the expression of the novel gene in AML was detected by One-Step RT-PCR. RESULTS: A full-length cDNA of 2313 bp was obtained from the bone marrow specimen of the familial AML patient with complete open reading frame (ORF) of 249 bp.

METHODS: A panel of probes (LSI D13S319, LSI p53, LSI ATM, CEP 12, LSI MYB, and LSI IGHC/IGHV) and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to prospectively detect the cytogenetic abnormalities in 106 CLL patients, 82 males and 24 females, aged 62 (34 - 86). RESULTS: Molecular cytogenetic aberrations were found in 79 of the 106 CLL patients (74.5%) and 35 patients (33.0%) showed more than two kinds of abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality detected was del (13q14) in 48 cases (45.3%), followed by trisomy of chromosome 12 in 27 patients (25.5%), IgH translocation in 25 patients (23.6%), del (17p13) in 17 patients (16.0%), del (11q22) in 11 patients (10.5%) and del (6q23) in 5 patients (4.7%).

RESULTS: 15 patients were diagnosed as with aGVHD, and 29 with cGVHD. MMF was administrated as a first-line therapy drug in 19 patients and as a second-line therapy drug in 25 patients. For aGVHD the overall response rate was 80% with a complete response (CR) rate of 33.33% and a partial response (PR) rate of 46.66%. The response rates were 70% and 100% respectively for the first line and second line therapy. In 58.3% of the responsive patients the daily dose of PSE could be reduced.

In this study, we investigated prognostic factors and survival rate in adult patients with MDS refractory anaemia (MDS-RA) diagnosed according to French-American-British classification and evaluated the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for Chinese patients. METHODS: A multi-center study on diagnosis of MDS-RA was conducted to characterize the clinical features of Chinese MDS patients. The morphological criteria for the diagnosis of MDS-RA were first standardized. Clinical data of 307 MDS-RA patients collected from Shanghai, Suzhou and Beijing from 1995 to 2006 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve, log rank and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The median age of 307 MDS-RA cases was 52 years. The frequency of 2 or 3 lineage cytopenias was 85.6%. Abnormal karyotype occurred in 35.7% of 235 patients. There were 165 cases (70.2%) in the good IPSS cytogenetic subgroup, 44 cases (18.7%) intermediate and 26 cases (11.1%) poor. IPSS showed 20 (8.5%) categorized as low risk, 195 cases (83.0%) as intermediate-I risk and 20 cases (8.5%) as intermediate-II risk. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year survival rates were 90.8%, 85.7%, 82.9%, 74.9% and 71.2% respectively. Fifteen cases (4.9%) transformed to acute myeloid leukaemia (median time 15.9 months, range 3 - 102 months). Lower white blood cell count (< 1.5 x 10(9)/L), platelet count (< 30 x 10(9)/L) and cytogenetic abnormalities were independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis, but age (= 65 years), IPSS cytogenetic subgroup and IPSS risk subgroup were not independent prognostic factors associated with survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients were younger, and had lower incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities, more severe cytopenias but a more favourable prognosis than Western patients. The major prognostic factors were lower white blood cell count, lower platelet count and fewer abnormal karyotypes. The international prognostic scoring system risk group was not an independent prognostic factor for Chinese myelodysplastic syndrome patients with refractory anaemia patients.","['Wang, Xiao-qin', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Chen, Shu-chang', 'Lin, Guo-wei', 'Ji, Mei-rong', 'Liang, Jian-ying', 'Liu, Dun-dan', 'Li, De-gao', 'Ma, Yan']","['Wang XQ', 'Chen ZX', 'Chen SC', 'Lin GW', 'Ji MR', 'Liang JY', 'Liu DD', 'Li DG', 'Ma Y']","['Department of Haematology, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/*etiology/mortality', 'Asians', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/mortality', 'Prognosis']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2008 Sep 20;121(18):1787-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed fludarabine and cytarabine with transfusion of donor haematopoietic stem cell in treating the relapse of acute leukaemia after allo-HSCT. METHODS: Seven patients, median age 34 years, with relapse of acute leukaemia after allo-HSCT received combination chemotherapy of fludarabine with cytarabine for 5 days. Five patients suffered from acute myeloid leukaemia (2 refractory) and 2 refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. After the transplantation, the median relapse time was 110 days (range, 38 - 185 days). Two days after chemotherapy, 5 patients received infusion of donor's peripheral blood stem cells, mobilized by granulocyte colony stimulating factor. No prophylactic agents of graft versus host diseases were administered. RESULTS: Six patients achieved haematopoietic reconstitution. DNA sequence analysis at day 30 after treatment identified all as full donor chimera type. The median observation time was 189 days. After the treatment, the median time for neutrophilic granulocyte value = 0.5 x 10(9)/L and for platelet value = 20 x 10(9)/L were 13 days (range, 10 - 18 days) and 15 days (range, 11 - 24 days), respectively. Graft versus host disease occurred in 2 patients (acute) and 3 (chronic). Five patients suffered from pulmonary fungal infection (2 died), 3 haemorrhagic cystitis and 2 cytomegalovirus viraemia. The other patients died of leukaemia related deaths. Three patients with chronic graft versus host disease who had received donor peripheral blood stem cells reinfusion have survived for 375 days, 232 days and 195 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine with cytarabine plus the donor haematopoietic stem cell should be considered as an effective therapeutic regimen for relapse of acute leukaemia after allo-HSCT.

The aim of this study was to analyze the alloimmune aetiology in the pathogenesis of LOHC post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on the medical records of 11 patients with immune-related LOHC post allogeneic HSCT. The clinical characteristics, therapy, and outcomes of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The median time of onset was 42 days after HSCT (range 16-150 days) and the median duration of HC was 43 days (range 29-47 days). All patients presented with prolonged HC for more than 35 days. Nine patients with evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation did not respond to anti-viral therapy even with CMV clearance in the urine post-therapy. Eleven patients with refractory HC received a low dose of corticosteroids and all patients went into complete remission.

METHODS: The course of diagnosis and treatment in a case of FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha fusion gene negative CEL was reported. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the immunophenotype of the cells in peripheral blood and pleural fluid. Karyotype was analyzed with G-banding. The expression of FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha fusion gene was detected by RT-PCR technique. Routine pathological examination of the tissues from bone marrow, lung and spleen were performed. RESULT: A sixteen-year-old girl had severe anemia, fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and dominant hypereosinophilia lasting for 22 months. Trephine biopsy showed a hypercellular marrow with eosinophilic proliferation and moderate reticular fibrosis. Eosinophilic infiltration was found in lung and spleen and embolism was also found in spleen. She had a clonal chromosomal abnormality t(5;12)(q31;p13). The expression of FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha was negative. An abnormal clone of T cells expressing CD(3)(-), CD(4)(-), CD(8)(+) was found in peripheral blood and pleural fluid, in which the clonal T cell accounted for 5.43% and 1.66% of the total lymphocytes respectively. The patient was refractory to treatment with hydroxyurea, prednisone and interferon alpha. She had poor response to a combination of therapy with low dose cytosine arabinoside, mitoxantrone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and prednisone. She did not respond to imatinib and died of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: The present case fulfilled the WHO diagnostic criteria of FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha(-) CEL which did not respond to routine treatment and imatinib. Allogenic stem cell transplantation should be considered as early as possible in this case. It is noteworthy that clonal CD(3)(-), CD(4)(-), CD(8)(+)T-cell abnormality is related to the pathogenesis of CEL.","['Luo, Rong-mu', 'Wu, Shu-lan', 'Tong, Chun-rong', 'Qiu, Jing-ying', 'Wu, Ping', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Luo RM', 'Wu SL', 'Tong CR', 'Qiu JY', 'Wu P', 'Lu DP']","['The Third Department of Hematology, Beijing Dao Pei Hospital, Beijing 100049, China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Nov;47(11):919-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We transfected dendritic cells (DCs) with recombinant adenovirus (Ad) containing survivin gene and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene and tested the inducing effect of the transfected DCs on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to kill leukemic cells. METHODS: After derived from the peripheral, DCs was assayed by mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) tests. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release test was used to evaluate cytotoxicity of CTL. RESULTS: Expression of survivin in transfected DCs was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. GM-CSF expression was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In MLR assay, DCs coinfected with Ad-survivin and Ad-GM-CSF induced higher allogeneic lymphocyte reaction than control DCs at ratios of 1:5, 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100. DCs coinfected with Ad-survivin and Ad-GM-CSF had much higher activity of CTL to HL-60 cells than DCs infected with Ad-survivin only, Ad-GM-CSF only, or control DCs. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in lymphocyte supernatants containing DCs coinfected with Ad-survivin and Ad-GM-CSF were significantly higher than those in the control group. CONCLUSION: DCs coinfected with Ad-survivin and Ad-GM-CSF induce much higher anti-leukemic response in vitro than those infected with either factor. Therefore, adenovirus vectors containing survivin and GM-CSF genes may be promising vaccine candidates for leukemia therapy.","['Zhu, Xiong-peng', 'Chen, Zhi-zhe', 'Li, Chun-tuan', 'Lin, Xu', 'Zhuang, Jian-liang', 'Hu, Jian-da', 'Yang, Ting', 'Xu, Zheng-shu']","['Zhu XP', 'Chen ZZ', 'Li CT', 'Lin X', 'Zhuang JL', 'Hu JD', 'Yang T', 'Xu ZS']","['Department of Hematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, Fujiang 362000, China. xiongpengzhu@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology/ultrastructure', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2008 Nov 5;121(21):2180-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the induction of specific disease risk is dependent upon the nature of the environmental challenge and interactions between the susceptibility set by the altered epigenome and the environment throughout the life course.","['Burdge, Graham C', 'Lillycrop, Karen A', 'Jackson, Alan A']","['Burdge GC', 'Lillycrop KA', 'Jackson AA']","['Institute of Human Nutrition, Southampton General Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, UK. g.c.burdge@southampton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Nutr,The British journal of nutrition,0372547,,IM,"['Animals', 'Birth Weight', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fetal Development/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Metabolic Diseases/*embryology', 'Neoplasms/*embryology/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/*physiology', 'Risk Factors']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007114508145883 [pii]', '10.1017/S0007114508145883 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Nutr. 2009 Mar;101(5):619-30. doi: 10.1017/S0007114508145883.

One strategy to overcome STI571 resistance is to decrease the level/activity of Bcr-abl. We reported that disruption of the anti-apoptotic protein Survivin promoted STI571-induced apoptosis in Bcr-abl(+) K562 cells, through caspase-dependent Bcr-abl degradation. To investigate the utility of Survivin disruption in drug-resistant CML cells, we generated STI571-resistant K562 cells by long-term culture with STI571. In contrast to parental cells, where Survivin disruption enhances STI571-induced apoptosis, Survivin disruption in STI571-resistant cells failed to promote STI571-induced apoptosis; rather it protected cells from STI571 and other apoptosis-inducing compounds. Even though Survivin levels were similar in parental and STI571-resistant K562 cells, Survivin disruption in STI571-resistant cells increased telomerase activity, likely due to Bcr-abl/c-abl degradation. Our results indicate that emergence of STI571 resistance in Bcr-abl(+) K562 cells results from induction of additional pathways that circumvent STI571-responsiveness.","['Wang, Zhanxiang', 'Pelus, Louis M']","['Wang Z', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, and the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Cancer Ther,Cancer therapy,101174596,,,,2008/12/17 09:00,2008/12/17 09:01,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cancer Ther. 2008;6(B):603-610.,,,"['R01 HL069669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069669-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079654-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2600525,,,,,['NIHMS70570'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the quality of quantitative exposure assessment is a crucial aspect of HOS to be considered for QRA. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop guidelines for the evaluation of HOS for QRA and to apply these guidelines to case-control and cohort studies on the relation between exposure to benzene and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We developed a three-tiered framework specific for the evaluation of HOS for QRA and used it to evaluate HOS on the relation between exposure to benzene and AML. RESULTS: The developed framework consists of 20 evaluation criteria. A specific focus of the framework was on the quality of exposure assessment applied in HOS. Seven HOS on the relation of benzene and AML were eligible for evaluation. Of these studies, five were suitable for QRA and were ranked based on the quality of the study design, conduct, and reporting on the study. CONCLUSION: The developed guidelines facilitate a structured evaluation that is transparent in its application and harmonizes the evaluation of HOS for QRA. With the application of the guidelines, it was possible to identify studies suitable for QRA of benzene and AML and rank these studies based on their quality. Application of the guidelines in QRA will be a valuable addition to the assessment of the weight of evidence of HOS for QRA.","['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Heederik, Dick', 'Kromhout, Hans']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Vermeulen R', 'Heederik D', 'Kromhout H']","['Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Division Environmental Epidemiology, Utrecht University, Jenalaan 18d, Utrecht, the Netherlands. j.j.vlaanderen@uu.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', '*Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Risk Assessment/*methods']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/01/03 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.11530 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2008 Dec;116(12):1700-5. doi: 10.1289/ehp.11530.

Thirteen WT1 peptides sequences were synthesized with chemically modified amino acids (via fluorination and photo-reactive group additions) at MHC and T cell receptor binding positions. Certain new non-natural peptide analogs could stabilize MHC class I molecules better than the native sequences and were also able to elicit specific T-cell responses and sometimes cytotoxicity to leukemia cells. Two photo-reactive peptides, also modified with a biotin handle for pull-down studies, formed covalent interactions with MHC molecules on live cells and provided kinetic data showing the rapid clearance of the peptide-MHC complex. Despite ""infinite affinity"" provided by the covalent peptide bonding to the MHC, immunogenicity was not enhanced by these peptides because the peptide presentation on the surface was dominated by catabolism of the complex and only a small percentage of peptide molecules covalently bound to the MHC molecules.

Stat3 and c-Myc TFs are essential for maintaining mouse ES cell self-renewal. c-Myc, together with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, is a reprogramming factor. While previous studies have investigated core transcriptional circuitry in ES cells, other TF pathways that promote ES cell pluripotency have yet to be investigated. Therefore, to further understand ES cell transcriptional networks, we used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) to map Stat3 and c-Myc binding targets in ES cells. Our results show that Stat3 and c-Myc occupy a significant number of genes whose expression is highly enriched in ES cells. By comparing Stat3 and c-Myc target genes with gene expression data from undifferentiated ES cells and embryoid bodies (EBs), we found that Stat3 binds active and inactive genes in ES cells, while c-Myc binds predominantly active genes. Moreover, the transcriptional states of Stat3 and c-Myc targets are correlated with co-occupancy of pluripotency-related TFs, polycomb group proteins, and active and repressive histone modifications. We also provide evidence that Stat3 targets are differentially expressed in ES cells following removal of LIF, where culture of ES cells in the absence of LIF resulted in downregulation of Stat3 target genes enriched in ES cells, and upregulation of lineage specific Stat3 target genes. Altogether, we reveal transcriptional targets of two key pluripotency-related genes in ES cells--Stat3 and c-Myc, thus providing further insight into the ES cell transcriptional network.","['Kidder, Benjamin L', 'Yang, Jim', 'Palmer, Stephen']","['Kidder BL', 'Yang J', 'Palmer S']","['EMD Serono Research Institute, Inc., Rockland, Massachusetts, United States of America. benjamin.kidder@emdserono.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/24 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003932 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2008;3(12):e3932. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003932.

A novel fusion toxin treatment, diphtheria toxin GM-CSF (DT-GMCSF) has been shown to selectively eliminate leukemic repopulating cells that are critical for the formation of AML. We previously showed that DT-GMCSF treatment of U937 cells, an AML cell line, causes activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study we further investigate the mechanisms of cell death induced by DT-GMCSF and show that, in addition to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, DT-GMCSF also kills AML cells by simultaneously activating caspase-independent necroptosis. These mechanisms depend on the ability of the targeted toxin to inhibit protein synthesis, and are not affected by the receptor that is targeted or the mechanism through which protein synthesis is blocked. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that fusion toxin proteins may be effective for treating AML cells whether or not they are defective in apoptosis.","['Horita, Henrick', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Thorburn, Andrew']","['Horita H', 'Frankel AE', 'Thorburn A']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (necrostatin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/24 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003909 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2008;3(12):e3909. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003909.

Inhibition of NF-kappaB by suppressing the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway, for instance by knockdown of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (I kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex (IKK1, IKK2 and NEMO) triggers apoptosis in such cells. Here, we show that an MDS/AML model cell line exhibits a constitutive interaction, within the nucleus, of activated, S1981-phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) with NEMO. Inhibition of ATM with two distinct pharmacological inhibitors suppressed the activating autophosphorylation of ATM, blocked the interaction of ATM and NEMO, delocalized NEMO as well as another putative NF-kappaB activator, PIDD, from the nucleus, abolished the activating phosphorylation of the catalytic proteins of the IKK complex (IKK1/2 on serines 176/180), enhanced the expression of I kappaB alpha and caused the relocalization of NF-kappaB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by apoptosis. Knockdown of ATM with small-interfering RNAs had a similar effect that could not be enhanced by knockdown of NEMO, PIDD and the p65 NF-kappaB subunit, suggesting that an ATM inhibition/depletion truly induced apoptosis through inhibition of the NF-kappaB system. Pharmacological inhibition of ATM also induced the nucleocytoplasmic relocalization of p65 in malignant myeloblasts purified from patients with high-risk MDS or AML, correlating with the induction of apoptosis. Altogether, these results support the contention that constitutively active ATM accounts for the activation of NF-kappaB in high-risk MDS and AML.","['Grosjean-Raillard, J', 'Tailler, M', 'Ades, L', 'Perfettini, J-L', 'Fabre, C', 'Braun, T', 'De Botton, S', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kroemer, G']","['Grosjean-Raillard J', 'Tailler M', 'Ades L', 'Perfettini JL', 'Fabre C', 'Braun T', 'De Botton S', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM U848, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (IKBKG protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PIDD1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]']","['onc2008457 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.457 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Feb 26;28(8):1099-109. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.457.

The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning AlloSCT, more recently following an autologous SCT, has reduced the TRM to <20%, but there is an associated increased relapse risk. The use of donor lymphocyte infusions and novel biological agents (thalidomide, bortezomib), alone or together, can be effective in relapsed and even persistent disease post-AlloSCT. Thus, in pursuit of the putative graft-versus-myeloma effect, we need to consider the whole patient management pathway both preceding (depth of response to novel agents) and post-AlloSCT, to minimize the toxicity while harnessing the adoptive immunotherapy effect. This review sets out what we have learned to date from the clinical research studies in this area, examines concepts for improving the outcomes of AlloSCT and proposes a potential direction of clinical investigation to maximize the effect of AlloSCT in multiple myeloma.","['Cook, G', 'Bird, J M', 'Marks, D I']","['Cook G', 'Bird JM', 'Marks DI']","[""BMTU, St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, UK.

Although it has been clearly established that rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased risk of hematologic malignancies including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, the absolute risk of developing a hematologic malignancy is less than 1%. In rheumatoid arthritis patients with secondary Sjogren's syndrome, Felty's syndrome, or paraproteinemia, the risks for developing hematologic malignancy are likely to be even higher. These risks are balanced by reduced rates of gastrointestinal cancers. There are no conclusive data that link the FDA-approved second line therapeutic agents with the subsequent development of malignancy. However, the renal transplant experience suggests that immunosuppression alone increases the risk of subsequent malignancy. This should be a guiding principle when obtaining informed consent as well as in planning future therapeutic approaches to rheumatoid arthritis. Alkylating agents markedly increase the risk of leukemia and skin, bladder, and hematologic malignancies when used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.","['Cash, J M', 'Klippel, J H']","['Cash JM', 'Klippel JH']","['Department of Rheumatic and Immunologic Diseases/A50, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio (J.M.C); and National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (J.H.K.).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Rheumatol,Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,9518034,,,,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]']","['00124743-199502000-00005 [pii]', '10.1097/00124743-199502000-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Rheumatol. 1995 Feb;1(1):14-22. doi: 10.1097/00124743-199502000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although initial ALL cure rates have improved up to 80%, the prognosis of recurrent ALL remains dismal with event-free-survival (EFS) rates about 35%. In order to analyse a population-based cohort with uniform treatment of initial disease, we examined the outcome of children suffering from relapsed ALL in Austria for the past 20 years and the validity of the currently used prognostic factors (e.g. time to and site of relapse, immunophenotype). Furthermore, we compared survival rates after chemotherapy alone with those after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). All 896 patients who suffered from ALL in Austria between 1981 and 1999 were registered in a prospectively designed database and treated according to trials ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-Austria (A) 81, ALL-A 84 and ALL-BFM-A 86, 90 and 95. Of these, 203 (23%) suffered from recurrent disease. One-hundred-and-seventy-two patients (85%) achieved second complete remission. The probability of 10-year EFS for the total group was 34 +/- 3%. Clinical prognostic markers that independently influenced survival were time to relapse, site of relapse and the immunophenotype.

XAF1 expression was analysed by semi-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Methylation specific PCR was used to detect methylation status of XAF1 promoter CpG islands.

Untreated RPMI 8226 cell expresses two variants of XAF1 mRNA. Untreated XG-7 cell has no expression of XAF1. Hypermethylation of XAF1 promoter CpG islands was detected in both cell lines. Both cell lines express full-length XAF1 transcript after treated with 2.5 mumol/L 5-AZA for 72 h. Our studies demonstrated that 5-AZA exhibits anti-myeloma synergy with ATO.

Since 1990 purine analogs replaced IFNalpha because of higher rates of complete remission and an invariable disease recurrence after cessation of IFNalpha. However, there are only limited data about long-term maintenance treatment with IFNalpha and none about dose finding in this phase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients treated at our institution for HCL are included in this retrospective analysis. Forty (77%) patients received IFNalpha and 35 patients continue on long-term IFNalpha maintenance therapy. The initial dose of IFNalpha was 3 Mio IU three times per week and was tapered 6 months after initiation to doses as low as 3 Mio IU/12 wk. Dose adaptation was performed by repeated measurement of soluble Interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2R) together with peripheral blood values. RESULTS: The median follow-up of patients in the long-term IFNalpha group was 13.6 +/- 7.5 yr. Long-term IFNalpha was in general well tolerated and only in six (17%) patients the treatment had to be changed to purine analogs in the long-term IFNalpha group because of side effects. There are no deaths directly related to HCL. CONCLUSIONS: IFNalpha is still an effective and well tolerated therapeutic option. By repeated measurements of sIL2R together with the peripheral blood values, IFNalpha doses can be tapered to the minimal effective dose. The advantages and disadvantage of IFNalpha in regards to the standard treatment in HCL patients are discussed.","['Benz, Rudolf', 'Siciliano, Raffaele Daniele', 'Stussi, Georg', 'Fehr, Jorg']","['Benz R', 'Siciliano RD', 'Stussi G', 'Fehr J']","['Clinic for Haematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Munsterlingen, Munsterlingen, Switzerland. rudolf.benz@stgag.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/10 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1190 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01190.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Mar;82(3):194-200. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01190.x.

Furthermore, simaomicin alpha induced an increase in cellular caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation, indicating that simaomicin alpha promotes apoptosis. The retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation status of simaomicin alpha-treated cell lysate was lower than that of control cells, suggesting that the target molecule of simaomicin alpha is in a pathway upstream of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. In the course of evaluating polycyclic xanthone antibiotics structurally related to simaomicin alpha, we also found that cervinomycin A1 stimulated accumulation of treated cells in G(1) phase. These results indicate that the polycyclic xanthones, including simaomicin alpha and cervinomycin A1, may be candidate cancer chemotherapeutic agents.","['Koizumi, Yukio', 'Tomoda, Hiroshi', 'Kumagai, Ayako', 'Zhou, Xiao-ping', 'Koyota, Souichi', 'Sugiyama, Toshihiro']","['Koizumi Y', 'Tomoda H', 'Kumagai A', 'Zhou XP', 'Koyota S', 'Sugiyama T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Akita University School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '100157-22-0 (simaomicin alpha)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/12/17 09:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1033 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01033.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Feb;100(2):322-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01033.x.,10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01033.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this open-label, multicenter, phase II study, patients received SR29142 for 5 days, administered at either 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg per day. Chemotherapy was started 4-24 h after the first infusion of SR29142. The primary end-point was overall response rate, defined as the normalization of plasma uric acid to 7.5 mg/dL or less, from 48 h after the first infusion to 24 h after the last infusion of SR29142. SR29142-related adverse events including hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions were assessed. Overall, 50 patients received SR29142 at either 0.15 mg/kg per day (n = 25) or 0.20 mg/kg per day (n = 25) followed by chemotherapy. The overall response rate was 100.0% (95% confidence interval, 86.3-100.0%) with 0.15 mg/kg and 96.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.6-99.9%) with 0.20 mg/kg. Both dose levels of SR29142 were equally effective at reducing plasma uric acid levels. In six patients, seven drug-related adverse events of grade 1/2 occurred before chemotherapy. SR29142-related, hypersensitivity-associated reactions occurred in three patients, and rash, anorexia, application site pain and pyrexia occurred in one patient each; only five patients (10%) showed anti-SR29142 antibodies by day 29. In conclusion, SR29142 is effective at reducing plasma uric acid levels with a tolerable safety profile as a single agent both prior to chemotherapy and during treatment.","['Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Hamaguchi, Motohiro', 'Hotta, Tomomitsu', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Sasaki, Tsuneo', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Morishima, Yasuo']","['Ishizawa K', 'Ogura M', 'Hamaguchi M', 'Hotta T', 'Ohnishi K', 'Sasaki T', 'Sakamaki H', 'Yokoyama H', 'Harigae H', 'Morishima Y']","['Department of Rheumatology and Hematology, Tohoku University Hospital, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan. kishizaw@mail.tains.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urate Oxidase/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2008/12/17 09:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1047 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01047.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Feb;100(2):357-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01047.x.,10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01047.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00631579'],,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University Hospital. POPULATION: Healthy female volunteers attending a gynaecological outpatient clinic. METHODS: Endometrial secretion fluid and tissue sampling 5 days after a spontaneous ovulation assessed with ultrasound. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progesterone (P) receptor, Ki-67 expression and the Noyes criteria were used to date endometrial biopsies. In the endometrial fluid samples, glycodelin A (GdA), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and P levels were analysed, and protein content and electrophoresis patterns were determined. RESULTS: All data were correlated to estradiol (E2) and P serum concentrations. The dating according to histology and immunohistochemical staining patterns correlated significantly with GdA levels (r=0.376, P=0.048) in endometrial fluid samples as well with serum levels of E2 (r=0.568, P=0.001) and P (r=0.408, P=0.023). No correlation was observed between tissue dating and LIF levels and protein content in endometrial fluid samples. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of GdA in endometrial secretion samples may provide a less invasive method for assessing endometrial maturation in potential conception cycles without disrupting implantation.","['van der Gaast, M H', 'Macklon, N S', 'Beier-Hellwig, K', 'Krusche, C A', 'Fauser, B C J M', 'Beier, H M', 'Classen-Linke, I']","['van der Gaast MH', 'Macklon NS', 'Beier-Hellwig K', 'Krusche CA', 'Fauser BC', 'Beier HM', 'Classen-Linke I']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Division of Reproductive Medicine, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BJOG,BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,100935741,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycodelin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PAEP protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Body Fluids/chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Glycodelin', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/analysis', 'Progesterone/analysis/blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Progesterone/analysis']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']","['BJO2039 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.02039.x [doi]']",ppublish,BJOG. 2009 Jan;116(2):304-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.02039.x.,10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.02039.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A combination of both the cryoprotective agents (non-toxic and toxic) demonstrated better survival and recovery of ES cells than the DMSO used alone. Use of this CPA combination in the freezing media gave an optimum viability of more than 83 % in a slow freezing protocol. Trehalose showed a definite advantage over DMSO in terms of viability and intactness of ES cell colonies with evenly distributed morphology. There was no significant difference observed in the expression levels of cell surface markers like stage specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) between early and late passages after 60 days of post-thawing.

Loss of menin has potent impact on proliferation of endocrine and non-endocrine cells. However, until recently little has been known as to how menin regulates cell proliferation. Rapid research progress in the past several years suggests that menin represses proliferation of endocrine cells yet promotes proliferation in certain types of leukemia cells via interacting with various transcriptional regulators. Menin interacts with histone H3 methyltransferases such as MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) protein. Increasing evidence has linked the biological function of menin to epigenetic histone modifications, control of the pattern of gene expression, and regulation of cell proliferation in a cell type-specific manner. In light of these recent findings, an emerging model suggests that menin is a crucial regulator of histone modifiers by acting as a scaffold protein to coordinate gene transcription and cell proliferation in a cell context-dependent manner. This recent progress unravels the coordinating role of menin in epigenetics and regulation of cell cycle, providing novel insights into understanding regulation of beta cell functions and diabetes, as well as the development and therapy of endocrine tumors and leukemia.","['Wu, Xinjiang', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Wu X', 'Hua X']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Methyltransferases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/156652408786733702 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2008 Dec;8(8):805-15. doi: 10.2174/156652408786733702.,,,"['R01 CA113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100912-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113962-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100912-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113962-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2858577,,,,92,['NIHMS183824'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these reasons FLT3 soon appeared as a promising target for the therapeutic intervention for this severe and aggressive malignancy; the recent determination of the crystal structure of the autoinhibited form of FLT3 gave new trend for the design and the synthesis of potent inhibitors. Small molecules tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent one of the largest drug family currently targeted by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of cancer. Exciting examples of such molecules have reached advanced clinical trials and have been recently approved by FDA for the treatment of different solid or haematological tumors. Usually TK inhibitors share common features, namely two hydrophobic/aromatic regions bearing one or more hydrogen bonding substituents.

This translocation creates two new genes, BCR-ABL on the 22q- (Ph chromosome) and the reciprocal ABL-BCR on 9q-. The BCR-ABL gene encodes for a 210-kD protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity, which is crucial for malignant transformation in CML. The recognition of the BCR-ABL gene and corresponding protein led to the synthesis of small-molecule drugs, designed to interfere with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activation by competitive binding at the ATP-binding site. The first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), introduced into clinical practice in 1998, was imatinib mesylate. Imatinib became the first choice drug in chronic phase CML, because of its high efficacy, low toxicity and ability to maintain durable hematological and cytogenetic responses. However, approximately 20-25% of patients initially treated with imatinib will need alternative therapy, due to drug resistance, which is often caused by the appearance of clones expressing mutant forms of BCR-ABL. Second-generation TKIs have provided new therapeutic option for the patients resistant to imatinib. Dasatinib is the first, second-generation TKI, approved in the US and European Union for the treatment of CML patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance. This drug is a dual SRC-ABL kinase inhibitor, active in most clinically relevant BCR-ABL mutations, except highly resistant T315I. Other second-generation TKIs include nilotinib, bosutinib and INNO 406. Apart from TKIs, the promising group of molecules is inhibitors of Aurora family of serine-threonine kinases. One of these molecules, MK0457, has entered clinical trials, and initial reports indicate that this compound could be active in disease associated with T315I mutation. Thus, wide spectrum of new agents, with different mode of action, is currently in clinical development for CML. It is likely that combination therapy will be the best therapeutic strategy in the future.","['Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Gora-Tybor J', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-510 Lodz, Ciolkowskiego 2, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/092986708786848578 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2008;15(29):3036-51. doi: 10.2174/092986708786848578.,,,,,,,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular cause of CML is the fusion oncoprotein Bcr-Abl whose constitutive tyrosine-kinase (TK) activity maintains enhanced signaling through multiple signal transduction pathways and confers proliferative and survival advantage to CML cells. These effects can be largely suppressed by TK inhibitor Imatinib mesylate, currently the leading drug in CML treatment. However, Bcr-Abl contains also additional functional domains, in particular a DBL homology (DH) domain with guanine-exchange function (GEF) which can activate small GTPases of Rho family and a Src-homology3 (SH3) domain which recruits other proteins with GEF activity. Bcr-Abl affects among others the RhoA/ROCK/LIM/cofilin pathway that regulates the actin cytoskeleton assembly and thereby the cellular adhesion and migration. This review deals in detail with the known points of interference between Bcr-Abl and Rho kinase pathways and with the effects of Imatinib mesylate on Rho signaling and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) components.

We explored a sequential treatment strategy to allow safe delivery of active agents at full doses. Previously, we studied sequential therapy with fludarabine followed by cyclophosphamide (F-->C). In that study, cyclophosphamide consolidation improved the frequency of complete response (CR) four-fold. Subsequently, rituximab was added to this regimen (F-->C-->R). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six previously untreated CLL patients received therapy with fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 5 every 4 weeks for six cycles, followed by consolidation with cyclophosphamide 3,000 mg/m(2) administered every 3 weeks for three cycles, followed by consolidation with weekly rituximab 375 mg/m(2) for four cycles. Evaluation for minimal residual disease included flow cytometry and a highly sensitive clonotypic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The median age was 59 years (range, 37 to 71 years), 61% of patients had high-risk disease, and 58% had unmutated IgV(H) genes. RESULTS: There were 32 responses (89%), including 22 CRs (61%). Consolidation with cyclophosphamide improved responses in 13 patients (36%); nine patients (25%) further improved their response with rituximab. Twenty patients (56%) achieved flow cytometric CRs, and 12 patients (33%) achieved a molecular CR (PCR negative). Patients achieving molecular CRs had an excellent prognosis with a plateau in the response duration curve, and 90% remain in clinical CR at 5 years. For the entire group, 5-year survival rate is 71% compared with a rate of 48% with our prior F-->C regimen (P = .10).

However, grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported in 52% of cycles of treatment. The purpose of this trial was to maintain the high responses but reduce the toxicity of FCR by decreasing the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR-Lite). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a single arm study of FCR-Lite which includes maintenance rituximab in 50 untreated CLL patients. Patients were evaluated for response using both the 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCIWG) guidelines and the 2008 guidelines. Two thirds of patients were treated by community physicians. RESULTS: The median age was 58 years (range, 36 to 85 years); 20 patients had Rai stage 1, 22 had Rai stage 2, and eight had Rai stage 3 and 4. The OR and CR rates were 100% and 79%, respectively, using the 1996 NCIWG guidelines and 100% and 77% using the 2008 guidelines. Median duration of complete response was 22.3 months (range, 5.2 to 42.5 months) and none of the complete responders have relapsed. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was noted in 13% of the cycles of therapy. CONCLUSION: FCR-Lite is highly effective in previously untreated CLL patients. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was dramatically reduced compared to standard FCR and our data demonstrated FCR-Lite can be safely administered in the community setting.","['Foon, Kenneth A', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Land, Stephanie R', 'Marks, Stanley', 'Raptis, Anastasios', 'Pietragallo, Louis', 'Meisner, Dennis', 'Laman, Andrew', 'Sulecki, Mathew', 'Butchko, Allyson', 'Schaefer, Patricia', 'Lenzer, Diana', 'Tarhini, Ahmad']","['Foon KA', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Land SR', 'Marks S', 'Raptis A', 'Pietragallo L', 'Meisner D', 'Laman A', 'Sulecki M', 'Butchko A', 'Schaefer P', 'Lenzer D', 'Tarhini A']","['Department of Medicine and Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cancer Centers, PA, USA. kfoon@nvcancer.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.17.2619 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.2619 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 1;27(4):498-503. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.2619.

The differentiation-inducing transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is required for proper control of adipogenesis, glucose metabolism, granulocytic differentiation, and lung development. Studies investigating the function of this protein in hematopoietic malignancies as well as in lung and skin cancer have revealed numerous ways how tumor cells abrogate C/EBPalpha function. Genetic and global expression analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases identifies C/EBPalpha-deficient AML as a separate entity yielding novel classification schemes. In patients with a dysfunctional C/EBPalpha pathway, targeted therapies may overcome the block in differentiation, and in combination with conventional chemotherapy, may lead to complete eradication of the malignant clone. Overall, a better understanding of the mechanisms of how C/EBPalpha dysregulation participates in the neoplastic process has opened new gateways for differentiation biology research.","['Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Halmos, Balazs', 'Levantini, Elena', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Koschmieder S', 'Halmos B', 'Levantini E', 'Tenen DG']","['University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Respiratory System/cytology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.17.9812 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.9812 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 1;27(4):619-28. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.9812.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February 2002 to March 2008, 82 patients with APL were treated with a combination of ATRA plus ATO. The first cohort of 65 patients received ATRA and ATO (beginning on day 10 of ATRA). High-risk patients (WBCs >or= 10 x 10(9)/L) received GO on the first day. From July 2007, the second cohort of 17 patients received ATRA and ATO concomitantly on day 1. They also received GO on day 1, if high risk, and if their WBC increased to more than 30 x 10(9)/L during induction. Monitoring for PML-RARA fusion gene was conducted after induction and throughout consolidation and follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 74 patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one achieved CR without full platelet recovery after the induction, for a response rate of 92%. Seven patients died at a median of 4 days (range, 1 to 24 days) after inclusion in the study from disease-related complications. The median follow-up is 99 weeks (range, 2 to 282 weeks). Among the responding patients, three experienced relapse at 39, 52, and 53 weeks. Three patients died after being in CR for 14, 21, and 71 weeks, all from a second malignancy. The estimated 3-year survival rate is 85%. CONCLUSION: The combination of ATRA and ATO (with or without GO) as initial therapy for APL was effective and safe and can substitute chemotherapy-containing regimens.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Estey, Eli', 'Jones, Dan', 'Faderl, Stefan', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Fiorentino, Jackie', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Blamble, Deborah', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Wierda, William', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Ravandi F', 'Estey E', 'Jones D', 'Faderl S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Fiorentino J', 'Pierce S', 'Blamble D', 'Estrov Z', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Verstovsek S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Although mutations at amino acids 12, 13, or 61 account for the majority of oncogenic Ras variants, we hypothesized that less frequent mutations at alternate residues may account for disease in some patients with cancer of unexplained genetic etiology. To search for additional, novel RAS mutations, we sequenced all coding exons in NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS in 329 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 32 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients, and 96 healthy individuals. We detected 4 ""noncanonical"" point mutations in 7 patients: N-Ras(G60E), K-Ras(V14I), K-Ras(T74P), and K-Ras(A146T). All 4 Ras mutants exhibited oncogenic properties in comparison with wild-type Ras in biochemical and functional assays. The presence of transforming RAS mutations outside of positions 12, 13, and 61 reveals that alternate mechanisms of transformation by RAS may be overlooked in screens designed to detect only the most common RAS mutations.

Emerging evidence suggests that LGLL cells with a CD8(+)CD28(null) phenotype induce these clinical manifestations through direct destruction of normal tissue. Compared with CD8(+)CD28(null) T cells from healthy controls, CD8(+)CD28(null) T cells from LGLL patients have acquired the ability to directly lyse pulmonary artery endothelial cells and human synovial cells. Here, we show that LGLL cells from patients possess enhanced cytotoxic characteristics and express elevated levels of activating natural killer receptors as well as their signaling partners, DAP10 and DAP12. Moreover, downstream targets of DAP10 and DAP12 are constitutively activated in LGLL cells, and expression of dominant-negative DAP10 and DAP12 dramatically reduces their lytic capacity. These are the first results to show that activating NKR-ligand interactions play a critical role in initiating the DAP10 and DAP12 signaling events that lead to enhanced lytic potential of LGLL cells. Results shown suggest that inhibitors of DAP10 and DAP12 or other proteins involved in this signaling pathway will be attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of LGLL and other autoimmune diseases and syndromes.","['Chen, Xianghong', 'Bai, Fanqi', 'Sokol, Lubomir', 'Zhou, Junmin', 'Ren, Amy', 'Painter, Jeffrey S', 'Liu, Jinhong', 'Sallman, David A', 'Chen, Y Ann', 'Yoder, Jeffrey A', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Wei, Sheng']","['Chen X', 'Bai F', 'Sokol L', 'Zhou J', 'Ren A', 'Painter JS', 'Liu J', 'Sallman DA', 'Chen YA', 'Yoder JA', 'Djeu JY', 'Loughran TP', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Wei S']","['Immunology Program, H.

The NRR includes the 3 Lin12/Notch repeats and the juxtamembrane heterodimerization domain, the region of Notch1 most frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma (T-ALL). Here, we report the x-ray structure of the Notch1 NRR in its autoinhibited conformation. A key feature of the Notch1 structure that maintains its closed conformation is a conserved hydrophobic plug that sterically occludes the metalloprotease cleavage site. Crystal packing interactions involving a highly conserved, exposed face on the third Lin12/Notch repeat suggest that this site may normally be engaged in intermolecular or intramolecular protein-protein interactions. The majority of known T-ALL-associated point mutations map to residues in the hydrophobic interior of the Notch1 NRR. A novel mutation (H1545P), which alters a residue at the crystal-packing interface, leads to ligand-independent increases in signaling in reporter gene assays despite only mild destabilization of the NRR, suggesting that it releases the autoinhibitory clamp on the heterodimerization domain imposed by the Lin12/Notch repeats. The Notch1 NRR structure should facilitate a search for antibodies or compounds that stabilize the autoinhibited conformation.","['Gordon, Wendy R', 'Roy, Monideepa', 'Vardar-Ulu, Didem', 'Garfinkel, Megan', 'Mansour, Marc R', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Blacklow, Stephen C']","['Gordon WR', 'Roy M', 'Vardar-Ulu D', 'Garfinkel M', 'Mansour MR', 'Aster JC', 'Blacklow SC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Notch1/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39248-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-174748 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 30;113(18):4381-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174748.

Conventionally, copy number losses are identified using metaphase cytogenetics, whereas detection of UPD is accomplished by microsatellite and copy number analysis and as such, is not often used clinically. Recently, introduction of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays has allowed for the systematic and sensitive detection of UPD in hematologic malignancies and other cancers. In this study, we have applied 250K SNP array technology to detect previously cryptic chromosomal changes, particularly UPD, in a cohort of 301 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), overlap MDS/myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), MPD, and acute myeloid leukemia. We show that UPD is a common chromosomal defect in myeloid malignancies, particularly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; 48%) and MDS/MPD-unclassifiable (38%). Furthermore, we show that mapping minimally overlapping segmental UPD regions can help target the search for both known and unknown pathogenic mutations, including newly identified missense mutations in the proto-oncogene c-Cbl in 7 of 12 patients with UPD11q.

We investigated nonsynonymous SNPs, SNPs with potential functional effect, and tag SNPs in regulatory gene regions in a total of 172 genes involved in cancer biology. After adjustment for multiple testing, we found a strong association between CLL risk and six genetic variants: CCNH (rs2266690, V270A), APAF1 (rs17028658, 3'region), IL16 (rs4505265, first intron), CASP8 (rs1045485, D302H), NOS2A (rs2779251, promoter), and CCR7 (rs3136687, intron 1). We found association with CLL susceptibility and 22 haplotypes in APAF1, IL6, TNFRSF13B, IL16, CASP3, CCR7, LTA/TNF, BAX, BCL2, CXCL12, CASP10/CASP8, CASP1, CCL2, BAK1, and IL1A candidate genes. Finally, we evaluated using public data sets the potential functional effect on gene expression levels of the CLL associated genetic variants detected in regulatory regions. Minor alleles for APAF1 and IL16 were associated with lower mRNA levels; no expression differences were observed for CCR7, whereas NOS2A could not be assessed.

In this study, (2)H(2)O was administered to a clinically homogeneous cohort of nine stable, untreated CLL patients. CLL dynamics in blood and bone marrow were determined and compared with normal B-cell dynamics in blood from five healthy individuals who underwent a similar (2)H(2)O labeling protocol. Average CLL turnover rates (0.08-0.35% of the clone per day) were approximately 2-fold lower than average B-cell turnover rates from healthy individuals (0.34-0.89%), whereas the rate at which labeled CLL cells in blood disappeared (0.00-0.39% of B cells per day) was approximately 10-fold lower compared with labeled B cells from healthy individuals (1.57-4.24% per day). Leukemic cell turnover variables inversely correlated with the level of somatic hypermutation of the CLL clone (IgVH mutations). Although CLL cells in bone marrow had a higher level of label enrichment than CLL cells in blood, no difference between proliferation rates and proapoptotic and antiapoptotic profiles of CLL cells from these compartments was observed. These data suggest that, in stable disease, there is a biological relationship between the degree of somatic hypermutation of the CLL clone and its dynamics in vivo.

HMGA1 encodes the HMGA1a and HMGA1b protein isoforms, which function in regulating gene expression. To determine how HMGA1 leads to neoplastic transformation, we looked for genes regulated by HMGA1 using gene expression profile analysis. Here, we show that the STAT3 gene, which encodes the signaling molecule signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), is a critical downstream target of HMGA1a. STAT3 mRNA and protein are up-regulated in fibroblasts overexpressing HMGA1a and activated STAT3 recapitulates the transforming activity of HMGA1a in fibroblasts. HMGA1a also binds directly to a conserved region of the STAT3 promoter in vivo in human leukemia cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and activates transcription of the STAT3 promoter in transfection experiments. To determine if this pathway contributes to HMGA1-mediated transformation, we investigated STAT3 expression in our HMGA1a transgenic mice, all of which developed aggressive lymphoid malignancy. STAT3 expression was increased in the leukemia cells from our transgenics but not in control cells. Blocking STAT3 function induced apoptosis in the transgenic leukemia cells but not in controls. In primary human leukemia samples, there was a positive correlation between HMGA1a and STAT3 mRNA. Moreover, blocking STAT3 function in human leukemia or lymphoma cells led to decreased cellular motility and foci formation. Our results show that the HMGA1a-STAT3 axis is a potential Achilles heel that could be exploited therapeutically in hematopoietic and other malignancies overexpressing HMGA1a.","['Hillion, Joelle', 'Dhara, Surajit', 'Sumter, Takita Felder', 'Mukherjee, Mita', 'Di Cello, Francescopaolo', 'Belton, Amy', 'Turkson, James', 'Jaganathan, Souyma', 'Cheng, Linzhao', 'Ye, Zhaohui', 'Jove, Richard', 'Aplan, Peter', 'Lin, Ying-Wei', 'Wertzler, Kelsey', 'Reeves, Ray', 'Elbahlouh, Ossama', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Bhattacharya, Raka', 'Resar, Linda M S']","['Hillion J', 'Dhara S', 'Sumter TF', 'Mukherjee M', 'Di Cello F', 'Belton A', 'Turkson J', 'Jaganathan S', 'Cheng L', 'Ye Z', 'Jove R', 'Aplan P', 'Lin YW', 'Wertzler K', 'Reeves R', 'Elbahlouh O', 'Kowalski J', 'Bhattacharya R', 'Resar LM']","['Departments of Medicine, Hematology Division, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HMGA1a Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/01/16 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [medline]']","['68/24/10121 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2121 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Dec 15;68(24):10121-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2121.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2121 [doi],,"['T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA096888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106439-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA96888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128865-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA60441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2913892,,,,,['NIHMS220444'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among various factors, the tumor microenvironment is known to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival of many cancers. However, it remains unclear how the tumor microenvironment contributes to the increased survival of B-CLL cells. Therefore, we studied the influence of bone marrow stromal cell-induced hedgehog (Hh) signaling on the survival of B-CLL cells. Our results show that a Hh signaling inhibitor, cyclopamine, inhibits bone marrow stromal cell-induced survival of B-CLL cells, suggesting a role for Hh signaling in the survival of B-CLL cells. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of primary B-CLL cells (n = 48) indicates that the expression of Hh signaling molecules, such as GLI1, GLI2, SUFU, and BCL2, is significantly increased and correlates with disease progression of B-CLL patients with clinical outcome. In addition, SUFU and GLI1 transcripts, as determined by real-time PCR, are significantly overexpressed and correlate with adverse indicators of clinical outcome in B-CLL patients, such as cytogenetics or CD38 expression. Furthermore, selective down-regulation of GLI1 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (GLI1-ASO) results in decreased BCL2 expression and cell survival, suggesting that GLI1 may regulate BCL2 and, thereby, modulate cell survival in B-CLL. In addition, there was significantly increased apoptosis of B-CLL cells when cultured in the presence of GLI1-ASO and fludarabine. Together, these results reveal that Hh signaling is important in the pathogenesis of B-CLL and, hence, may be a potential therapeutic target.","['Hegde, Ganapati V', 'Peterson, Katie J', 'Emanuel, Katy', 'Mittal, Amit K', 'Joshi, Avadhut D', 'Dickinson, John D', 'Kollessery, Gayathri J', 'Bociek, Robert G', 'Bierman, Philip', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Hegde GV', 'Peterson KJ', 'Emanuel K', 'Mittal AK', 'Joshi AD', 'Dickinson JD', 'Kollessery GJ', 'Bociek RG', 'Bierman P', 'Vose JM', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6395, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DHH protein, human)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (IHH protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (SHH protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/03 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [medline]']","['6/12/1928 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0142 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Dec;6(12):1928-36. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0142.,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0142 [doi],,['P20 RR 016469/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to identify miRNAs potentially implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We detected an abnormal miRNA expression profile in mononuclear and CD34(+) cells from patients with CML compared with healthy controls. Of 157 miRNAs tested, hsa-miR-10a, hsa-miR-150, and hsa-miR-151 were down-regulated, whereas hsa-miR-96 was up-regulated in CML cells. Down-regulation of hsa-miR-10a was not dependent on BCR-ABL1 activity and contributed to the increased cell growth of CML cells. We identified the upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) as a potential target of hsa-miR-10a and showed that overexpression of USF2 also increases cell growth. The clinical relevance of these findings was shown in a group of 85 newly diagnosed patients with CML in which expression of hsa-miR-10a was down-regulated in 71% of the patients, whereas expression of USF2 was up-regulated in 60% of the CML patients, with overexpression of USF2 being significantly associated with decreased expression of hsa-miR-10a (P = 0.004).

Previously, we identified a hematopoiesis-restricted MiHA, designated LRH-1, which is presented by HLA-B7 and encoded by the P2X5 purinergic receptor gene. We found that P2X5 is significantly expressed in CD34(+) leukemic subpopulations from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Here, we demonstrate that LRH-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses are frequently induced in myeloid leukemia patients following donor lymphocyte infusions. Patients with high percentages of circulating LRH-1-specific CD8(+) T cells had no or only mild graft-versus-host disease. Functional analysis showed that LRH-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) isolated from 2 different patients efficiently target LRH-1-positive leukemic CD34(+) progenitor cells from both CML and AML patients, whereas mature CML cells are only marginally lysed due to down-regulation of P2X5. Furthermore, we observed that relative resistance to LRH-1 CTL-mediated cell death due to elevated levels of antiapoptotic XIAP could be overcome by IFN-gamma prestimulation and increased CTL-target ratios. These findings provide a rationale for use of LRH-1 as immunotherapeutic target antigen to treat residual or persisting myeloid malignancies after allogeneic SCT.","['Norde, Wieger J', 'Overes, Ingrid M', 'Maas, Frans', 'Fredrix, Hanny', 'Vos, Johanna C M', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'van der Voort, Robbert', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Schattenberg, Anton V', 'de Witte, Theo M', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Norde WJ', 'Overes IM', 'Maas F', 'Fredrix H', 'Vos JC', 'Kester MG', 'van der Voort R', 'Jedema I', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Schattenberg AV', 'de Witte TM', 'Dolstra H']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (P2RX5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X5)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X5', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37615-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-153825 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Mar 5;113(10):2312-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-04-153825.

However, the mechanism regulating colocalization of CLL and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross talk between CLL and NLCs, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after coculture with NLCs. NLC coculture induced high-level expression of B-cell maturation antigen and 2 chemoattractants (CCL3, CCL4) by CLL cells. CCL3/CCL4 induction in NLC cocultures correlated with ZAP-70 expression by CLL cells. High CCL3/CCL4 protein levels were found in CLL cocultures with NLCs, and CCL3/CCL4 induction was abrogated by R406, a Syk inhibitor, suggesting that NLCs induce these chemokines via B-cell receptor (BCR) activation. BCR triggering also caused robust CCL3/CCL4 protein secretion by CLL cells. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that this pathway plays a role in vivo. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of cross talk between CLL cells and their microenvironment, namely, the secretion of 2 T-cell chemokines in response to NLC coculture and BCR stimulation. Through these chemokines, CLL cells can recruit accessory cells and thereby actively create a supportive microenvironment.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Quiroga, Maite P', 'Hartmann, Elena', 'Burkle, Andrea', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Rosenwald, Andreas']","['Burger JA', 'Quiroga MP', 'Hartmann E', 'Burkle A', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Rosenwald A']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

We identified new mutations in addition to the known V617F and exon 12 mutations, which were the most common. Most of the novel mutations are located in the pseudokinase domain and therefore are expected to relieve the autoinhibitory function of this domain on JAK2 kinase activity. Our data suggest that molecular testing of JAK2 mutations should not be restricted to the V617F and exon 12 mutations, but perhaps should extend to most of the pseudokinase domain coding region as well.

In vitro voreloxin undergoes minimal cytochrome P450 (P450) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated metabolism, and in vivo excretion of unchanged voreloxin as the major species is consistent with the slow rate of metabolism observed in vitro. The objective of the present study was to examine the cross-species metabolic profile of voreloxin and to identify and characterize the metabolites formed in rats. We also investigated baculovirus-expressed human P450s and UGTs to determine which isoforms participated in voreloxin metabolism. Incubations using human, monkey, and rat liver microsomes showed monkey and rat metabolism is similar to human. Voreloxin and metabolites collected from plasma, bile, and urine from rats administered radiolabeled voreloxin were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Activity of metabolites was determined with authentic reference standards in cell-based cytotoxicity assays. The proposed structures of metabolites suggest that metabolic pathways for voreloxin include glucuronide conjugation, oxidation, N-dealkylation, and O-dealkylation.","['Evanchik, Marc J', 'Allen, Darin', 'Yoburn, Josh C', 'Silverman, Jeffrey A', 'Hoch, Ute']","['Evanchik MJ', 'Allen D', 'Yoburn JC', 'Silverman JA', 'Hoch U']","['Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA. evanchik.marc@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bile/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Naphthyridines/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Thiazoles/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/06/25 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [medline]']","['dmd.108.023432 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.108.023432 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2009 Mar;37(3):594-601. doi: 10.1124/dmd.108.023432.

Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho, contains an RGS homology (RH) domain and Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) domains and acts both as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and an effector for Galpha(13). However, the molecular mechanism of LARG activation upon Galpha(13) binding is not yet well understood. In this study, we analyzed the Galpha(13)-LARG interaction using cellular and biochemical methods, including a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The results obtained using various LARG fragments demonstrated that active Galpha(13) interacts with LARG through the RH domain, DH/PH domains, and C-terminal region. However, an alanine substitution at the RH domain contact position in Galpha(13) resulted in a large decrease in affinity. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that binding of Galpha(13) proceeds with a large negative heat capacity change (DeltaCp degrees ), accompanied by a positive entropy change (DeltaS degrees ). These results likely indicate that the binding of Galpha(13) with the RH domain triggers conformational rearrangements between Galpha(13) and LARG burying an exposed hydrophobic surface to create a large complementary interface, which facilitates complex formation through both GAP and effector interfaces, and activates the RhoGEF. We propose that LARG activation is regulated by an induced-fit mechanism through the GAP interface of Galpha(13).","['Suzuki, Nobuchika', 'Tsumoto, Kouhei', 'Hajicek, Nicole', 'Daigo, Kenji', 'Tokita, Reiko', 'Minami, Shiro', 'Kodama, Tatsuhiko', 'Hamakubo, Takao', 'Kozasa, Tohru']","['Suzuki N', 'Tsumoto K', 'Hajicek N', 'Daigo K', 'Tokita R', 'Minami S', 'Kodama T', 'Hamakubo T', 'Kozasa T']","['Laboratory of Systems Biology and Medicine, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 153-8904, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Thermodynamics']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)70959-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804073200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Feb 20;284(8):5000-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M804073200.

Both cellular and humoral immunity are impaired with qualitative and quantitative defects in B cells, T cells, NK cells, neutrophils and the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Virtually all patients have reduced immunoglobulin levels, even in early stages, and this is associated with an increased frequency and severity of infection. Although prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin may be of clinical benefit in selected patients, it does not reduce mortality and is certainly not cost-effective. Autoimmune complications occur in up to a quarter of CLL patients and predominantly target blood cells. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) is the most common manifestation; immune thrombocytopenia, pure red cell aplasia and autoimmune neutropenia are less common, while non-hematological autoimmunity is rare. The UK CLL4 trial is the largest prospective trial in CLL to examine the significance of both a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and AHA. The study confirmed the usefulness of the DAT in predicting the development of AHA or not, demonstrated that AHA occurred more frequently in patients receiving treatment with chlorambucil or fludarabine alone compared with the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and showed that a positive DAT and the development of AHA were poor prognostic markers. Management of CLL-associated autoimmunity rests on good supportive care and the use of immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids and cyclosporine. Splenectomy remains useful, and monoclonal antibodies (rituximab and alemtuzumab) have given promising results.","['Dearden, Claire']",['Dearden C'],"['Department of Haemato-Oncology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

A number of clinical parameters have been identified that are predictive of the clinical course. More recently, a number of molecular biomarkers, most notably cytogenetics by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status and expression of ZAP70, have been identified and verified as also providing prognostic information. The current challenge is to understand how we should use this new information in clinical practice and whether we should alter treatment based upon the detection of ""high-risk"" features. Over the past decade there has been considerable progress in development of more effective treatments for CLL, but current consensus is that treatment of CLL should be based upon the treatment of symptomatic disease.

In the absence of therapy or sometimes despite it, CML has a propensity to progress from a relatively well tolerated chronic phase to an almost uniformly fatal blast crisis phase. The discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome followed by identification of its BCR-ABL fusion gene product and the resultant constitutively active P210 BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, prompted the unraveling of the molecular pathogenesis of CML. Ground-breaking research demonstrating that BCR-ABL was necessary and sufficient to initiate chronic phase CML provided the rationale for targeted therapy. However, regardless of greatly reduced mortality rates with BCR-ABL targeted therapy, most patients harbor quiescent CML stem cells that may be a reservoir for disease progression to blast crisis. While the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of CML was first suggested over 30 years ago, only recently have the HSC and progenitor cell-specific effects of the molecular mutations that drive CML been investigated. This has provided the impetus for investigating the genetic and epigenetic events governing HSC and progenitor cell resistance to therapy and their role in disease progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that the acquired BCR-ABL mutation initiates chronic phase CML and results in aberrant stem cell differentiation and survival. This eventually leads to the production of an expanded progenitor population that aberrantly acquires self-renewal capacity resulting in leukemia stem cell (LSC) generation and blast crisis transformation. Therapeutic recalcitrance of blast crisis CML provides the rationale for targeting the molecular pathways that drive aberrant progenitor differentiation, survival and self-renewal earlier in disease before LSC predominate.","['Jamieson, Catriona H']",['Jamieson CH'],"['Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0820, USA. cjamieson@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The most common cause of imatinib resistance is the selection of leukemic clones with point mutations in the Abl kinase domain. These mutations lead to amino acid substitutions and prevent the appropriate binding of imatinib. Genomic amplification of BCR-ABL, modulation of drug efflux or influx transporters, and Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms also play important roles in the development of resistance. Persistent disease is another therapeutic challenge and may in part, be due to the inability of imatinib to eradicate primitive stem cell progenitors. A multitude of novel agents have been developed and have shown in vitro and in vivo efficacy in overcoming imatinib resistance.

We will also describe inhibitors acting on targets found in signaling pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl, such as the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, and targets without established links with Bcr-Abl.","['Melo, Junia V', 'Chuah, Charles']","['Melo JV', 'Chuah C']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical & Veterinary Science, Adelaide SA, Australia. junia.melo@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Fortunately, recent advances on a number of fronts have expanded the acceptable donor pool. With the use of high-resolution typing, HCT outcomes using unrelated donors matched at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 give results very similar to those expected with matched related donors. A single mismatch, as determined either by low- or high-resolution testing, results in modestly worse outcomes, with mismatches at B or C better tolerated than mismatches at A or DRB1. Initial results of umbilical cord blood transplantation for adults showed a clear association of cell dose and outcome, limiting the procedure to a minority of adults where cord bloods with at least 2.5 or 3x10(7) total nucleated cells/kg could be found. More recently, the use of double cord transplants has shown considerable promise, lowering the risk of graft rejection and possibly the risk of relapse as well. Haploidentical transplantation using T-cell-replete marrow and post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide, or T-cell-depleted peripheral blood and marrow containing high doses of CD34+ cells is under investigation.

In parallel to these important insights in the complexity of the genetic networks in AML, a variety of diverse new compounds is being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. These approaches aim to develop targeted treatment concepts that are based on interference with molecular genetic or epigenetic mechanisms.

With routine administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with chemotherapy in the early 1990s and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the late 1990s, cure can now be expected in the majority of both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients. ATRA with anthracycline-based chemotherapy for induction and consolidation followed by ATRA plus low-dose chemotherapy maintenance is currently the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients. Early institution of ATRA before the diagnosis is confirmed by genetics and aggressive blood product support are important to reduce induction mortality, which remains approximately 10% among patients entered on clinical trials, but is certainly higher when all patients are considered. The relapse rate among high-risk patients is approximately 20%, and new strategies include administration of intensified anthracyclines, intermediate- or high-dose ara-C in either induction or consolidation, or ATO as early consolidation. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis for such patients and those with relapsed disease may be important to prevent the development of extramedullary disease. New therapeutic strategies have focused on minimizing chemotherapy and administering ATRA plus ATO as initial therapy. Recent studies suggest that patients who are molecularly negative after intensive consolidation may not benefit from maintenance therapy. Most exciting is the combination of ATRA and ATO, given with minimal chemotherapy only for leukocytosis, which is a very effective new strategy for patients who are unable to tolerate anthracyclines or older adults and soon may replace conventional therapy for many patients. Patients with relapsed disease do well with ATO followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'Altman, Jessica K']","['Tallman MS', 'Altman JK']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

The degree of leukemia cytoreduction and MRD clearance is determined by the collective influence of multiple factors. Some of these variables are features of the leukemic cells, such as expression of genes that regulate their susceptibility to cytotoxic drugs and their propensity to undergo apoptosis. Gene profiles depend, in turn, on the cell of origin for leukemic transformation, the type of underlying genetic abnormalities and/or epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Another set of variables is related to the host, such as age and polymorphisms in genes that metabolize drugs, which together with pharmacologic variables, such as drug pharmacodynamics and drug interactions, influence treatment response. Finally, the bone marrow microenvironment where leukemic cells reside can participate in the generation of drug resistance. Altogether, these variables determine treatment outcome in each patient. Full knowledge of the molecular features associated with treatment response is required for precise leukemia prognostication and monitoring, and can provide clues to useful targets for novel therapies.","['Campana, Dario']",['Campana D'],"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. dario.campana@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Selected patients can be offered a second transplant procedure. Newer strategies to eliminate minimal residual disease and, in allogeneic HCT recipients, to augment the graft-versus-tumor effect are needed for patients who are at high risk for relapse after HCT. Second cancers after HCT include post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, hematologic malignancies and new solid cancers. The incidence of second solid cancers continues to rise without a plateau with increasing follow up of HCT survivors. Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia are almost exclusively seen in autologous HCT recipients while post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders complicate recipients of allogeneic HCT.

Curiosity about the etiology of the nocturnal aspects of the hemoglobinuria led the German physician Paul Strubing to develop the prescient hypothesis that the erythrocytes of PNH are abnormally sensitive to hemolysis when the plasma is acidified during sleep because of accumulation of carbon dioxide and lactic acid as a result of slowing of the circulation. Investigation of the intricate pathophysiology that underlies the abnormal sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes to hemolysis in acidified serum produced a number of remarkable scientific achievements that involved discovery of the alternative pathway of complement, identification of the membrane proteins that regulate complement, discovery of a novel mechanism for attachment of proteins to the cell surface, and identification of the genetic basis of the disease. These discoveries were made steadily over a period of more than 100 years, and each generation of physicians and scientists made important contributions to the field. The mysteries of PNH have been solved in a particularly satisfying way because the precision and orderliness of the solutions made clearly understandable what had seemed at the times prior to resolution to be problems of nearly insurmountable complexity. The history of PNH is an inspirational reminder of the elegant complexity of nature, the rewards of curiosity and the power and beauty of science.","['Parker, Charles J']",['Parker CJ'],"['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84148, USA. charles.parker@hsc.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

We found that a component of Dicer complex RDE-4 and a chromatin-related zinc finger protein ZFP-1, not implicated in endogenous RNAi, regulate overlapping sets of genes. Notably, genes a) up-regulated in the rde-4 and zfp-1 mutants and b) up-regulated in the lin-35(Rb) mutant, but not the down-regulated genes are highly represented in the set of genes with corresponding endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs). Our study suggests that endogenous siRNAs cooperate with chromatin factors, either C. elegans ortholog of acute lymphoblastic leukemia-1 (ALL-1)-fused gene from chromosome 10 (AF10), ZFP-1, or tumor suppressor Rb, to regulate overlapping sets of genes and predicts a large role for RNAi-based chromatin silencing in control of gene expression in C. elegans.","['Grishok, Alla', 'Hoersch, Sebastian', 'Sharp, Phillip A']","['Grishok A', 'Hoersch S', 'Sharp PA']","['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (RDE-4 protein, C elegans)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Mannosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.142 (chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/*genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, Helminth', 'Mannosyltransferases/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma/*genetics']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]']","['0810589105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0810589105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Dec 23;105(51):20386-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0810589105.

However, the molecular mechanisms of its cytotoxic activity have not yet been investigated. Here we report that exposure of the THP-1 human myeloid leukaemia cells to EA leads to the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 via a redox-dependent mechanism in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Accumulation of p53 and activation of caspase 3 were also seen. This was consistent with EA concentration-dependent accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein peaking after 4 h of stimulation with EA. Experiments with THP-1 cells, where the activity of ASK1 was blocked by transfection with the dominant-negative form of ASK1 demonstrated the importance of this enzyme for EA-dependent activation of caspase 3. Accumulated HIF-1alpha protein did not, however, promote EA-induced activation of caspase 3 or accumulation of p53. The experiments with p53 knockdown THP-1 cells demonstrated that this protein is not important for EA-induced activation of ASK1, caspase 3 or accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein. This is consistent with previous results indicating a reduced activity of p53 in THP-1 cells.","['Casely-Hayford, Maxwell A', 'Nicholas, Sally A', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Casely-Hayford MA', 'Nicholas SA', 'Sumbayev VV']","['Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (azinomycin epoxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Epoxy Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(08)01217-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2009 Jan 14;602(2-3):262-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.12.001.

Recently, we showed that chloroquine (CQ), an anti-malarial and anti-rheumatoid drug, displays a competitive mode of inhibition on sickle erythrocyte arginase. However, the effects of CQ and its analogue, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on erythroid differentiation leading to induced fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) production is unknown. In the present study, we obtained evidence of the anti-proliferative and differentiation effects of CQ and HCQ at pharmacologically attainable concentrations. This differentiation effect was linked to a dose-dependent inhibition of arginase activity and induced hemoglobinization, as Hb F synthesis was increased by 3.4- and 3.2-fold for CQ or HCQ, respectively. Treatment of K562 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 8-bromo-cAMP (Br-cAMP) failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of CQ or HCQ on arginase activity. Indeed, the combination of Br-cAMP with CQ in LPS-treated cells resulted in a significant enhancement of Hb F and total hemoglobin production. Further, we showed that CQ or HCQ maximally stimulated intracellular cGMP levels by 6.6- and 3.0-fold at 6 and 3h, respectively, as demonstrated by immunosorbent assay. However, co-treatment of K562 cells with CQ or HCQ in the presence of inhibitors of sGC-PKG-pathways reduced Hb F stimulation, suggesting the possible involvement of the sGC-PKG pathway. This is the first evidence demonstrating the capacity of anti-rheumatoid drugs to modulate the arginine-pathway and result in the enhancement of Hb F production, and thus may provide a paradigm for targeted therapy of hemoglobinopathies and other inflammation-related disorders.","['Iyamu, Efemwonkiekie', 'Perdew, Harrison', 'Woods, Gerald']","['Iyamu E', 'Perdew H', 'Woods G']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Mercy Hospital & Clinics, Kansas City, MO 64108, USA. eiyamu@cmh.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Arginase/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Chloroquine/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydroxychloroquine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/04/02 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(08)00826-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Mar 15;77(6):1021-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.11.016.

Although first thought to be constitutively active, increasing evidence demonstrates the existence of a wide variety of posttranslational modifications that regulate the activity of these enzymes. Here we show that upon induction of apoptosis the ubiquitin ligase Itch is processed by caspases both in vitro and ex vivo in cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The specific cleavage site was mapped to residue Asp240. Interestingly, cleavage of Itch by active caspases does not inhibit the catalytic activity of Itch, but results in the loss of an N-terminal Itch fragment that contains a negative regulatory region. Our data suggests that caspase-dependent Itch cleavage might be an important regulator of Itch at the endogenous level under both physiological and stressed conditions.","['Rossi, Mario', 'Inoue, Satoshi', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Knight, Richard A', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M', 'Melino, Gerry']","['Rossi M', 'Inoue S', 'Walewska R', 'Knight RA', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM', 'Melino G']","['Medical Research Council, Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (ITCH protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Panobinostat', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(08)02325-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.11.154 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Feb 13;379(3):659-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.11.154.

Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (s-ALL) was rarely reported previously but can be distinguished today from recurrent primary ALL by comparison of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangement. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) is much more common, and some cases actually may be second primary cancers. Treatment-related and host-related characteristics and their interactions have been identified as risk factors for s-AML. The most widely recognized treatment-related risk factors are alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors (epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines). The magnitude of the risk associated with these factors depends on several variables, including the administration schedule, concomitant medications, and host factors. A high cumulative dose of alkylating agents is well known to predispose to s-AML. The prevalence of alkylator-associated s-AML has diminished among pediatric oncology patients with the reduction of cumulative alkylator dose and limited use of the more leukemogenic alkylators. The best-documented topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated s-AML is s-AML associated with epipodophyllotoxins. The risk of s-AML in these cases is influenced by the schedule of drug administration and by interaction with other antineoplastic agents but is not consistently found to be related to cumulative dose. The unpredictable risk of s-AML after epipodophyllotoxin therapy may discourage the use of these agents, even in patients at a high risk of disease recurrence, although the benefit of recurrence prevention may outweigh the risk of s-AML. Studies in survivors of adult cancers suggest that, contrary to previous beliefs, the outcome of s-AML is not necessarily worse than that of de novo AML when adjusted for cytogenetic features. More studies are needed to confirm this finding in the pediatric patient population.","['Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Hijiya N', 'Ness KK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Hudson MM']","[""Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplant, Children's Memorial Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60614-3394, USA. nhijiya@childrensmemorial.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Risk Factors']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/11 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.23988 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Jan 1;115(1):23-35. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23988.,10.1002/cncr.23988 [doi],,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2767267,,,,99,['NIHMS135594'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

DNA was covalently attached onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) through amines of the DNA bases using N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) and N-(3-dimethylamion)propyl-N'-ethyl carbodiimidehydrochloride (EDC). The covalently immobilized single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) could selectively hybridize with its complementary DNA (cDNA) in solution to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) on the surface. A significant increase of the peak current for methylene blue upon the hybridization of immobilized ssDNA with cDNA in the solution was observed. This peak current change was used to monitor the recognition of CML DNA sequence. This electrochemical approach is sequence specific as indicated by the control experiments in which no peak current change was observed if a non-complementary DNA sequence was used. Factors, such as DNA target concentration and hybridization conditions determining the sensitivity of the electrochemical assay were investigated. Under optimal conditions, this sensor has a good calibration range between 1.25x10(-7) and 6.75x10(-7)M, with CML DNA sequence detection limit of 5.9x10(-8)M.","['Lin, Xin-Hua', 'Wu, Ping', 'Chen, Wei', 'Zhang, Ya-Feng', 'Xia, Xing-Hua']","['Lin XH', 'Wu P', 'Chen W', 'Zhang YF', 'Xia XH']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Faculty of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350004, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Talanta,Talanta,2984816R,,,,2007/04/30 00:00,2007/04/30 00:01,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/30 00:01 [medline]']","['S0039-9140(06)00740-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.talanta.2006.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Talanta. 2007 Apr 30;72(2):468-71. doi: 10.1016/j.talanta.2006.11.015.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six each of C3H/He mice-derived radiation-induced and spontaneously developed myelogenous leukemias were analyzed. Bone marrow cells from five each of 2- and 21-month-old mice were used to subtract nonleukemic information in the analysis. mRNAs from individual mice were analyzed separately using 45,101 gene chips followed by computational biological analysis. RESULTS: First, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to discriminate the gene expression profiles of individual mice with radiation-induced myelogenous leukemia from those of bone marrow cells from 2- or 21-month-old mice. Discriminant union genes for individual leukemias were then selected, which finally yielded 242 genes, among which six are radiation-related genes including Hus-1, Edf1a2, andVegf-c; 16 are apoptosis/cell-death-related genes, 13 are cell-cycle/cell-growth-related genes, and 50 are suppressor/promoter genes. PCA of these 242 genes consistently enabled the discrimination of the radiation-induced leukemias from the spontaneous leukemias. Second, the other components of the same PCA provided four different eigenvector clusters in an unsupervised manner representing four histopathological findings, with which the differential diagnosis in molecular taxonomy was significant as determined by analysis of variance of the global gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: Discriminant union genes in radiation-induced myelogenous leukemias against spontaneous myelogenous leukemias and age-matched nonleukemic bone marrow profilings generated by unsupervised computational analysis essentially represent probabilistic biomarkers for radiation-induced myelogenous leukemias, which may contribute to developing a model for risk of secondary carcinogenesis in patients treated by whole-body irradiation.","['Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Tsuboi, Isao', 'Kitada, Kunio', 'Igarashi, Katsuhide', 'Kodama, Yukio', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Yoshida, Kazuko', 'Dainiak, Nicholas', 'Inoue, Tohru']","['Hirabayashi Y', 'Tsuboi I', 'Kitada K', 'Igarashi K', 'Kodama Y', 'Kanno J', 'Yoshida K', 'Dainiak N', 'Inoue T']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Biological Safety and Research, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', 'X-Rays/*adverse effects']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00475-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Feb;37(2):195-205. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.10.006.

Our aims were to identify statistically unique miRNA profiles in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma for diagnosis and investigate their specific involvement in various cell biological processes in cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: Laser capture microdissection techniques and TaqMan miRNA assays for mature miRNAs were performed to assess the genomewide expression of miRNAs in 27 human ICCs, 10 normal cholangiocyte cells and 8 normal liver tissues precisely and quantitatively. Two selected miRNAs, mir-204 and mir-320, were introduced into cholangiocarcinoma cell lines to examine their effects on potential target genes, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, respectively. RESULTS: A cluster of 38 miRNAs was markedly distinguishable between tumor and normal tissues. At least two distinct clusters of tumor samples could be identified that were associated with the higher or lower expression levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Moreover, the exogenous expression of mir-320 or mir-204 could negatively regulate Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 expression and facilitate chemotherapeutic drug-triggered apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: miRNA expression profiles are closely associated with the biological and clinical behavior of ICC. The modulation of aberrantly expressed miRNAs might prove a promising therapeutic strategy.","['Chen, Lei', 'Yan, He-Xin', 'Yang, Wen', 'Hu, Liang', 'Yu, Le-Xin', 'Liu, Qiong', 'Li, Liang', 'Huang, Dan-Dan', 'Ding, Jin', 'Shen, Feng', 'Zhou, Wei-Ping', 'Wu, Meng-Chao', 'Wang, Hong-Yang']","['Chen L', 'Yan HX', 'Yang W', 'Hu L', 'Yu LX', 'Liu Q', 'Li L', 'Huang DD', 'Ding J', 'Shen F', 'Zhou WP', 'Wu MC', 'Wang HY']","['International Co-operation Laboratory on Signal Transduction, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Institute, Second Military Medical University, 200438 Shanghai, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (CA-19-9 Antigen)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Bile Duct Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'CA-19-9 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis', 'Microdissection', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis']",2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/18 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0168-8278(08)00710-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2008.09.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2009 Feb;50(2):358-69. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2008.09.015.
