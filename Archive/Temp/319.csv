Guidelines for use based on a multiinstitutional study.,347-54,"The demonstration of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in human lymphoproliferative processes with the use of DNA hybridization has gained great popularity as a sensitive laboratory adjunct to diagnostic hematopathology. The fact that nearly all B- or T-cell malignant lymphomas and leukemias have one or more rearranged antigen receptor genes provides a biologic basis for a diagnostic test. To formally analyze the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of human lymphoproliferative disease, the authors conducted a large, multiinstitutional study. Through a blinded, controlled approach, gene rearrangement analysis of 275 cases was shown to carry a high correlation with conventional phenotyping and histologic diagnosis, with only minor false-positive and false-negative rates. Significantly, no rearrangements were detected in normal lymphoid tissues or carcinomas, sarcomas, or melanomas. In a randomized study of 50 cases, laboratory results showed a high rate of interlaboratory agreement, regardless of the level of previous experience. Furthermore, the reproducibility of interpretation of data (Southern blot autoradiograms) of 192 cases showed high concordance among 11 observers from multiple laboratories. Based on these findings, the authors propose a set of guidelines for interpretation of gene rearrangement analysis that, if carefully followed, renders this a highly reproducible, safe, and accurate addition to the diagnostic regimen for human lymphoproliferative processes.","['Cossman, J', 'Zehnbauer, B', 'Garrett, C T', 'Smith, L J', 'Williams, M', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Hanson, L O', 'Love, J']","['Cossman J', 'Zehnbauer B', 'Garrett CT', 'Smith LJ', 'Williams M', 'Jaffe ES', 'Hanson LO', 'Love J']","['Department of Pathology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA Probes)']",IM,['Am J Clin Pathol. 1991 Sep;96(3):436-7.

The strength of this empirical finding as evidence of biological association in individual radiosensitivity for these two end points is studied here. The major factor complicating the interpretation of this finding as evidence of such an association is the degree of imprecision of the radiation dosimetry system used in assignment of radiation doses to the A-bomb survivors. Using models recently suggested for dealing with dosimetry errors in epidemiological analysis of the A-bomb survivor data, the sensitivity of the apparent association between leukemia mortality and severe epilation to the assumed level of dosimetry error is investigated.","['Neriishi, K', 'Stram, D O', 'Vaeth, M', 'Mizuno, S', 'Akiba, S']","['Neriishi K', 'Stram DO', 'Vaeth M', 'Mizuno S', 'Akiba S']","['Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hair Removal/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1991 Feb;125(2):206-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fetal liver hemopoietic cells were infected with a high titer of helper-free Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) and were used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Two weeks later, progenies of a single primitive hemopoietic stem cell carrying a specifically integrated A-MuLV proviral DNA could be detected in both colony-forming units in spleen and myeloid colony-forming cells in the bone marrow. Beginning at 3 weeks after transplantation, the recipients developed elevated leukocyte counts, splenomegaly, and increase of blast cells in the peripheral blood. Multiple clones of A-MuLV-infected cells were infused into each recipient. However, in the same animal, DNA extracted from various affected organs and from factor-independent lymphoid and myeloid immortalized cells all contained an identical, specifically integrated proviral genome. The A-MuLV-infected stem cells differentiated into various lineages of hemopoietic cells. Our data show that the expression of the v-abl oncogene in a primary lymphoid-myeloid hemopoietic stem cell directly initiates leukemogenesis by stimulating factor-independent growth. The monoclonal-type disease development seen in these animals may require the occurrence of an additional genetic event.","['Chung, S W', 'Wong, P M', 'Durkin, H', 'Wu, Y S', 'Petersen, J']","['Chung SW', 'Wong PM', 'Durkin H', 'Wu YS', 'Petersen J']","['Morse Institute of Molecular Genetics, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brooklyn, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells', '*Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.4.1585 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Feb 15;88(4):1585-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.4.1585.,['v-abl'],PMC51064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the relationship between the presence of anti-Tax antibody and the transmission of the viral infection, annual consecutive serum samples from married couples serologically discordant or concordant for HTLV-I were examined. These included 5 individuals whose spouses seroconverted during this 5-year follow-up study period. The samples were tested by a Western blot assay using a recombinant Tax protein as the antigen. The results showed that 24 of 32 (75%) men in the concordant couples (both husband and wife were HTLV-I carriers) had anti-Tax antibody, while only 5 of 18 (27.8%) men in the discordant couples (husband was carrier and wife was seronegative to HTLV-I) were positive for anti-Tax antibody (P = 0.0012). Furthermore, all spouses of the 5 seroconverters (4 women and 1 man) had anti-Tax antibody, while only 23 of 46 (50%) age-matched randomly selected HTLV-I carriers from the discordant-couple group had anti-Tax antibody. When the data were analyzed by gender, all husbands of the female seroconverters had anti-Tax antibodies, which was significantly higher than the prevalence of anti-Tax antibodies in men who did not transmit the virus to their spouses during the follow-up period (P = 0.017). In addition, antibody reactivity to other HTLV-I antigens (including Env gp46, transmembrane protein gp21, and Gag p19 and p24) were examined. The results indicated no significant differences between the prevalence of antibody reactivity to any of the antigens in the spouses of the seroconverters and the reference group.

The recessive dilute (d) coat colour mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of coat colour, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing hair shaft. Most dilute alleles (dilute-lethal) also produce a neurological defect, characterized by convulsions and opisthotonus, apparent at 8-10 days of age and continuing until the death of the animal at 2-3 weeks of age. The discovery that the original dilute allele (now termed dilute-viral or dV) is the result of the integration of an ecotropic murine leukaemia provirus has allowed the cloning of genomic DNA and in this study complementary DNA, from the dilute locus. The predicted dilute amino-acid sequence indicates that dilute encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a tail, or C-terminal, region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. Dilute transcripts are differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and are very abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and spinal ganglia. These results suggest an important role for the dilute gene product in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.","['Mercer, J A', 'Seperack, P K', 'Strobel, M C', 'Copeland, N G', 'Jenkins, N A']","['Mercer JA', 'Seperack PK', 'Strobel MC', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA']","['Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,['EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)'],IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Hair Color/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Myosins/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/02/21 00:00,1991/02/21 00:01,['1991/02/21 00:00'],"['1991/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/349709a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1991 Feb 21;349(6311):709-13. doi: 10.1038/349709a0.,,,,"['GENBANK/M31718', 'GENBANK/X52371', 'GENBANK/X52372', 'GENBANK/X56198', 'GENBANK/X56199', 'GENBANK/X57181', 'GENBANK/X57182', 'GENBANK/X57183', 'GENBANK/X57184', 'GENBANK/X57377']",['Nature 1991 Aug 8;352(6335):547'],,,,,,,,,,,

Infection with IL-7 retroviruses, but not with a control retrovirus, resulted in the conversion of the cells to IL-7 independence. The frequency at which this occurred, together with data on vector expression levels, indicated that secondary events were required for factor independence in this system. Southern analysis showed that the IL-7-dependent clones harbored unrearranged copies of the vector proviruses. The factor-independent cells produced variable quantities of IL-7 as measured by an IL-7-specific bioassay, and their proliferation could be substantially inhibited by a neutralizing antibody directed against IL-7, indicating that a classical autocrine-mechanism was responsible for their transformation. These IL-7-independent cells were tumorigenic, in contrast to the parental IL-7-dependent cells or those infected with a control vector. These results showed that IL-7 could participate in the malignant transformation of pre-B cells. However, neither of two Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed pre-B-cell lines expressed detectable IL-7 mRNA, at a level of sensitivity corresponding to less than one molecule of mRNA per cell. Moreover, the proliferation of the A-MuLV transformants was unaffected by addition of the IL-7 antisera under conditions in which parallel experiments with IL-7 virus-infected cells resulted in greater than 70% growth inhibition. Thus, transformation of pre-B cells by A-MuLV was not associated with a demonstrable autocrine loop of IL-7 synthesis. These results show that IL-7 can participate in the malignant transformation of pre-B cells and suggest studies aimed at assessing the role of autocrine production of IL-7 in the generation of human leukemias and lymphomas.","['Overell, R W', 'Clark, L', 'Lynch, D', 'Jerzy, R', 'Schmierer, A', 'Weisser, K E', 'Namen, A E', 'Goodwin, R G']","['Overell RW', 'Clark L', 'Lynch D', 'Jerzy R', 'Schmierer A', 'Weisser KE', 'Namen AE', 'Goodwin RG']","['Immunex Corporation, Seattle, Washington 98101.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Growth Substances', 'Interleukin-7/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.3.1590-1597.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Mar;11(3):1590-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.3.1590-1597.1991.,['v-abl'],PMC369450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I has a trans-acting transcriptional activator, p40tax, that is thought to be implicated in leukemogenesis through the activation of cellular enhancers. With a subline (JPX-9) of the human T-cell line Jurkat, in which p40tax is inducible, gp34 was shown to be of cellular origin and to be transcriptionally activated by p40tax. It was also demonstrated that two species of mRNA are generated from one copy of the gp34 gene and that these mRNAs encode the identical gp34 product and differ in the 3' untranslated region. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of gp34 showed that it lacks typical signal peptides; however, it has a hydrophobic stretch for membrane anchoring and four possible N-linked glycosylation sites at the carboxy-terminal portion, indicating that it belongs to the family of membrane proteins whose carboxy-terminal portion protrudes out of the cell. The gp34 gene displayed relatively delayed induction compared with other genes activated by p40tax. Taken together with the observation of the dependence of gp34 expression on HTLV-I p40tax, unlike other p40tax-dependent genes such as those for the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain and c-fos, which are expressed or induced under physiological conditions, we predict that the mechanism involved in the induction of gp34 expression by p40tax is distinct from and more intricate than those for the previously characterized genes.","['Miura, S', 'Ohtani, K', 'Numata, N', 'Niki, M', 'Ohbo, K', 'Ina, Y', 'Gojobori, T', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Tozawa, H', 'Nakamura, M']","['Miura S', 'Ohtani K', 'Numata N', 'Niki M', 'Ohbo K', 'Ina Y', 'Gojobori T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tozawa H', 'Nakamura M', 'et al.']","['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.3.1313-1325.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Mar;11(3):1313-25. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.3.1313-1325.1991.,,PMC369402,,"['GENBANK/D90224', 'GENBANK/M35697', 'GENBANK/M35698', 'GENBANK/M35699', 'GENBANK/M35700', 'GENBANK/M55285', 'GENBANK/M55286', 'GENBANK/M73693', 'GENBANK/M73694', 'GENBANK/M73695']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, selection for retrovirus expression in EC cells has identified mutations in Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) located in the tRNA primer-binding site (PBS) region which relieve the EC cell-specific repression. We have found that exchanging the M-MuLV proline PBS for a glutamine one in a recombinant virus permits expression in EC cells. By using the recombinant virus as a backbone, the EC cell-specific repressor-binding site (RBS) element has been mapped to M-MuLV nucleotides 147 to 174. The RBS does not require precise positioning downstream of the M-MuLV promoter and can function in either orientation and in an intron, indicating that the regulatory effect is probably at the DNA, rather than RNA, level. We also show that the RBS element can repress heterologous promoters from an upstream position. Our results indicate that the RBS acts as a silencer that its inhibitory effect is mediated by a trans-acting factor, and that the mechanism of action is probably at the level of transcription. Through in vitro binding assays we have identified a binding factor which specifically recognizes the wild-type RBS sequence (binding factor A). The binding characteristics of factor A suggest that it is a stem cell repressor which acts at the M-MuLV RBS. Our DNA-binding assays also have identified a unique binding factor (binding factor Hp) which specifically recognizes a hemimethylated form of the wild-type RBS. This factor may play a role in methylation mediated control of retrovirus expression in EC cells.","['Petersen, R', 'Kempler, G', 'Barklis, E']","['Petersen R', 'Kempler G', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Teratoma/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.3.1214-1221.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Mar;11(3):1214-21. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.3.1214-1221.1991.,,PMC369392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitantly with Ara-C treatment, growth inhibition and loss of clonogenic survival of KG-1 cells were observed. Whereas KG-1 cells displayed only barely detectable amounts of c-jun transcripts when cultured in the presence of serum, Ara-C at concentrations of 1 to 50 microM induced c-jun transcripts in a dose-dependent fashion. Time course studies showed that 10 microM Ara-C induced c-jun transcripts 6 hr after initiation of culture. Induction of c-jun mRNA was independent of de novo protein synthesis, because the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide failed to alter Ara-C-induced c-jun mRNA accumulation. Furthermore, cycloheximide did not induce c-jun transcripts, ruling out the possibility of posttranscriptional stabilization of c-jun mRNA by labile proteins, as has been previously reported for a variety of serum-inducible protooncogenes and early response genes. Moreover, nuclear run-on analysis disclosed that c-jun induction by Ara-C in KG-1 cells took place at a transcriptional level. Taken together, these findings indicate that c-jun mRNA, unlike its rapid (within minutes) induction by serum in fibroblasts, is induced by Ara-C in KG-1 cells following a much more prolonged time course and is regulated essentially at a transcriptional level.","['Henschler, R', 'Brennscheidt, U', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Herrmann, F']","['Henschler R', 'Brennscheidt U', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1991 Feb;39(2):171-6.,['c-jun'],,,,,['Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Jan;71(1):388.

We investigated the role of HTLV-I in the pathogenesis of this disease by studying viral expression in fresh uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of six patients of Caribbean origin with TSP/HAM. The PBMC genomic DNA of all the patients studied carried HTLV-I provirus, but viral expression was not detected by Northern (RNA) blot analysis of total cellular PBMC RNA. When the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique was used with primers specific for the tax-rex mRNA, all of the samples were positive for this viral mRNA species, regardless of the duration of the illness (range, 2 to 13 years). The splice junctions for the tax-rex mRNA described in cases of HTLV-I-induced adult T-cell leukemia (position 5183 of the envelope and position 7302 of the pX region) were identical in three TSP/HAM cases studied. To ascertain whether viral expression occurred at a low level in many cells or at a high level in a few permissive cells, we performed in situ hybridization on fresh PBMCs from two patients (2 and 7 years after clinical diagnosis), seeking HTLV-I RNA sequences. Our finding indicated that in vivo HTLV-I expression occurred at a high level in a few cells (1 of every 5,000 PBMCs) in both cases studied. The fact that cells of all six patients with TSP/HAM were positive for viral expression, regardless of the time lag from diagnosis, suggests that persistent expression of a viral product(s) may be pivotal in the pathogenesis of TSP/HAM.","['Gessain, A', 'Louie, A', 'Gout, O', 'Gallo, R C', 'Franchini, G']","['Gessain A', 'Louie A', 'Gout O', 'Gallo RC', 'Franchini G']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*blood/microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.3.1628-1633.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Mar;65(3):1628-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.3.1628-1633.1991.,,PMC239951,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of analogues of 6 and 13 were synthesized in order to determine the structure-activity relationship necessary for inhibition of the enzyme. Substitution of chlorine for fluorine in 6 (i.e. 44), addition of an extra chlorine to the 5'-vinyl position (i.e. 51 and 52), modification of the 2'-hydroxyl group to the deoxy (34 and 35) and arabino (36 and 37) nucleosides provided competitive inhibitors of SAH hydrolase. Nucleosides 6 and 13, as well as 5'-deoxy-5',5'-difluoroadenosine (14) proved to be time-dependent inhibitors of SAH hydrolase. All three compounds are postulated to inhibit through the potent electrophile derived from oxidation of the 3'-hydroxyl of 6 or 13 to the ketone (i.e. 3 and/or the E-isomer). Consistent with the proposed mechanism of inactivation of SAH hydrolase by 6, 13, and 14 was the observation that incubation of purified rat liver SAH hydrolase with 6 resulted in release of 1 equiv of fluoride ion (by 19F NMR) and incubation with 14 resulted in release of 2 equiv of fluoride ion. The general synthetic route developed for the synthesis of the title nucleosides utilized the fluoro Pummerer reaction for the introduction of fluorine into the requisite precursors.

The rate of conversion of starting compound (4a-d) to solvolysis product was essentially equal to the rate of halide ion release, suggesting that the aziridinium ion is a short-lived intermediate. 1H NMR and 31P NMR kinetics experiments performed in the absence and presence of trapping agent (dimethyldithiocarbamate) confirmed that the aziridinium ion was too short-lived to be observed via NMR.

Synthesis of TXA2 from arachidonic acid is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase and TX synthase. Activin A/EDF induced the latter TX synthase activity, whereas the cyclooxygenase activity was constitutively expressed. The induction of this enzyme activity was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that activin A/EDF induced de novo protein synthesis of TX synthase. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between the induction of TXA2 synthetic activity and erythroid differentiation in MEL cells, since the former is not an erythroid phenotype. We found 1) that the two responses to activin A/EDF were distinctly affected by the initial cell density; 2) that the dose-response curves for activin A/EDF were similar (ED50 = approximately 100 pM), whereas the time course of induction of TXA2 synthetic activity was much faster; and 3) that other erythroid differentiation inducers of MEL cells, namely dimethyl sulfoxide and hexamethylene bisacetamide, had little or no effect on TXA2 synthesis. These results indicate that activin A/EDF induces TXA2 synthetic activity independently of erythroid differentiation.","['Yamashita, T', 'Shimizu, T', 'Ogata, E']","['Yamashita T', 'Shimizu T', 'Ogata E']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 5.3.99.5 (Thromboxane-A Synthase)']",IM,,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Activins', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thromboxane A2/*metabolism', 'Thromboxane-A Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/02/25 00:00,1991/02/25 00:01,['1991/02/25 00:00'],"['1991/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)67877-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Feb 25;266(6):3888-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heparan sulfate occurred as proteoglycans, of which the cell-associated component was separated into urea-insoluble (UI) and urea-soluble (US) fractions. The UI proteoglycan consisted of a single homogeneous molecular species with an estimated Mr of 360,000 (C(UI)PG), whereas the US component was composed of two subfractions: a homogeneous species with an Mr of 280,000 (C(US)PGI) and a mixture of compounds with Mr values of less than 80,000 (C(US)PGII), which were isolated in yields of about 110, 340, and 80 micrograms of hexuronate (HexUA), respectively, from 1.37 g of an acetone powder prepared from 5.7 x 10(9) cells in the logarithmic phase of growth. The proteoglycan released into the medium (12 liters) was a single homogeneous species with an Mr of 320,000 (MPG) which was purified in a yield of 500 micrograms of hexuronate. The major, cell-associated proteoglycan, C(US)PGI, had very high contents of serine and glycine, accounting for approximately 80% of the total amino acids. This proteoglycan as well as the other two large proteoglycans, C(UI)PG and MPG, were highly resistant to degradation by various proteinases. These three proteoglycans, C(UI)PG, C(US)PGI, and MPG, had heparan sulfates with estimated Mr values of 32,000, 27,000, and 30,000. On the other hand, the Mr of the smaller proteoglycan, C(UI)PGII, was not significantly different before and after beta-elimination, indicating that it contains only a small peptide, if any. The heparan sulfate of this proteoglycan consisted of smaller and heterogeneous molecular species with Mr values of 26,000, 20,000, and 4,000. Digestion of these heparan sulfates with heparitinase I plus II resulted in almost complete depolymerization and gave six unsaturated disaccharides, delta HexUA-GlcNAc, delta HexUA-Glc-NAc(6-SO4), delta HexUA-GlcNSO3, delta HexUA-GlcNSO3 (6-SO4), delta HexUA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO3, and delta HexUA(2-SO4)-GlcNSO3(6-SO4). The relative amounts of these disaccharides generated from the individual heparan sulfates showed that an average ratio of sulfate residues to repeating disaccharide units of the C(US)PGII-derived heparan sulfate (0.97) was significantly higher than those of the other three large proteoglycan-derived glycosaminoglycans (0.54-0.70).","['Okayama, M', 'Oguri, K', 'Yoshida, K', 'Ohkita, T']","['Okayama M', 'Oguri K', 'Yoshida K', 'Ohkita T']","['Clinical Research Institute, National Nagoya Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitinases and Chondroitin Lyases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Chondroitinases and Chondroitin Lyases/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Heparitin Sulfate/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Proteoglycans/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/25 00:00,1991/02/25 00:01,['1991/02/25 00:00'],"['1991/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)67866-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Feb 25;266(6):3808-19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All were grafted after a total body irradiation-cytoxan conditioning regimen. Of these 180 patients, 126 were non-randomly assigned to single dose total body irradiation (STBI group) and, 54 to fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI group). With a median follow-up of 40 months, there is no statistically significant difference in the 5-year survival rate between the two groups (51% for the whole population). In a first step we demonstrate by multivariate analysis that total body irradiation fractionation can dramatically decrease the incidence of interstitial pneumonitis. However, a multivariate analysis of potent risk factors for relapse post-transplant strongly suggests that TBI fractionation is also linked to an increased relapse rate. So, a sparing effect of fractionation for lung tissue could be offset by a less effective leukemic stem cell kill. Those results from a retrospective, non-randomized, multi-institutional study clearly need additional clinical data, ideally from a randomized study.","['Socie, G', 'Devergie, A', 'Girinsky, T', 'Reiffers, J', 'Vernant, J P', 'Le Bourgeois, J P', 'Herve, P', 'Guyotat, D', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Rio, B']","['Socie G', 'Devergie A', 'Girinsky T', 'Reiffers J', 'Vernant JP', 'Le Bourgeois JP', 'Herve P', 'Guyotat D', 'Maraninchi D', 'Rio B', 'et al.']","['Departement des Radiations, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', '*Preoperative Care', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects/methods']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(91)90048-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(91)90048-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Mar;20(3):397-404. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(91)90048-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, these cyst fluids contain large amounts of tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI), which is also expressed in many other human tumors. In the present study we examined the production of TAT-I, TAT-2 and TATI in 9 established tumor-cell lines. TAT-2 was produced by 5 cell lines. Its concentration in the conditioned medium of COLO 205 colon adenocarcinoma cells, K-562 erythroleukemia cells and fibrosarcoma cell lines HT 1080, 8387 and A 9733 was 460 micrograms/l, 9.8 micrograms/l, 21 micrograms/l, 8.8 micrograms/l and 0.24 micrograms/l, respectively. TAT-I was detectable in the conditioned medium of COLO 205 and HT 1080 cells at concentrations of 64 micrograms/l and 0.5 micrograms/l, respectively. TATI was detected only in the media of COLO 205 cells at a concentration of 23 micrograms/l. TAT-2 zymogen was purified from the conditioned medium of COLO 205 and HT 1080 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography. According to its aminoterminal amino acid sequence, a molecular mass of 28 kDa by SDS-PAGE, elution pattern in ion-exchange chromatography and ability to be activated by enteropeptidase, the zymogen is identical to that previously isolated from cyst fluid of ovarian tumors. In addition, we found that TAT-2 secretion could be down-regulated by dexamethasone in HT 1080 cells but not in COLO 205 cells. The abundant production of TAT-2 isoenzyme in different cancer cell lines suggests that it could contribute to the increased proteolytic activity of many human tumors.","['Koivunen, E', 'Saksela, O', 'Itkonen, O', 'Osman, S', 'Huhtala, M L', 'Stenman, U H']","['Koivunen E', 'Saksela O', 'Itkonen O', 'Osman S', 'Huhtala ML', 'Stenman UH']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-08-8 (Trypsinogen)']",IM,,"['Carcinoma/*enzymology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fibrosarcoma/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Trypsinogen/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/20 00:00,1991/02/20 00:01,['1991/02/20 00:00'],"['1991/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910470419 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Feb 20;47(4):592-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910470419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 340 bp of the LTR U3 region, about 450 bp of the 5' region and about 280 bp of the 3' region of env were sequenced directly in DNAs amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 2 or 3 sets of primers for each region. Nucleotide insertions, deletions or point mutations were observed at 50 positions in these regions of about 1,000 nucleotides length. None of these changes was specific to either HAM or ATL, and some changes were observed in proviruses from both cases of HAM and ATL. Moreover, the sequences of proviruses isolated from pairs of cell lines established from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the 4 patients with HAM also had different sequences. These results indicate that the proviruses from HAM and ATL are indistinguishable in these sequenced regions, suggesting that these 2 diseases are caused by infection with genetically indistinguishable HTLV-I. Therefore, the reason why these two distinct diseases, HAM and ATL, develop in HTLV-I carriers may be based on a host factor(s) or some other factor(s) rather than variation in the virus itself.","['Kinoshita, T', 'Tsujimoto, A', 'Shimotohno, K']","['Kinoshita T', 'Tsujimoto A', 'Shimotohno K']","['Virology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,,"['Base Sequence', '*Genes, env', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*microbiology']",1991/02/20 00:00,1991/02/20 00:01,['1991/02/20 00:00'],"['1991/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910470403 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Feb 20;47(4):491-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910470403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL60 cells differentiate along different cell type lineages in response to a variety of compounds. The direction of differentiation is usually inducer-specific. However, the response of HL60 cells to sodium n-butyrate (NaB) is pleiotropic. NaB induces HL60 along the monocytic, neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic pathways. In this study we saw that physiologic concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) switched the direction of NaB-induced differentiation from monocytic to granulocytic. We showed previously (Breitman & He, Cancer Res 1990: 50: 6268-6273) that combinations of RA and NaB synergistically induce HL60 to cells that reduce nitroblue tetrazolium. The present study shows that this synergy was even greater if the parameter measured was mature granulocytes. Our results raise the possibility that the endogenous RA in the serum used to grow cells in culture may affect the direction of differentiation of HL60 cells induced by NaB. Furthermore, our results may provide additional rationale for the use of combinations of RA and NaB in the treatment of some leukemias.","['He, R Y', 'Breitman, T R']","['He RY', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Butyrates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/blood/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1991.tb00528.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1991 Feb;46(2):93-100. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1991.tb00528.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the morphologic parameters evaluated, peripheral blood basophilia and bicytopenia proved to be good discriminators between Ph1-positive and Ph1-negative cases. As a group, Ph1-negative cases were more heterogeneous and tended to have lower hemoglobin, WBC, platelet count and absolute eosinophilia. Chromosomal abnormalities other than Ph1 were seen only in the Ph1-positive cases.

In the present studies, we examined mechanisms of this response. After treatment with DMSO, GM-CSF delayed expression of some HL60 differentiation programs (CD11b expression), but not others (nitro blue tetrazolium dye reduction), and delayed the exit of cells from the cell cycle. In the presence of DMSO, GM-CSF but not granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increased expression of steady-state c-myc RNA. DMSO-treated HL60 cells expressing heterologous epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors also proliferated in response to EGF and showed increased c-myc expression. Nuclear transcription studies showed that GM-CSF did not alter c-myc transcription in DMSO-treated cells, and studies using actinomycin-D showed no increase in steady-state c-myc RNA half-life. These studies indicate that GM-CSF increases post-deterministic proliferation and alters the phenotype of differentiating HL60 cells, and post-transcriptional alterations in c-myc expression may be responsible for some of these changes.

To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of IFN-alpha on CML cell proliferation, we studied the effect of IFN-alpha on P210bcr/abl in K-562 cells. The phosphorylated level of P210bcr/abl was not altered by treatment with IFN-alpha alone despite its inhibiting cell proliferation. However, when K-562 cells were treated with either a low (5 x 10(2) U/ml) or high (10(4) U/ml) concentration of IFN-alpha in the presence of hemin, P210bcr/abl protein activity decreased through reduction of in vivo phosphorylation, but not through inhibition of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, hemoglobin content was increased by IFN-alpha at both low and high concentrations in tandem with hemin-induced erythroid differentiation and the change in P210bcr/abl. These results demonstrate that IFN-alpha synergises hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation as it reduces the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of P210bcr/abl in K-562 cells.","['Shibata, K', 'Nishimura, J', 'Takahira, H', 'Nawata, H']","['Shibata K', 'Nishimura J', 'Takahira H', 'Nawata H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Blast Crisis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Mar;19(3):161-5.,"['bcr', 'c-abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degradation manifests by ""pulverization"" of chromatin followed by coalescence of the fine granules and nuclear disintegration. Between 2 and 6 h of treatment, a loss of about 30-70% of DNA from S-phase nuclei is detected by flow cytometry. A 10-min pulse of CAM is adequate to trigger subsequent DNA degradation. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA from CAM-treated cells reveals a typical nucleosome core particles ""ladder,"" suggestive of preferential degradation of spacer DNA. Despite extensive loss of DNA and nuclear disintegration, the cell membrane of CAM-treated S-phase cells remains intact for several hours, excluding trypan blue or propidium iodide. Mitochondria, assayed for their ability to maintain a transmembrane potential (rhodamine 123 retention), as well as the lysosomal proton pump (probed by supravital uptake of acridine orange) also remain unchanged in these cells. G1 cells are refractory to CAM under these conditions. Synchronization of cells in S phase by aphidicolin increases the sensitivity of the whole cell population to CAM.

The present investigation was undertaken to establish the influence of intracellular glutathione level on methionine auxotrophy in different mouse cell lines. A non-transformed, methionine-independent fibroblast cell line with essential normal growth rate in methionine-deficient, homocysteine-supplemented medium (Met-Hcy+), showed only a slight initial lag and then the same growth as control when glutathione was reduced to less than 5% by the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Increasing cellular glutathione by cystamine in a completely methionine-dependent leukemia cell line did not stimulate the cells to proliferate in Met-Hcy+ medium. A partly methionine-dependent transformed fibroblast cell line with reduced capacity to proliferate in Met-Hcy+ medium showed increased growth potential when the cells were depleted of glutathione by a non-toxic concentration of BSO. An even higher growth potential of these cells in Met-Hcy+ medium was obtained by addition of a non-toxic concentration of cystamine, while only a transient increase of glutathione content was observed under these conditions. Both BSO and cystamine increased the fraction of protein-bound cysteine and homocysteine in the partly methionine-dependent cells. These metabolic alterations correlated with the increased ability of these cells to utilize homocysteine for growth. Our results suggest that methionine auxotrophy is a metabolic defect that is not related to the cellular glutathione status, but may be related to the intracellular distribution between free and protein-bound forms of other thiols as cysteine and homocysteine.","['Djurhuus, R', 'Svardal, A M', 'Mansoor, M A', 'Ueland, P M']","['Djurhuus R', 'Svardal AM', 'Mansoor MA', 'Ueland PM']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '5UX2SD1KE2 (Cysteamine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'D5H88XF24X (homocysteine thiolactone)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'R110LV8L02 (Cystamine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Cystamine/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cysteamine/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cysteine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Homocysteine/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology', 'Methionine/*pharmacology', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/12.2.241 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1991 Feb;12(2):241-7. doi: 10.1093/carcin/12.2.241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the NGF effect was seen in the presence of conditioned medium derived from a human T-cell line (Mo-CM) containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we examined interactions of purified NGF and recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) on granulocyte growth and differentiation. rhGM-CSF stimulated a dose-dependent increase in methylcellulose colony growth at concentrations between 0.1 U/mL and 10 U/mL, and in the presence of NGF at 500 ng/mL this effect was enhanced. The number of basophilic cell colony-forming units (CFU-Baso) and histamine-positive colonies increased synergistically when NGF was added to rhGM-CSF. Furthermore, because Mo-CM acts with sodium butyrate to promote basophilic differentiation of alkaline-passaged myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60, we also examined the interaction of NGF and Mo-CM or rhGM-CSF using this assay. In the presence of NGF, Mo-CM at concentrations of 0.5% to 20% vol/vol, and rhGM-CSF at concentrations of 0.1 U/mL to 100 U/mL synergistically increased histamine production by butyrate-induced, alkaline-passaged HL-60 cells; this was associated with the appearance of metachromatic, tryptase-negative, IgE receptor-positive cells. The effects of rhGM-CSF or Mo-CM were completely abrogated by a specific anti-rhGM-CSF neutralizing antibody in methylcellulose, with or without NGF; the NGF synergy with rhGM-CSF in the HL-60 assay was also inhibited by either anti-rhGM-CSF or anti-NGF antibody. These studies support the notion that differentiation in the basophilic lineage may be enhanced by NGF acting to increase the number of GM-CSF-responsive basophilic cell progenitors.","['Tsuda, T', 'Wong, D', 'Dolovich, J', 'Bienenstock, J', 'Marshall, J', 'Denburg, J A']","['Tsuda T', 'Wong D', 'Dolovich J', 'Bienenstock J', 'Marshall J', 'Denburg JA']","['Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Basophils/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84189-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Mar 1;77(5):971-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a posttreatment bone marrow specimen, which was interpreted as a regenerating bone marrow morphologically and which demonstrated a normal karyotype cytogenetically, trisomy X was found in 16 of 1,000 interphase cells. This finding indicated the presence of leukemic cells that were undetected by conventional morphologic and cytogenetic techniques (ie, minimal residual disease). Cytogenetic studies of a relapse specimen obtained after a sex-mismatched bone marrow transplant showed only a normal female karyotype in each of 40 metaphase cells, suggesting that the relapse occurred in donor cells. However, interphase analysis demonstrated trisomy X in more than 80% of interphase cells and indicated that the relapse was of the original clone and was not a transformation of donor cells. This case illustrates that interphase analysis can be useful as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis in the detection of minimal residual disease and in the analysis of interphase cells that are not accessible to routine cytogenetic methods. It also illustrates that previously reported instances of relapse of leukemia in donor cells could have been incorrect if supported by cytogenetic data alone.","['Anastasi, J', 'Thangavelu, M', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Hooberman, A L', 'Bian, M L', 'Larson, R A', 'Le Beau, M M']","['Anastasi J', 'Thangavelu M', 'Vardiman JW', 'Hooberman AL', 'Bian ML', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Trisomy', 'X Chromosome']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84204-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Mar 1;77(5):1087-91.,,,['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells from 58% of these patients showed a dose-related inhibition of DNA synthesis when incubated with compactin. Unexpectedly, cells from 18% of the patients were resistant to the inhibitory effects of compactin on DNA synthesis and responded to the HMG CoA reductase inhibition with an actual increase in the incorporation of 14C-labeled thymidine into DNA. Another 18% of the patients studied displayed both inhibition and stimulation of DNA synthesis in a biphasic response depending on the particular concentration of compactin used. The maximum enhanced rates of cellular DNA synthesis were observed with lower compactin concentrations (5 x 10(-7) mol/L) than were required for maximum inhibition of DNA synthesis (10(-5) mol/L). Leukemia cells displaying a stimulated response to compactin had a significantly lower baseline DNA synthetic rate than did cells that showed an inhibitory response of DNA synthesis to compactin. There was no correlation between these cells' varying DNA synthetic response to compactin and measures of baseline HMG CoA reductase activity or acetate conversion to cholesterol. Whereas the observation of cellular DNA synthesis stimulation by HMG CoA reductase inhibition has not been observed in other mammalian cells and seems paradoxical, explanations may emerge in light of our growing knowledge concerning the importance of isoprenylation for the function of certain cell regulatory proteins.","['Hohl, R J', 'Larson, R A', 'Mannickarottu, V', 'Yachnin, S']","['Hohl RJ', 'Larson RA', 'Mannickarottu V', 'Yachnin S']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '1UQM1K0W9X (mevastatin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)']",IM,,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lovastatin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84201-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Mar 1;77(5):1064-70.,,,['2T32 DK 07134/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This subgroup of children with Ph1/-7 ALL was comprised primarily of older males with early B-lineage ALL. Bone marrow specimens from six Ph1/-7 patients were studied further using the polymerase chain reaction and primers that flank the ALL, and chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoints to determine the molecular characteristic of the 9;22 translocation. Rearrangements were detected in RNA from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood cells of six patients, although four were in hematologic remission at the time of the analysis. Five cases showed the ALL breakpoint, while one child with Ph1/-7 showed the chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoint. The induction failure rate was much higher in this subgroup (31%) as compared with Ph1-negative cases, and the projected duration of event-free survival reflected the aggressive nature of this subgroup because no children are projected to remain in remission at 2 years. ALL with both the 9;22 translocation and -7 appears to represent a unique and previously undescribed subgroup of childhood ALL associated with a particularly adverse outcome.

Fifteen adult patients with various morphologic forms of acute leukemia were followed through one to four courses of chemotherapy. Oral saline rinse samples were obtained thrice weekly and prepared for enumeration in a hemocytometer. The oral granulocyte counts were compared with concurrent counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Phagocytic activity of the oral granulocytes was measured by the method of Smith and Rommel. The 15 patients were followed through 30 courses of chemotherapy and recovery. During each, there was a drug-induced decrease in marrow, blood, and oral granulocytes that was reversed when therapy was discontinued and bone marrow activity was restored. Phagocytic activity of the oral granulocytes was not perceptibly affected by the antileukemic drugs. Oral granulocyte counts provide a noninvasive method for monitoring the onset and recovery of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and granulocytopenia in patients with leukemia.","['Dreizen, S', 'Menkin, D J', 'Keating, M J', 'McCredie, K B', ""O'Neill, P A""]","['Dreizen S', 'Menkin DJ', 'Keating MJ', 'McCredie KB', ""O'Neill PA""]","['Department of Oral Oncology, University of Texas Dental Branch.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology",0376406,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Candida albicans', 'Female', 'Gingival Crevicular Fluid/cytology', 'Granulocytes/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth/cytology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0030-4220(91)90519-i [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol. 1991 Jan;71(1):45-9. doi: 10.1016/0030-4220(91)90519-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response, greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years, in comparison with 16% after 5 years. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03), but not age at therapy, had a significant influence on peak GH responses. The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years), but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose.

Cells grown in the absence of GM-CSF incorporated tritiated thymidine, and this was partially reversed by adding neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antibodies to the culture medium, suggesting that it was due, at least in part, to autocrine GM-CSF production. This was confirmed by immunopurification of a GM-CSF-like activity from cell supernatant of AML-193 cells grown in serum free medium in the absence of exogenous GM-CSF. When AML-193 cells were cultured with GM-CSF in combination with other cytokines, Interleukin-1 alpha and beta (IL-1 alpha and beta), Interleukin-3 (IL-3), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), none of them affected the concentration of GM-CSF required to induce 50% of maximum proliferation (D50). However, the maximum proliferation induced by GM-CSF alone was drastically decreased by IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha.

The association of + Ph and + 19 in patients with extramedullary T-cell blast crisis is an unusual finding as compared with reports in the literature and could be explained by geographic heterogeneity. The extra chromosomal abnormalities were almost absent in lymphoid blast crisis patients with blast phenotype of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) type. Discrepancies were noted in different tissues (bone marrow and lymph node) in patients with extramedullary blast crisis of both myeloid and lymphoid type.

Our two-step PCR method involved the use of ""nested primers"" in the second step and could detect one K562 cell diluted into 10(5) normal cells. Elaborate measures were taken to exclude false-positive and false-negative results. In nine patients whose blood and marrow were studied simultaneously the results were concordant (two positive and seven negative). Twenty-three patients transplanted in chronic phase (CP) with unmanipulated donor marrow were studied. Blood cells from nine of these patients were studied 3 to 6 months post-BMT and six were PCR positive; three were negative on subsequent studies. Blood cells from 18 patients studied between 8 months and 8 years post-BMT were all PCR negative. Nine patients transplanted in CP with T-cell-depleted marrow cells were studied. Blood from five was positive 3 to 24 months post-BMT; blood from five was negative 3 to 6 years post-BMT. Four patients no longer in first CP were studied after BMT with unmanipulated donor marrow. Blood from all four was positive 5 to 19 months post-BMT. Based on the known clinical results of transplant in these three cohorts we conclude that PCR may be positive within 6 months of BMT in patients who can expect long-lasting remission, whereas PCR positivity later after BMT may indicate that the probability of cure is reduced. Thus, the technique may prove useful for early assessment of new transplant protocols that might inadvertently increase the risk of relapse.","['Hughes, T P', 'Morgan, G J', 'Martiat, P', 'Goldman, J M']","['Hughes TP', 'Morgan GJ', 'Martiat P', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cell Separation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/surgery', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85332-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Feb 15;77(4):874-8.,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the vinblastine-resistant human lymphoblastic lymphoma cell line CEM-VBL, simultaneous incubation of DNR with Tmx 10 mumol/L or Tmx 50 mumol/L increased intracellular DNR fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner and demonstrated an uptake pattern similar to that seen with DNR and verapamil. Similar results were obtained in the vincristine-resistant human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60/RV+. Cellular retention of DNR was also measured in both cell lines and results suggested that continuous exposure of the cells to Tmx resulted in higher intracellular DNR content compared with cells resuspended in fresh medium. No effect of Tmx or verapamil was observed in the drug-sensitive parent cell lines CEM or HL-60. Clonogenic experiments were then performed to determine whether Tmx was itself inhibitory to cell growth or whether Tmx potentiated DNR cytotoxicity. Tmx 10 mumol/L did not significantly inhibit either CEM-VBL or HL-60/RV+ cells after a 3-hour exposure followed by culture in methylcellulose. Tmx 50 mumol/L was significantly more inhibitory in both cell lines. However, cells that had been incubated with DNR and Tmx 10 mumol/L demonstrated a marked increment in growth inhibition compared with cells that had been incubated with DNR alone or Tmx 10 mumol/L alone.

GM-CSF was started 48 or 24 hours before chemotherapy (prephase) in 14 pts. In four pts with high white blood cell counts (WBC) rhGM-CSF was started after chemotherapy-induced cell reduction (WBC less than 30,000/mm3). During prephase GM-CSF induced an increase in neutrophil and blast cell counts in 13 of 14 and 10 of 14 pts, respectively. In vivo recruitment of leukemic cells into drug-sensitive phases of the cell cycle could be demonstrated by multiparameter cell-cycle analyses in peripheral blood (n = 7) and bone marrow (n = 4) specimens. On day 14, complete aplasia was evident in 17 of 18 pts. GM-CSF was administered until recovery from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (absolute neutrophil counts, [ANC] greater than 500/mm3). Fifteen pts (83%) achieved complete remission, 12 did so with one cycle. A shorter duration of neutropenia was evident in these pts compared with historical controls (n = 39), (ANC greater than 500/mm3, day 22.5 +/- 3.4 v 25.2 +/- 3.7, P less than .05). Three pts achieved complete remission after a second cycle (same combination of rhGM-CSF and 3 + 7). Two pts died during bone marrow aplasia because of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Clinical side effects possibly related to GM-CSF, mainly fever, diarrhea, and weight gain were mild and tolerable (World Health Organization toxicity grade less than or equal to 2). Together, rhGM-CSF recruits kinetically quiescient AML cells in vivo to enter drug-sensitive phases of the cell cycle and promotes early myeloid recovery from aplasia after exposure to standard induction chemotherapy for AML.","['Bettelheim, P', 'Valent, P', 'Andreeff, M', 'Tafuri, A', 'Haimi, J', 'Gorischek, C', 'Muhm, M', 'Sillaber, C', 'Haas, O', 'Vieder, L']","['Bettelheim P', 'Valent P', 'Andreeff M', 'Tafuri A', 'Haimi J', 'Gorischek C', 'Muhm M', 'Sillaber C', 'Haas O', 'Vieder L', 'et al.']","['First Medicine Department, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85309-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Feb 15;77(4):700-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DDATHF analogues in which the phenyl ring was replaced either by a cyclohexyl ring or by methylene groups retained activity as inhibitors. 5,10-Dideazatetrahydrohomofolate was about 6 times more potent as an inhibitor of GARFT than DDATHF, but 5,10-dideazatetrahydronorfolate had about one-fifth of the activity of DDATHF. An analogue of DDATHF in which the glutamic acid side chain was replaced by aspartic acid (which was not a substrate for polyglutamation and was only weakly cytotoxic) was equiactive with DDATHF as an inhibitor of purified GARFT. Surprisingly, 5,10-dideazatetrahydropteroic acid was about as active as DDATHF as an inhibitor of GARFT, an indication that the glutamic acid in the side chain of DDATHF does not play a role in this ligand-enzyme interaction. The polyglutamate derivatives of DDATHF bound up to 100 times tighter to GARFT than DDATHF itself; longer chain polyglutamates conformed to Goldstein's zone B behavior under experimental conditions and were projected to be in zone C, i.e., stoichiometric inhibition, in vivo. We conclude that the presence of carbon at the 5-position of tetrahydrofolate analogues is sufficient for inhibition of GARFT, that N-8 and the 2-amino group are involved in binding of DDATHF to GARFT, probably through hydrogen bonds, and that the structures of the phenyl ring and amino acid side chain of DDATHF analogues are not primary determinants of GARFT inhibition by monoglutamate forms of these compounds. We also conclude that polyglutamation plays a major role in the potent cytotoxicity of DDATHF.","['Baldwin, S W', 'Tse, A', 'Gossett, L S', 'Taylor, E C', 'Rosowsky, A', 'Shih, C', 'Moran, R G']","['Baldwin SW', 'Tse A', 'Gossett LS', 'Taylor EC', 'Rosowsky A', 'Shih C', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)']",IM,,"['Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology']",1991/02/19 00:00,1991/02/19 00:01,['1991/02/19 00:00'],"['1991/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00221a037 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1991 Feb 19;30(7):1997-2006. doi: 10.1021/bi00221a037.,,,"['CA-27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The H2B protein coding region of HHC289 is flanked at the 3' end by a 1798-nt nontranslated trailer that contains a region of hyphenated dyad symmetry and a poly(A) addition sequence, followed by a poly(A) tail. Nuclear run-on transcription analysis revealed a 2-fold increase in transcription of the HHC289 gene during S phase, in comparison to replication-dependent human histone genes which exhibit a 2-3-fold increase in transcription during S phase. Northern blot analysis indicated that the levels of the 2300-nt HHC289 mRNA species did not vary significantly during the HeLa S3 cell cycle, in comparison to replication-dependent H2B mRNAs which are elevated 15-fold during S phase. Northern blot analysis also revealed a reciprocal relationship during the onset of HL60 differentiation between the expression of the HHC289 H2B gene and the replication-dependent H2B genes. The levels of the 2300-nt HHC289 H2B species increased approximately 10-fold during HL60 cell differentiation whereas the levels of cell cycle dependent H2B mRNAs decreased to less than 1% of those in proliferating cells. These results suggest that complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms control cellular levels of mRNAs from various human H2B histone genes during progression through the cell cycle and at the onset of differentiation.","['Collart, D', 'Ramsey-Ewing, A', 'Bortell, R', 'Lian, J', 'Stein, J', 'Stein, G']","['Collart D', 'Ramsey-Ewing A', 'Bortell R', 'Lian J', 'Stein J', 'Stein G']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Library', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification', 'S Phase', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/02/12 00:00,1991/02/12 00:01,['1991/02/12 00:00'],"['1991/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00220a024 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1991 Feb 12;30(6):1610-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00220a024.,,,"['GM 32010/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 32381/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/J05322', 'GENBANK/M58643', 'GENBANK/M58644', 'GENBANK/M58645', 'GENBANK/M58646', 'GENBANK/M58647', 'GENBANK/M58648', 'GENBANK/M58649', 'GENBANK/M58650', 'GENBANK/M60756', 'GENBANK/S62774']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Industry-specific proportional cancer incidence ratios (PCIR) were calculated by race and sex for all individuals and for white males with blue-collar occupations. Expected numbers of cancers were derived both from cancers occurring among all occupations and just among blue-collar occupations. This latter analysis was done as a control for differences in the prevalence of life-style habits between blue- and white-collar workers. Increased lung cancer PCIR were seen in most industries previously reported to be associated with lung cancer risk. The effects of socioeconomic status on these results are discussed. Other results include an increased ratio of melanoma in blue-collar white male rubber and plastic product workers, an increased ratio of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in motor vehicle manufacture workers, and an increased PCIR of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in general construction workers.

To localize molecular markers flanking the t(11;22) (q24;q12) breakpoint that occurs in virtually all cases of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, high-resolution chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization was carried out using a panel of cosmid clones localized and ordered on chromosome 11q. The location of the Ewing sarcoma translocation breakpoint was determined relative to the nearest two cosmid markers on 11q, clones 23.2 and 5.8, through the analysis of metaphase chromosome hybridization. By in situ hybridization to interphase nuclei, the approximate physical separation of these two markers was determined. In both Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, cosmid clone 5.8 is translocated from chromosome 11q24 to the derivative chromosome 22 and a portion of chromosome 22q12 carrying the leukemia inhibitory factor gene is translocated to the derivative chromosome 11. The physical distance between the flanking cosmid markers on chromosome 11 was determined to be in the range of 1000 kilobases, and genomic analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed no abnormalities over a region of 650 kilobases in the vicinity of the leukemia inhibitory factor gene on chromosome 22. This approach localizes the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint to a small region on chromosome 11q24 and provides a rapid and precise technique for the molecular characterization of chromosomal aberrations.","['Selleri, L', 'Hermanson, G G', 'Eubanks, J H', 'Lewis, K A', 'Evans, G A']","['Selleri L', 'Hermanson GG', 'Eubanks JH', 'Lewis KA', 'Evans GA']","['Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Cosmids', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Metaphase', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', '*Suppression, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.3.887 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Feb 1;88(3):887-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.3.887.,,PMC50919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key step in each preparation was the condensation of the appropriate chroman-, thiochroman-, or benzothienyl-substituted phosphorus ylide, obtained from the independent synthesis of the corresponding phosphonium salts, with selected polyene-substituted aldehyde esters. Nine of these heterocycles contained a thiochroman group, two had a chroman group, and two others had a benzothienyl system. Screening of the compounds was with one of two assays. One assay measured the ability of a retinoid to inhibit the phorbol ester induced increase of mouse epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. The other assay measured retinoid-induced differentiation of the human myoloid leukemia cell line HL-60. In the ODC assay, all thirteen compounds were screened. The most active heteroarotinoids were ester 10 [methyl (E)-4-[2-(2,2,4,4-tetramethylthiochroman-6-yl)-1- propenyl]benzoate] and acid 11 [(E)-4-[2-(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3,4- dihydro-2H-1- benzothiopyran-6-yl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid]. Both of these retinoids had ID50 values (dose required for half-maximal inhibition of phorbol ester induced ODC activity) of about 0.3 nmol. In comparison, the ID50 value for trans-retinoic acid (1) was 0.12 nmol while the ID50 values for acids 7 and 9, namely (2Z,4E,6E)-3,7-dimethyl-7-(4,4-dimethyl-thiochroman -6-yl)-2,4,6-heptatrienoic acid and (2E,4E,6E)-3,7-dimethyl-7-(2,2,4,4-tetramethylthiochroman -6-yl)-2,4,6- heptatrienoic acid, respectively, were about 3.5 nmol. Heteroarotinoids 8 and 12-17 had ID50 values of 35 nmol or greater. With a thiochroman unit, the most active acids in decreasing order of activity in the ODC assay were 7 greater than 9 greater than 8. Thus, simple replacement of the terminal propenyl system [C(16,17,18)] in 7 with a cyclopropyl group produced acid 8 [(2E,4E,6E)-7-methyl-7-(4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)- 2,3-methylene-4,6-heptadienoic acid with markedly reduced activity. With a benzoic acid group as part of the structure attached to the thiochroman unit, the ODC activity was enhanced as shown in 10 and 11.

The most active were analogues 4c, 4d, 4e, and 6e (IC50 10-20 microM). The corresponding hydroxy derivatives were less active of inactive. Inhibition of macromolecular synthesis with compounds 4c, 4d, 6e, 9c, and 9d follows the order: DNA greater than RNA greater than or equal to protein. Cytotoxic effects of 4c, 6e, and 9d are not reversed with any of the four basic ribonucleosides or 2'-deoxyribonucleosides. Inhibitory activity of cytosine derivative 9c is reversed with uridine and 2'-deoxyuridine but not with the corresponding cytosine nucleosides. Zone assays in several tumor cell lines show that active compounds are cytotoxic agents with little selectivity for tumor cells. Analogue 6c showed 16.7% ILS in leukemia P388/o implanted ip in mice at 510 and 1020 mg/kg, respectively. Cytallene (5b) and 6'beta-hydroxyaristeromycin (10) exhibited significant activity against Friend and Rauscher murine leukemia viruses. The rest of the hydroxy derivatives, with the exception of 4a, were moderately effective or inactive as antiviral agents. None of the chloro derivatives or oxacyclopentenes exhibited an antiviral effect at noncytotoxic concentrations. Z-Olefin 4b and 2-aminoadenallene (5c) are substrates for adenosine deaminase.","['Phadtare, S', 'Kessel, D', 'Corbett, T H', 'Renis, H E', 'Court, B A', 'Zimlicka, J']","['Phadtare S', 'Kessel D', 'Corbett TH', 'Renis HE', 'Court BA', 'Zimlicka J']","['Department of Chemistry, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/drug effects', 'HIV-1/drug effects', 'HIV-2/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Rauscher Virus/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00105a064 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 Jan;34(1):421-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00105a064.,,,['CA 32779/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The geometry of these compounds requires that, when the acridine binds to DNA by intercalation, one alkylating moiety is delivered to each DNA groove. Gel electrophoretic studies show that only one arm of these compounds (probably that attached to the 9-position) alkylates DNA, such alkylation occurring specifically in the major groove at the N7 of guanines. Cell-line studies confirm that the mode of cytotoxicity of these compounds (unlike that of untargeted aniline bis-mustards of comparable reactivity) is due to bulky DNA monoadduct formation.

These analogous are 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (1), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-beta-hydroxyglutamic acid (2), 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (3, MMTX), 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (4, MDAM), and 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-ethyl-10-deazapteroyl-gamma-methyleneglutamic acid (5, MEDAM). None of these compounds were metabolized to the respective polyglutamate derivative as judged by their inability to serve as substrates for CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in vitro. All compounds inhibited recombinant human-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) at nearly equivalent magnitude as MTX. Growth-inhibition studies with H35 hepatoma, Manca human lymphoma, and CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells established greater cytotoxic effects with compounds 3-5 than with compounds 1 and 2. gamma-Methyleneglutamate derivatives 3-5 were transported to H35 hepatoma cells better than MTX or beta-hydroxyglutamate derivatives 1 and 2. Compound 3 was 2.5 times better than MTX in competing with folinic acid transport in H35 hepatoma cells. Compound 1 did not have a significant inhibitory effect on folinic acid transport even at 50 microM under identical conditions. The IC50 for compound 1 against H35-hepatoma cell growth was 8.5-fold higher than MTX. Compounds with the gamma-methyleneglutamate moiety (3-5) exhibited almost equal or lower IC50 values than MTX against the growth of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells. These studies show that on continuous exposure, the non-polyglutamylatable inhibitors DHFR (3-5) can exhibit superior antifolate activity compared to the polyglutamylatable methotrexate, presumably due to their enhanced transport to these cell lines. Compounds 3-5 appear to be excellent models to study the role of polyglutamylation of antifolates in antitumor activity and host toxicity.","['Abraham, A', 'McGuire, J J', 'Galivan, J', 'Nimec, Z', 'Kisliuk, R L', 'Gaumont, Y', 'Nair, M G']","['Abraham A', 'McGuire JJ', 'Galivan J', 'Nimec Z', 'Kisliuk RL', 'Gaumont Y', 'Nair MG']","['Drug Development Laboratory, University of South Alabama, Mobile 36688.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00105a035 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 Jan;34(1):222-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00105a035.,,,"['CA 27101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight of the 10 patients were women. Six patients were from Haiti, three from Jamaica, and one from the Bahamas. All patients had very aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two patients presented with sinus and retro-orbital involvement; another had gastric lymphoma that perforated. Nine patients developed hypercalcemia. Eight patients died within 1 year of diagnosis. Two were lost to follow-up. During the course of this study, 66 new cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were diagnosed at this hospital. Ten of these cases were ATL. The prevalence of HTLV-I-related lymphoma in this sample was 15%. Since tissue from all patients was not available for HTLV-I screening, however, it is possible that other cases of ATL went undetected.

High expression of this antigen in remission patients' bone marrow cells was shown to correlate with both relapse and lower survival times. Preliminary studies showed that material extracted from leukemic cells and eluted from CAMAL-1 immunoadsorbent columns profoundly inhibited the formation of normal colony-forming units (CFU) but had no effect on formation of such colonies from cells of patients with CGL. We have used CAMAL-1 affinity chromatography in combination with FPLC gel filtration to purify the inhibitory material from leukemic cell extracts. We have successfully isolated a 30-kd component (P30) that functions as an inhibitor of normal myelopoiesis in vitro; when P30 was added to normal progenitor cell assays it significantly inhibited the growth of normal CFU but had no inhibitory effect on the growth of CGL progenitor cells at equivalent concentrations. The inhibitory effect is preferentially directed to granulocytic progenitors. Antibodies raised to P30 reacted in Western blot analyses with affinity purified material from patients' cells as well as with a 30-kd component in the cell lysates and supernatants of the leukemic cell lines HL60 and K562; this finding suggested that the P30 inhibitory component might be produced by leukemic cells.","['Shellard, J E', 'Leitch, H A', 'Logan, P M', 'McMaster, W R', 'Levy, J G']","['Shellard JE', 'Leitch HA', 'Logan PM', 'McMaster WR', 'Levy JG']","['Department of Microbiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (common myelogenous leukemia-associated antigen)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Feb;19(2):136-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of primary and secondary cases.,1359-69,"Primary mammary lymphoma is rare, and little is known about the immunophenotype of such cases. The authors studied both primary and secondary breast lymphomas with a broad panel of T- and B-cell markers using paraffin-embedded tissue and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Cases of primary B-cell lymphoma were further tested to determine light and heavy chain type. Thirty-five cases were analyzed, including 16 primary lymphomas. Diffuse large cell lymphoma was present in ten of 16 primary and 14 of 18 secondary cases. Lymphoepithelial lesions in ducts and lobules and frequent vascular involvement were found in both primary and secondary cases. Immunohistochemistry studies on 13 tumors revealed all of the primary tumors to be B-cell in origin, except for one case of primary T-cell lymphoma; to the authors' knowledge, this represents the first description of this entity. Fifteen of 17 secondary tumors exhibited B-cell markers and one of 17 exhibited T-cell markers; in only one case could lineage not be determined. Among primary B-cell cases, IgM was found to be the most frequent heavy chain type; IgA reactivity was found in only one case. Survival was related to stage and histologic characteristics; patients with Stage II disease and higher grade histologic lesions had a worse prognosis. Half of the patients with primary lymphoma have had recurrent disease. Although local recurrences were observed, the authors also saw a tendency for recurrence in other extranodal sites. The authors conclude that, although primary lymphoma of the breast is compatible with long-term survival, a significant number of patients eventually die of their disease. As with other extranodal lymphomas, survival rate appears most related to stage of disease. Also, the vast majority of primary tumors are B-cell in origin, express IgM heavy chain, and can be considered tumors of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.","['Cohen, P L', 'Brooks, J J']","['Cohen PL', 'Brooks JJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910301)67:5<1359::aid-cncr2820670515>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Mar 1;67(5):1359-69. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910301)67:5<1359::aid-cncr2820670515>3.0.co;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both GPIIb and PF4 mRNA were detected in the blast cells. Cytoplasmic maturation occurs later than the synthesis of the surface GP during megakaryocyte maturation. Therefore, PF4 mRNA expression should be a marker of mature megakaryoblasts. The PF4 mRNA expression in megakaryoblastic leukemia may indicate that a patient will have long survival and a good response to chemotherapy.","['Ryo, R', 'Adachi, M', 'Sugano, W', 'Yasunaga, M', 'Yoshida, A', 'Jikai, J', 'Saigo, K', 'Yamaguchi, N', 'Akita, H', 'Yokoyama, M']","['Ryo R', 'Adachi M', 'Sugano W', 'Yasunaga M', 'Yoshida A', 'Jikai J', 'Saigo K', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Akita H', 'Yokoyama M', 'et al.']","['Blood Transfusion Service, Kobe University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Factor 4/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910215)67:4<960::aid-cncr2820670418>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Feb 15;67(4):960-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910215)67:4<960::aid-cncr2820670418>3.0.co;2-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a follow-up study they compared the efficacy and side effects of morphine in two groups of marrow transplant patients who controlled their own analgesic administration either by conventional bolus-dose, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or by adjusting the rate of continuous morphine infusion to increase or decrease their plasma morphine concentration. Patients controlling their morphine infusion rates (pharmacokinetically based patient-controlled analgesia [PKPCA] group) obtained more relief from oral mucositis pain than did patients using conventional PCA. Patients in the PKPCA group used more morphine than PCA patients and achieved superior pain relief without significant increases in side effects (e.g., nausea, mood changes, sedation).

However, little is known about the incidence or importance of these genetic mutations in childhood myeloproliferative states (MPS). The bone marrow (BM) monosomy 7 syndrome accounts for a large percentage of childhood MPS. Although the duration of the MPS is quite variable, children with monosomy 7 eventually develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigated 20 children (13 with MPS, 7 with AML) with BM monosomy 7 or 7q- for the presence of ras gene mutations using the polymerase chain reaction and hybridization with mutation-specific oligonucleotides. Mutations of N-ras and K-ras were detected in three children. Two patients carrying a ras mutation were in the myeloproliferative phase, and one had acute leukemia. All three patients with ras mutations either died of their disease or relapsed after BM transplantation as compared with 8 of 17 without ras mutations. However, this difference is not statistically significant (P = .14, not significant). We conclude that ras mutations are observed in childhood monosomy 7, though less frequently than in adult MDS, and may play a limited role in the progression of this disease to acute leukemia. More patients are needed to address the prognostic role of ras mutations in this rare disease.","['Neubauer, A', 'Shannon, K', 'Liu, E']","['Neubauer A', 'Shannon K', 'Liu E']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7295.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Oligonucleotides)'],IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Male', '*Monosomy', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides/analysis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83071-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Feb 1;77(3):594-8.,,,['R01-CA49240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized infection of the permanent megakaryocytic cell line CMK by HIV in vitro. CMK cells were easily infected by HIV type 2 (HIV-2), producing significant amounts of virus in culture. Infection appeared to be mediated by the CD4 surface antigen on CMK cells. Three different strains of HIV-1 were able to minimally infect CMK cells, suggesting there may be isolates of HIV tropic for megakaryocytes. Infection of CMK cells led to downregulation of the CD4 surface antigen but no discernable change in expression of megakaryocyte-associated proteins glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

To gain further knowledge on the role of retinoylation we studied it in cell lines with varied responses to retinoic acid (RA). Compared to HL60 the extent of retinoylation (mol/cell) was about fivefold higher in HL60/MRI, a mutant which is more sensitive to RA than HL60. Retinoylation occurred to the same extent and at similar rates in HL60 and in HL60/RA-res, a mutant resistant to differentiation by RA. One-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns for the three HL60 cell lines were similar. However, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of the three HL60 cell lines were distinct. While we saw the same major retinoylated protein of Mr 55,000 in the three cell lines, the HL60/RA-res cells also contained a high level of a protein with the same Mr and a lower pI. The extent of retinoylation was greater in the RA-sensitive embryonal carcinoma cell line, PCC4.aza1R, than in a RA-resistant cell line, PCC4.(RA)-2. One-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of retinoylated proteins of the embryonal carcinoma cell lines were different from HL60 and from each other. The retinoylation pattern of the normal canine kidney cell line (MDCK) was different from either HL60 or the embryonal carcinoma cells. These results showed the retinoylation was widespread and that the response to RA of different cell types may depend on the retinoylation of specific proteins.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Teratoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(91)90334-F [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(91)90334-f [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1991 Feb 15;285(1):105-10. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(91)90334-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-B cells transformed by a variety of oncogenes including those of the ABL protein tyrosine kinase family were screened for endogenous IL-7 mRNA expression by polymerase chain reaction and a sensitive bioassay for secreted IL-7. Some v-abl but none of the BCR/ABL, v-src, v-fms, v-myc, v-ras, or v-raf transformants analyzed contained elevated IL-7 transcripts. None of the cell lines secreted detectable bioactivity. We overexpressed IL-7 via a retroviral vector in an IL-7-dependent pre-B cell line to assess the potential for autocrine growth stimulation and malignant transformation. We achieved dramatic deregulation of IL-7 translational suppression by removing portions of the 5' flanking region. Levels of IL-7 expression much greater than those needed to establish factor-independent growth did not induce colony formation in agar by IL-7-expressing pre-B cell lines, and the majority of these lines were nontumorigenic in syngeneic mice. The same pre-B cell line transformed by v-abl displayed a highly malignant phenotype while containing dramatically lower IL-7 transcript levels. We conclude that endogenous IL-7 expression is not a necessary event in transformation of pre-B cells, nor is it sufficient to explain the malignant phenotype in v-abl-transformed cells. Up regulation of endogenous IL-7 expression in some transformed pre-B cells may be one of several synergistic events which can lead to malignant conversion.","['Young, J C', 'Gishizky, M L', 'Witte, O N']","['Young JC', 'Gishizky ML', 'Witte ON']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California-Los Angeles 90024-1570.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Interleukin-7/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Transfection']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.2.854-863.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Feb;11(2):854-63. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.2.854-863.1991.,,PMC359737,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the lines resemble atypical MDR cells (Danks et al., 1987; Beck et al., 1987). Thus, resistant Jurkat sublines were cross resistant to several topoisomerase II inhibiting drugs but had low or no resistance to other classes of drugs, resistance was not reversed by verapamil, Pgp was not overexpressed, and drug accumulation was unaltered in resistant compared to parental (control) sublines. Other findings were that anthracycline metabolism differed between resistant and parental sublines, and that resistant sublines displayed altered expression of small polypeptides (less than 20K MW) and an 85K MW protein. Drug resistant cells showed resistance to the production of drug induced cytogenetic aberrations, DNA breaks, and protein-DNA complexes. Resistance was not mediated by altered binding of drugs to DNA or by increased repair of DNA damage. Indirect evidence suggests that the resistant cells had an altered drug-DNA-topoisomerase II association. The study highlights the complex relationships between DNA breaks, cytogenetic aberrations, protein-DNA complexes and drug cytotoxicity, and shows that the relationships differ for adriamycin and amsacrine, suggesting some differences in the modes of action and/or resistance for the drugs and cell lines.","['Snow, K', 'Judd, W']","['Snow K', 'Judd W']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,,"['Amsacrine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.7 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Jan;63(1):17-28. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.7.,,PMC1971666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tiazofurin is anabolized to the active metabolite, thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), which inhibits IMP dehydrogenase activity, leading to reduction of guanylate pools and cessation of cancer cell proliferation. The concentration of TAD in neoplastic cells of patients treated with tiazofurin should be a good indicator of sensitivity to the drug and also might herald the emergence of drug-resistant cells. Therefore, the precise quantitation of TAD in cancer cells during tiazofurin treatment is essential. In this paper we report a highly sensitive method for the determination of TAD in biological samples. With this technique, in addition to TAD, thirteen other biologically relevant adenine, guanine, cytosine and uridine nucleotides can be separated and quantitated accurately. TAD standard was separated on a Waters Partisil 10-SAX column in a RCM-10 module using an ammonium phosphate buffer system. TAD eluted at 21 min with a limit of detection of 15 pmol and linearity up to 3 nmol. The coefficient of variation was 0.6 +/- 0.1% for retention time and 2 +/- 0.3% for TAD concentration. Recovery of TAD was 96% with reproducibility of 98%. To examine the applicability of this method to a clinical setting, blood samples were obtained from a patient with CGL-BC and leukocytes were separated on a Ficoll-Hypaq gradient, extracted with trichloroacetic acid, and an aliquot was analyzed on HPLC. The TAD peak was identified by comparing the retention time and spectral analysis of the standard. After the patient was treated with a 2200 mg/m2 (12.7 mM) dose of tiazofurin, the TAD concentrations in the mononuclear cells at 2, 6, and 24 hr were 23.1, 13.6, and 0.8 microM. TAD levels at 2, 6, and 24 hr after a tiazofurin dose of 3300 mg/m2 (21.1 mM) were 42.8, 26.1, and 1.4 microM respectively.","['Zhen, W', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Weber, G']","['Zhen W', 'Jayaram HN', 'Weber G']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '83285-83-0 (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Monocytes/*chemistry', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ribavirin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1991/01/15 00:00,1991/01/15 00:01,['1991/01/15 00:00'],"['1991/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(91)90487-P [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90487-p [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 Jan 15;41(2):281-6. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90487-p.,,,"['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S07RR-5371/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell lines used were selected because of their differential responses to protein kinase C activators and included rat-1 fibroblasts, untransformed and A-raf-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and human HL60 leukaemia cells. Exposure of rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts to 100 nM-PMA stimulated phospholipase D-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids about 2- and 6-fold respectively. In contrast, 100 nM-PMA had similar (2.5-3.0-fold) stimulatory effects on PtdCho synthesis in these cell lines. In the untransformed NIH 3T3 cells, both PMA and bryostatin stimulated both phospholipid hydrolysis and PtdCho synthesis, with 100 nM-bryostatin being somewhat less potent than 100 nM-TPA. In contrast, in A-raf-transformed NIH 3T3 cells or in HL60 cells, only TPA, but not bryostatin, stimulated PtdCho synthesis. In these transformed cells, bryostatin had 3-fold, or higher, stimulatory effects on phospholipid hydrolysis. Addition of ionomycin, a Ca2(+)-elevating agent, partially restored the stimulatory effect of bryostatin on PtdCho synthesis, but it failed to modify the effect of bryostatin on phospholipid hydrolysis. These data indicate that increased phospholipid hydrolysis is not necessarily associated with increased PtdCho synthesis.","['Kiss, Z', 'Chattopadhyay, J', 'Pettit, G R']","['Kiss Z', 'Chattopadhyay J', 'Pettit GR']","['Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin 55912.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bryostatins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*biosynthesis', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2730189 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Jan 1;273(Pt 1):189-94. doi: 10.1042/bj2730189.,,PMC1149897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects were all workers with potential plant exposure who were employed for at least 3 months during 1948-72. Vital status was determined as of 12/31/83 for 98% of the cohort and death certificates were obtained for 95.4% of 1,180 observed deaths. The statistical analyses excluded 159 female study members. For all causes of death combined, all cancers combined, and for most of the nonmalignant disease categories examined, there were deficits in mortality among refinery workers, chemical plant workers, and workers with experience in both areas. These deficits were generally most pronounced for chemical plant workers. An analysis of specific cancer sites revealed patterns of increased risk suggestive of a possible relationship between occupational exposures in the refinery and lympho-reticulosarcoma. Patterns of increased risk were also observed among chemical plant workers for a category of lymphopoietic tissue cancers, including multiple myeloma, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and certain non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Some very limited evidence of a possible workplace association was also found among refinery workers for leukemia and cancers of the central nervous system and biliary passages/liver. No evidence was found of an increased risk for cancer of the respiratory system or stomach or for malignant melanoma. A work history review of all suspect cancer excesses failed to identify any common work areas, job assignments, or exposure potentials, although the lack of detailed data on specific chemical exposures precluded accurate assessments of exposure-response.","['Marsh, G M', 'Enterline, P E', 'McCraw, D']","['Marsh GM', 'Enterline PE', 'McCraw D']","['Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Cause of Death', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Petroleum', 'Risk Factors', 'Texas']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700190105 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1991;19(1):29-42. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700190105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies have also shown that when the M-MuLV IN protein is produced in Escherichia coli it retains an ability to specifically associate with the viral inverted repeats (Krogstad and Champoux, 1990). In this study we present evidence that the IN protein present in detergent-disrupted virions is capable of specifically interacting with double-stranded oligonucleotides that correspond to the viral inverted repeats, and that this interaction may change after integration-related processing of the viral att sites.

Addition of the tRNA wobble base queuine, in the presence of 6-TG, maintains the proliferative capability of the cells. The ability of 6-TG to induce differentiation correlates with c-myc mRNA down-regulation, but queuine has no effect on this parameter. Treatment with 6-TG for 2-3 days commits HL-60 cells to granulocytic differentiation, and, once committed, these cells do not respond to the monocytic inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Nonetheless, when cells are treated with queuine and 6-TG, they maintain the promyelocytic morphology and are capable of being induced down the monocytic pathway by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as indicated by stabilization of c-fms mRNA and cell adherence. In the absence of queuine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is incapable of inducing monocytic markers in the 6-TG-treated cells. The data presented indicate that 6-TG-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is a tRNA-facilitated event and that the tRNA wobble base queuine is capable of maintaining both the proliferative and pluripotent potential of the cells.","['French, B T', 'Patrick, D E', 'Grever, M R', 'Trewyn, R W']","['French BT', 'Patrick DE', 'Grever MR', 'Trewyn RW']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Anticodon)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '72496-59-4 (queuine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,,"['Anticodon/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",1991/01/15 00:00,1991/01/15 00:01,['1991/01/15 00:00'],"['1991/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.2.370 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jan 15;88(2):370-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.2.370.,['c-myc'],PMC50812,"['5-T32-CA-09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-16058-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to understand better the role of H1(0) in this process we have tried to determine at which level the regulation of its induced accumulation occurs. Protein H1(0) was found to increase by a factor of 3 while its mRNA increased by a factor of 14, due to activation of gene transcription. As shown by H1(0) half-life measurements, the difference between the actual amount of H1(0) and that expected from the amount of mRNA was not due to increased turnover of the protein. Fractionation of the translational apparatus at several times during induction, revealed that H1(0) mRNA was efficiently transferred to the high molecular weight polysomes. The rate of synthesis of H1(0) was also increased by a factor of 4. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a strong control at the translational level, which regulates H1(0) accumulation.","['Rousseau, D', 'Khochbin, S', 'Gorka, C', 'Lawrence, J J']","['Rousseau D', 'Khochbin S', 'Gorka C', 'Lawrence JJ']","['Unite INSERM 309, Departement de Biologie Moleculaire et Structurale, CEN-Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Densitometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Histones/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/05 00:00,1991/01/05 00:01,['1991/01/05 00:00'],"['1991/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-2836(91)90613-B [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2836(91)90613-b [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1991 Jan 5;217(1):85-92. doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(91)90613-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phenotype of these cells suggests that they are ""frozen"" at an early stage of maturation. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly used to treat patients with B-CLL, resulting in a reduction in the peripheral lymphocyte count by an undefined mechanism. Here we report that glucocorticoids stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of a suicide process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) in suspensions of cells from patients with B-CLL. The effects can be mimicked by Ca2+ ionophore and involve a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Specific antibodies binding to membrane-associated IgM on the leukemic cells can also induce PCD by a similar mechanism. Phorbol esters block DNA fragmentation and cell killing in response to all of the agents, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C desensitizes the cells to PCD. Targeting the B-CLL cells with antibodies that induce an unbalanced, sustained Ca2+ increase may therefore represent a rational strategy for the destruction of leukemic cells.","['McConkey, D J', 'Aguilar-Santelises, M', 'Hartzell, P', 'Eriksson, I', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Orrenius, S', 'Jondal, M']","['McConkey DJ', 'Aguilar-Santelises M', 'Hartzell P', 'Eriksson I', 'Mellstedt H', 'Orrenius S', 'Jondal M']","['Department of Toxicology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Feb 1;146(3):1072-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological subtypes were refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) in 4, RAEB in transformation (RAEB/T) in 3 and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) in 3 cases. IFN was administered subcutaneously at increasing doses of 1 to 3 x 10(6) IU per day. The median duration of therapy was 6 months (range, 3 to 14). 2 patients, both with a diagnosis of CMML, achieved a complete and partial remission, respectively. In the complete responder, remission could be maintained for 9.5 months by daily administration of 1 x 10(6) IU IFN. The other patients were classified as failures, although in 4 cases a decrease of bone marrow blasts was noted and none of the patients progressed to overt leukaemia while being treated with IFN. During the study, all patients with RAEB and RAEB/T showed a moderate to severe reduction in peripheral leukocyte and platelet counts, requiring premature termination of IFN therapy in 5 cases. Despite adequate supportive measures, 2 patients died of pneumococcal pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively.

However, the biotransformations of tetraplatin have not been studied in detail. We have followed the intracellular biotransformations of tetraplatin and PtCl2(dach) in the L1210 cell line by a two-step high performance liquid chromatography separation procedure described previously (Mauldin et al., Cancer Res., 48: 5136-5144, 1988). At early times the intracellular biotransformation pathways appeared to be very different in tetraplatin- and PtCl2(dach)-treated cells. The tetraplatin present in the medium initially was taken up preferentially by the L1210 cells. However, no intracellular tetraplatin and very little intracellular PtCl2(dach) were found in the tetraplatin-treated cells. Instead, two previously unidentified biotransformation products predominated at early times. The same biotransformation products were present in cells incubated in Hank's balanced salt solution, so they most likely did not arise from extracellular reactions. The unidentified biotransformation products present in tetraplatin-treated cells at early times appeared to be at the platinum(II) level of oxidation. Model reactions suggested that these compounds could have been formed by platinum(II)-assisted platinum(IV) substitution reactions, followed by reduction of the platinum(IV) complex to the platinum(II) level. Thus, there appear to exist unique features of tetraplatin metabolism which are observed only when tetraplatin is taken up directly by the cell without prior reduction. These reaction products did not react with DNA and presumably represent an inactivation pathway.","['Chaney, S G', 'Gibbons, G R', 'Wyrick, S D', 'Podhasky, P']","['Chaney SG', 'Gibbons GR', 'Wyrick SD', 'Podhasky P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '52691-24-4 (dichloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum complex)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biotransformation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Feb 1;51(3):969-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia patients with evidence of persistent disease were further subdivided into two groups according to the percentage of bone marrow (BM) blasts: group a had 6-15% blasts and group b had 30-65%. Following two cycles of IL2 (Glaxo Imb, Geneva, Switzerland) given i.v. by continuous infusion at escalating doses, no major changes in the proportion of CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive cells were encountered in the blood or in the marrow of either group of patients. When these could be retested after four cycles of IL2, a significant increase of CD3+ and CD4+ cells was documented in the peripheral blood (PB), as well as a significant increase of CD3+ cells in the BM. Irrespective of the number of cycles administered, the proportion of CD16+ cells increased significantly in the blood in both groups of patients and in the marrow of group a patients only. The expression of CD25 was significantly enhanced in all samples tested. Following IL2 administration, an enhancement of the natural killer compartment was documented. This was consistently more evident in patients with more limited disease. A significant amplification of the in vitro-induced lymphokine-activated killer function was noted in the BM of the treated patients. Furthermore, we documented the presence both in the PB and in the BM of ""spontaneous"" lymphokine-activated killer cells generated in vivo following IL2 administration. These results demonstrate that in acute leukemia of both myeloid and lymphoid origin, treatment with IL2 is capable of inducing profound immunophenotypic and functional modifications in PB and in BM lymphocytes, particularly in patients with more limited disease. The evidence of the in vivo activation of cytotoxic cells, particularly in the BM, may help to explain the clinical responses preliminarily observed in individual acute leukemia patients.","['Foa, R', 'Guarini, A', 'Gillio Tos, A', 'Cardona, S', 'Fierro, M T', 'Meloni, G', 'Tosti, S', 'Mandelli, F', 'Gavosto, F']","['Foa R', 'Guarini A', 'Gillio Tos A', 'Cardona S', 'Fierro MT', 'Meloni G', 'Tosti S', 'Mandelli F', 'Gavosto F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', '*Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects', '*Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*immunology/*therapy']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Feb 1;51(3):964-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have shown that lymphomagenesis in pim-1 transgenic mice can be accelerated by infecting pim-1 transgenic mice with murine leukemia viruses or by treating the mice with a relatively low dose of 60 mg of the carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) per kg of body weight. Here we describe the incidence of tumors as a function of the dose of ENU. Either 200, 15, 4, 1, or 0.1 mg/kg ENU was injected into transgenic and control mice and the tumor incidence was monitored. T-cell lymphomas developed in 100 and 70% of the pim-1 transgenic mice treated with 200 and 15 mg/kg ENU, respectively. Approximately 20% of the Emu-pim-1 transgenic mice developed lymphomas after treatment with either 4, 1, or 0.1 mg/kg ENU. The nontransgenic mice developed lymphomas only after injection with 200 mg/kg (45%). The data show that Emu-pim-1 transgenic mice are approximately 25-fold more susceptible to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis than control mice. In most tumors the expression of c-myc was strongly elevated, probably as a direct or indirect effect of ENU. Analysis of the lymphomas for ras mutations revealed that approximately 10% of the lymphomas bear a ras mutation. The data indicate that at least some of these mutations are not the direct result of alkylation by ENU but rather represent spontaneous mutations that occurred later in the tumorigenic process.","['Breuer, M', 'Wientjens, E', 'Verbeek, S', 'Slebos, R', 'Berns, A']","['Breuer M', 'Wientjens E', 'Verbeek S', 'Slebos R', 'Berns A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Probes)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon', 'DNA Probes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethylnitrosourea', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', '*Genes, myc', '*Genes, ras', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Mutation/genetics']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Feb 1;51(3):958-63.,['pim-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were investigated prior to chemotherapy (stage I), during seven weeks of induction chemotherapy (stage II), and thereafter during intermittent high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) therapy (stage III). The patients were followed for a period of three to 15 months, and the study included a total of 80 HD-MTX courses. Before start of chemotherapy (stage I), the average plasma homocysteine level in the children with leukemia was 13.18 +/- 6.23 (SD) mumol/liter, which is significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than the level in control children (6.52 +/- 1.21 mumol/liter). The plasma homocysteine level in the patients was positively correlated with the peripheral white blood cell count (P less than 0.01) and negatively correlated with serum folate (P less than 0.02). The serum folate was normal or subnormal in these patients. During induction therapy with cytotoxic drugs such as vincristine, asparaginase, and intrathecal MTX (stage II), there was a drastic change in plasma homocysteine as a function of time. A reciprocal alteration in serum folate was observed, suggesting fluctuating intracellular folate status at this stage of therapy. At the end of stage II (about seven weeks), there was a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in total homocysteine (to 7.08 +/- 3.84 mumol/liter). HD-MTX (8 g/m2) therapy with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate ""rescue"" (stage III) was usually begun about seven weeks after start of chemotherapy, and the patients were followed for two to eight courses separated by three to eight weeks. Plasma homocysteine showed a transient increase (26-64%) following each MTX infusion. After three MTX infusions, basal total plasma homocysteine was reduced to 5.56 +/- 1.12 mumol/liter. During most MTX infusions, there was a variable reduction (17-56%) in plasma methionine followed by a rebound increase. It is concluded that plasma homocysteine in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is elevated prior to therapy, probably because of occasional folate deficiency and increased burden of proliferating cells. During induction therapy, monitoring plasma homocysteine and serum folate both suggest a labile folate homeostasis, usually a deficiency state.

Like other ether lipids it is of interest as a membrane-active antitumor agent. Here, we have used two-color multiparameter flow cytometry to study simultaneously its effects on cell membrane permeability, intracellular pH, and cell size/structure of EMT6 mouse mammary tumor cells and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro. Concentrations as low as 1 microM up to 100 microM SRI 62-834 caused a rapid, dose-dependent increase in membrane permeability, initially towards outward efflux of the preloaded fluorescein probe bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescein (green fluorescence) and then towards influx of extracellular propidium (red fluorescence). At the same time, median cell size from light scatter was reduced with an increased coefficient of variation, and the proportion of cell debris was elevated. In vitro antitumor activity was seen over the same concentration range, as measured by tetrazolium dye reduction and cell growth curves. Neither low concentrations of PAF (50 nM) nor the potent PAF antagonist 3-[4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f][1,2,4]tria- zolo[4,3a][1,4]diazepin-2-yl]-1-(4-morpholinyl)-1-propanone (0.5-100 microM) had any influence on the membrane effects of SRI 62-834, and at higher concentrations (1-200 microM) PAF mimicked the behavior of SRI 62-834. In addition, the PAF antagonist did not modulate the cytotoxicity of SRI 62-834 or PAF. HL-60 cells were more sensitive to SRI 62-834 than were EMT6 cells in terms of both cytotoxicity and membrane permeability. However, PAF was more potent than SRI 62-834 in causing membrane permeabilization with both cell lines, whereas PAF was less active than SRI 62-834 in cytotoxicity assays. The results support a membrane-damaging role in the cytotoxicity of SRI 62-834 but suggest that additional factors are also involved. Membrane permeabilization may be related to its reported effects on protein kinase C-dependent intracellular calcium signaling but apparently does not involve a conventional PAF receptor in HL-60 or EMT6 cells.","['Dive, C', 'Watson, J V', 'Workman, P']","['Dive C', 'Watson JV', 'Workman P']","['Medical Research Council Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapeutics Unit, Medical Research Council Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Triazoles)', '105219-56-5 (WEB 2086)', '113201-37-9 (SRI 62-834)', '85733-91-1 (1-0-octadecyl 2-0-acetyl sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Feb 1;51(3):799-806.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now demonstrate that BEPH treatment alone, given on a more frequent schedule (5 mg/kg, day 3, 4, 5) or at a higher dose (10 mg/kg, day 3, 4), cures 100% of L1210 leukemic mice. These treated animals were subsequently immune to a second challenge with L1210 tumor cells. However, mice cured with BEPH did not reject P388 leukemic cells, although their mean survival time was slightly prolonged. In an in vivo tumor neutralization assay, splenocytes from cured mice and L1210 cells were injected into naive mice; 80% did not develop L1210 leukemia. Coculturing lymphocytes from cured mice with L1210 cells in vitro generated a potent tumor-specific cytolytic response against L1210 target cells, whereas lymphocytes from naive mice did not generate any significant cytolytic activity. Both the in vitro and in vivo activities were completely eliminated by pretreating the splenic lymphocyte population with anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal antibodies and complement, indicating T-cells as the effector population. In T-cell-deficient nude mice BEPH treatment was not curative, increasing survival time by approximately 2-fold. We conclude from these studies that T-cell-mediated immunity plays a pivotal role in the mechanism by which synthetic polyamine analogues, such as BEPH, prevent neoplastic growth.","['Bowlin, T L', 'Prakash, N J', 'Edwards, M L', 'Sjoerdsma, A']","['Bowlin TL', 'Prakash NJ', 'Edwards ML', 'Sjoerdsma A']","['Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio 45215.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diamines)', ""132004-62-7 (N,N'-bis(3-(ethylamino)propyl)-1,7-heptanediamine)""]",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Diamines/*therapeutic use', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jan 1;51(1):62-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry of asynchronous B16 cells grown with geraniol (0-0.15 mM) revealed a population characterized by larger cells with altered nuclear characteristics. Over the course of four studies, dietary geraniol increased the 50% survival time of mice by 10, 29, 33, and 50% following the i.p. transfer of P388 cells.

In this study we examine the in vitro cytotoxicity against pleiotropic drug-resistant sublines of human tumor cell lines. MX2 was effective against multidrug-resistant sublines of four human tumor cell lines; these cells, having a 4.8- to 200-fold cross-resistance to Adriamycin (ADM) showed only a 0.7- to 2.3-fold resistance to MX2 compared with the sensitive cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which MX2 overcomes multidrug resistance, the intracellular pharmacology of MX2 in human myelogenous leukemia K562 and its ADM-resistant subline (K562/ADM) was examined. Both K562 and K562/ADM cells accumulated MX2 more easily than ADM, and the intracellular accumulation of MX2 attained a steady state in both cell lines within 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. The amount of MX2 that accumulated in K562/ADM at a steady state was only 1.3 times lower than that in K562. However, ADM was accumulated slowly in both cell lines compared with MX2, and the intercellular concentration reached a steady state in K562/ADM after 90 min of incubation and in K562 after more than 120 min. K562/ADM cells accumulated a 3.3-fold lower concentration of ADM than K562 after 120 min of exposure. The steady-state concentration of ADM in K562/ADM was 8.3 times lower than that of MX2. In addition, greater than 70% of MX2 was retained in both cell lines after 150 min of incubation in the absence of this drug. Verapamil, a calcium antagonist, hardly augmented the cytotoxicity of MX2 against K562/ADM, and no distinct effect of this drug on both the time course and the maximal level of accumulation of MX2 was observed. Interestingly, MX2 effectively inhibited ATP/Mg2(+)-dependent [3H]vincristine binding to K562/ADM membrane preparations, indicating that MX2 could be transported outside the cell by an active efflux pump. The high intracellular accumulation and retention of MX2 in K562/ADM through the rapid influx of the drug into the cells may be one of the reasons why MX2 circumvents pleiotropic drug resistance.","['Watanabe, M', 'Komeshima, N', 'Naito, M', 'Isoe, T', 'Otake, N', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Watanabe M', 'Komeshima N', 'Naito M', 'Isoe T', 'Otake N', 'Tsuruo T']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratory, Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd., Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '105026-50-4 (morpholinoanthracycline MX2)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'E7437K3983 (Carubicin)']",IM,,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Carubicin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jan 1;51(1):157-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radioimmunoassay of prolifigen TK ""Daiichi"", was used for this assay. Eighty-seven serum samples were collected from 40 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in four institutions. The levels of TK were measured in the time of pretreatment, remission, and recurrence, and the relationship between the levels of TK and either LDH, marrow blasts, or circulating blasts was also examined. The levels of TK were significantly lower in the state of remission than in the pretreatment. However, the level of TK in remission was much elevated in the majority of cases than normal range (less than or equal to 5 units/l). On the contrary, LDH in remission was within normal limits in the majority of cases. The level of TK in the state of relapse was significantly higher than in the remission. The level of TK correlated in some extent with the percentage of marrow blasts (r = 0.508), and the level of TK in more than 5% of marrow blast was most beyond normal range. Correlation coefficient between the percentage of circulating blasts and TK (r = 0.577) was slightly higher than that between the percentage of marrow blasts and TK. Correlation coefficient between the level of TK and the number of marrow blasts was higher than that between LDH and number of marrow blasts. The levels of TK correlated well with serum LDH (r = 0.778), and was more sensitive than LDH. In conclusion, it was suggested that TK could be used as one of an useful and supplemental tumor marker in the follow-up of treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and to monitor the effect of therapy.","['Sampi, K', 'Takagi, T', 'Sakai, C', 'Kuraishi, Y', 'Ishige, K']","['Sampi K', 'Takagi T', 'Sakai C', 'Kuraishi Y', 'Ishige K']","['Saitama Cancer Center, Hematology Clinic, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Development of PCR technique markedly increased the possibility for the use of DNA analysis in clinical medicine.

The CD21 antigen was present in significantly lower proportion when compared to all other B-cell markers. This suggests the presence of immature B-cell population. Correlation studies showed a strong correlation between the presence of the CD5 antigen and the antigens CD19, CD20, HLA-DR and sIg, while a similar correlation could not be proved between the CD5 antigen and CD21 marker.

To test this view and the hypothesis that immune suppression or stimulation could affect B-cell lymphoma (BCL) induction, we administered chronically to MRC-Wistar (MRC-W) rats of both sexes 98% pure 245T (600 mg/kg diet), 86% pure PCP (500 mg/kg diet), methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg ip weekly), and Freund's adjuvant (0.5 ml im every 3-6 wk) for 40 wk, together with 75 mg 2-hydroxyethylnitrosourea (HENU)/l drinking water, a system known to induce B-cell lymphoma. The 245T was shown to contain only 1-4 micrograms/kg each of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), but the PCP contained 25 micrograms TCDD and 670 micrograms TCDF/kg. HENU given alone induced B-cell lymphoma and osteosarcoma as before, with higher incidences of both tumors in males than in females. The B-cell lymphoma diagnosis was confirmed by immunologic typing of cell-surface markers and by probes for gene rearrangements.

Other platinum complexes, particularly those containing 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) are of interest as they effectively kill both sensitive (L1210/0) and cisplatin-resistant (L1210/DDP) cell lines. An L1210/DACH cell line has been developed that is preferentially resistant to DACH-Pt complexes. In the current experiments, we investigated the role that DNA repair has in resistance to DACH-Pt compounds. The DACH ligand exists in 3 isomeric forms which exhibit markedly different activities in the various resistant cell lines. Generally, R,R-DACH-Pt was the most effective isomer. DNA repair was assayed by host-cell reactivation of platinated pRSVcat. DNA damage induced by all the isomeric DACH-Pt-SO4 complexes markedly reduced CAT expression in sensitive L1210/0 cells. One adduct per transcribed strand of the cat gene inhibited CAT expression demonstrating that the sensitive cells exhibited no detectable DNA repair. All the resistant cell lines reactivated the plasmid DNA whether damaged with cisplatin or any of the 3 DACH-Pt isomers. Therefore, resistance to both cisplatin and DACH-Pt appears to be mediated by enhanced DNA repair, but the level of reactivation of the transfected plasmid did not correlate with the toxicity of each analogue. These results suggest that some additional event(s) is responsible for the substrate specificity of repair of genomic DNA. These resistant cell lines also exhibited resistance to UV irradiation but this was much less than, and did not correlate with the degree of resistance to either cisplatin or DACH-Pt. However, there was a good correlation between resistance to UV irradiation and reactivation of UV-damaged plasmid DNA. This enhanced reactivation suggests that enhanced repair may be the sole reason for the resistance to UV irradiation.","['Jennerwein, M M', 'Eastman, A', 'Khokhar, A R']","['Jennerwein MM', 'Eastman A', 'Khokhar AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '52691-24-4 (dichloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum complex)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*toxicity', 'Plasmids', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0921-8777(91)90044-P [pii]', '10.1016/0921-8777(91)90044-p [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1991 Jan;254(1):89-96. doi: 10.1016/0921-8777(91)90044-p.,,,"['CA36039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The APRT-deficient subclones were, however, significantly more sensitive than wild-type cells to mutagenesis to 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine resistance and 6-thioguanine resistance by EMS and MMS. The APRT-deficient subclones were found to have significantly decreased levels of dATP and dTTP nucleotides and decreased levels of all four ribonucleoside triphosphates (ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP) relative to wild-type cells.

Permanent cell lines derived from these tumors (E mu-N-myc cell lines) express extremely high levels of the N-myc transgene but little or no detectable endogenous N-myc or c-myc. We have employed nuclear run-on assays to show that down-regulation of endogenous N- and c-myc expression occurs at the transcriptional level. To determine whether the lack of endogenous myc gene transcription is a direct effect of high-level N-myc transgene expression, we have generated Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed cell lines from prelymphomatous E mu-N-myc mice (A-MuLV/E mu-N-myc cell lines). Although these A-MuLV/E mu-N-myc lines express very high levels of the N-myc transgene, they continue to transcribe the endogenous c-myc gene. These findings demonstrate that high-level N-myc gene expression alone does not necessarily lead to down-regulation of endogenous myc gene expression and suggest that events associated with transformation by N-myc may be critical to this process.","['Ma, A', 'Smith, R K', 'Tesfaye, A', 'Achacoso, P', 'Dildrop, R', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Alt, F W']","['Ma A', 'Smith RK', 'Tesfaye A', 'Achacoso P', 'Dildrop R', 'Rosenberg N', 'Alt FW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.1.440-444.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Jan;11(1):440-4. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.1.440-444.1991.,,PMC359646,"['AI20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23767/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both species of IFN induce a substantial increase in heme, hemoglobin, and transferrin receptor levels. In vitro run-on transcription assays indicate that IFN-beta moderately stimulates transcription of the alpha-globin gene but not the transferrin receptor gene. It is postulated that IFN induces the enhancing effect on differentiation via a marked increase of heme synthesis and number of transferrin receptors, which in turn leads to an enhancement of globin chain synthesis.

Transferrin receptor expression is closely related to the rate of cell proliferation, and conjugates between anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibodies and toxins have been shown to have potent cytotoxic activity. We have constructed an anti-transferrin receptor immunotoxin by conjugating the anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody B3/25 to a ribosome-inactivating protein, the saporin-6 (SO6), which is derived from the seeds of the plant Saponaria officinalis. The immunotoxin B3/25-SO6 was tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against the human cell lines K-562 and HL-60 and against normal human bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and acute myeloid leukemia clonogenic cells. The immunotoxin proved to be an effective inhibitor of K-562 and HL-60 clonogenic cell growth, in vitro colony formation being completely inhibited at immunotoxin concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-10) M. B3/25-SO6 markedly reduced the recloning efficiency of HL-60 clonogenic cells at 10(-12) M. Exposure of HL-60 cells in suspension culture to 10(-9) M B3/25-SO6 for 48-72 h completely abolished their clonogenic potential. The immunotoxin was also found to be cytotoxic against normal human bone marrow progenitor cells (burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage) in a dose-dependent manner. However, exposure of normal colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage in suspension culture to 10(-9) M B3/25-SO6 for 72 h resulted in only 50% suppression of their clonogenic potential. Finally, B3/25-SO6 was found to be a potent inhibitor of in vitro growth of acute myeloid leukemia clonogenic cells. The cytotoxic effects of B3/25-SO6 were shown to be specific, since both saporin alone and irrelevant immunotoxins did not have any effect in the cellular systems examined. We conclude that the immunotoxin B3/25-SO6 has dose-related cytotoxic effects on both normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitors. Since there are substantial differences between normal and leukemic progenitors with respect to the proportion of cycling cells and the expression of transferrin receptors, B3/25-SO6 or similar immunotoxins may have clinical application in bone marrow-purging procedures.","['Cazzola, M', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Dezza, L', ""D'Uva, R"", 'Ponchio, L', 'Rosti, V', 'Ascari, E']","['Cazzola M', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Dezza L', ""D'Uva R"", 'Ponchio L', 'Rosti V', 'Ascari E']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, University of Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico S.

Seven patients conceived while receiving treatment for their neoplasms; in 22 patients, the hematologic disease was diagnosed during pregnancy, and the remaining 27 patients became pregnant after completion of the antineoplastic treatment. When a comparison was made of the evolution of these pregnancies to that of pregnancies in a healthy population, no increase in the incidence of complications was observed: 64% of the pregnancies went to term, 9% resulted in spontaneous abortion, and 5% resulted in premature births. The observed incidence of one major malformation in 56 pregnancies did not differ from the frequency of malformations in the offspring of healthy individuals. There were no fetal losses in six pregnancies in which conception occurred during the first year after chemotherapy. In spite of the inherent limitations derived from the design of this type of study and the type of subject analyzed, the data here support the hypothesis that the cytostatic treatment of hematologic malignancies, if deemed necessary, should not be postponed because of pregnancy. Moreover, the authors agree with advice recommending that no antifolic or alkylating agents be used for prolonged periods and that radiotherapy be avoided, especially to those fields involving the pelvic area.","['Zuazu, J', 'Julia, A', 'Sierra, J', 'Valentin, M G', 'Coma, A', 'Sanz, M A', 'Batlle, J', 'Flores, A']","['Zuazu J', 'Julia A', 'Sierra J', 'Valentin MG', 'Coma A', 'Sanz MA', 'Batlle J', 'Flores A']","['Hematology Service of Hospital Valle de Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Abortion, Induced', 'Abortion, Spontaneous/epidemiology', 'Adult', 'Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Death', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/*therapy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*therapy']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910201)67:3<703::aid-cncr2820670329>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Feb 1;67(3):703-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910201)67:3<703::aid-cncr2820670329>3.0.co;2-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aneuploid DNA stemlines were found in 38.2% of untreated patients with a median DNA index (DNA-I) of 1.15 in marrow aspirates and 1.22 in biopsy specimens. The median percentage of cells with abnormal DNA content was 31.5 (aspirates) and 35 (biopsy specimens) and a positive correlation with the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells was observed. Significantly higher proliferation (S-phase) was found in marrow biopsy specimens as compared with marrow aspirates. Significantly higher RNA content (RNA index [RNA-I]) was observed in aneuploid versus diploid patients in biopsy material. There was no difference in response to the Memorial Hospital M-2 protocol between diploid and aneuploid patients. In patients with DNA-I greater than 1.15 remission duration was shorter as compared with DNA-I less than or equal to 1.15. Furthermore, no difference in cellular RNA content was noted between responders and nonresponders. This study demonstrates no correlation between cellular RNA content and response, as previously described for patients treated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), but DNA aneuploidy appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in MM patients treated with the M-2 protocol.

Sarcomas of bone were the most common second malignant neoplasm (SMN) reported to the Late Effects Study Group, a 13-institution consortium consisting of pediatric oncology centers from western Europe, Canada, and the United States. The authors attempted to relate the histologic subtypes of the 91 bone tumors to clinical factors such as previous therapy and genetic predisposition because morphologic variants have been shown to have biologic significance in other tumors and may have etiologic import. The literature concerning the subtypes of bone tumors, clinical and experimental, is also reviewed. The authors also investigated the effect of several factors on the time interval from the first diagnosis to the SMN (i.e., the bone sarcoma). Anthracyclines significantly shortened the interval by about 3 years.

Etoposide (VP16; 20 to 30 micrograms/mL) with or without cytosine arabinoside (Ara C; 10 mg/mL) was used in tandem with the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), MY9, chosen because CD33 is found on the stem cell pool in the majority of patients with ANLL. The agents were tested singly or sequentially, with a 1-hour incubation of the drugs preceding complement-mediated lysis using MY9. VP16 combined with Ara C killed up to 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 5.11 +/- 0.4 logs of the human ANLL cell lines HL60 and K562 at drug concentrations that killed only 1.2 +/- 0.1 logs of normal committed granulocyte/macrophage stem cells (CFU-GM). Adding a single exposure of the MY9 and complement (C') to the drug-treated cells, greater than 5.4 logs of HL60 were killed. Similar to other pharmacologic agents, no differential kill for clonagenic leukemic cells (colony-forming unit-leukemia; CFU-L) from patients with ANLL was seen for drug only treated blasts versus normal CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), with less than 1 log CFU-L kill at drug concentrations that spared 1 log of CFU-GM. Similarly, only 1.1 +/- 0.3 logs of ANLL CFU-L were eliminated using MY9 and C'. However, with the sequential VP16/Ara C----MY9 + C' treatment, synergy was demonstrated and 2.6 +/- 0.3 logs of CFU-L were eliminated. Because CD33 is also found on the normal CFU-GM pool, two-stage long-term BM cultures were performed to determine pluripotent stem cell elimination by the drug/MoAb purging combination. No difference of CFU-GM or BFU-E production at 4 to 6 weeks of culture for VP16/Ara C, MY9 + C', or VP16/AraC----My9 + C' treated cells was seen compared with untreated controls indicating sparing of early progenitor cells. Sequential ex vivo treatment of human ANLL CFU-L with VP16/Ara C followed by complement-mediated lysis using MY9 synergistically kills CFU-L while sparing early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and thus may be a more effective way to purge BM than either alone.","['Stiff, P J', 'Schulz, W C', 'Bishop, M', 'Marks, L']","['Stiff PJ', 'Schulz WC', 'Bishop M', 'Marks L']","['Department of Medicine, Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/01/15 00:00,1991/01/15 00:01,['1991/01/15 00:00'],"['1991/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77801-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jan 15;77(2):355-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cells from 24 leukemias, single bcr-abl PCR products were detected that corresponded to breakpoints in the minor breakpoint cluster region (mbcr in intron 1 of the bcr gene) associated with production of the P190 fusion protein. Cells from the three remaining leukemias contained breakpoints in the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) as shown by PCR and Southern blot analyses. These three leukemias also contained low levels of the mbcr PCR product that may have resulted from alternative splicing of the bcr-abl precursor RNA. A screen of 35 additional leukemias from patients who failed therapy before day 180 (induction failures or early relapses) found one case with unsuccessful cytogenetics to express Mbcr-abl RNA. All four children with Mbcr breakpoints had white blood cell levels in excess of 250,000 at presentation (compared with 2 of 24 with mbcr breakpoints) and two had hematologic and clinical features suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis. Our results indicate that in Ph1-positive pediatric leukemias, all 9;22 breakpoints occur in one of the two known breakpoint cluster regions in the bcr gene on chromosome 22. The reverse PCR reliably detected all patients with cytogenetic t(9;22) and is capable of detecting additional Ph1-positive leukemias that are missed by standard cytogenetics. Furthermore, the Mbcr-type breakpoint, associated with production of p210, can be seen in childhood leukemias presenting either as clinical ALL or as apparent lymphoid blast crisis of CML, suggesting that t(9;22) breakpoint locations do not exclusively determine the biologic and clinical features of pediatric Ph1-positive ALL.","['Suryanarayan, K', 'Hunger, S P', 'Kohler, S', 'Carroll, A J', 'Crist, W', 'Link, M P', 'Cleary, M L']","['Suryanarayan K', 'Hunger SP', 'Kohler S', 'Carroll AJ', 'Crist W', 'Link MP', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5324.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",1991/01/15 00:00,1991/01/15 00:01,['1991/01/15 00:00'],"['1991/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77797-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jan 15;77(2):324-30.,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chimeric BCR-ABL mRNAs resulting from the translocation encode either a 210-Kd or a 190-Kd protein. The techniques used to detect Ph1 chromosome include karyotyping, Southern analysis to demonstrate bcr rearrangement, and polymerase chain reaction to amplify the BCR-ABL transcripts. However, the routine performance of these methods by clinical laboratories is cumbersome, time consuming, and exposes laboratory personnel to radioisotopes. We describe here the clinical application of a new method, the hybridization protection assay (HPA), which uses chemiluminescent acridinium-ester-labeled probes in conjunction with PCR for detection of the amplified BCR-ABL sequences. The method is sensitive, specific, and can reliably distinguish between the transcripts for P190BCR-ABL and P210BCR-ABL. In contrast to the 2 days or longer required for conventional hybridization, HPA analysis can be completed in less than 30 minutes. We have successfully used this method to analyze 60 leukemia samples (34 from Ph1-negative acute leukemias; 6 from Ph1-positive acute leukemias; and 20 from CML) with complete correlation (of BCR-ABL positivity or negativity) with the results of karyotype or Southern Blot analysis of genomic DNA for bcr rearrangement.

However, this packaging is not as efficient as the packaging of RNA encoded by a standard avian retroviral vector. A quail cell line containing a Rous sarcoma virus mutant, SE21Q1b, produces virions which will package endogenous cellular mRNAs randomly, roughly in proportion to their intracellular concentrations. We found that viral particles from SE21Q1b retain the capacity to specifically encapsidate hygromycin mRNAs containing the avian psi+. To determine whether packaging of cellular mRNA would occur in other retroviral packaging lines, we assayed virion RNA isolated from the retroviral particles produced by avian and murine packaging lines for the presence of endogenous cellular mRNAs. Endogenous cellular mRNAs were not found randomly packaged into virions produced by any of the packaging lines examined except SE21Q1b. Some specific sequences, however, were found packaged into avian virions.

Rex-II acts posttranscriptionally by inducing the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced viral mRNAs that encode the Gag and Env structural proteins and the enzymes derived from the pol gene. We now define a 295-nucleotide cis-acting regulatory element within the 3' long terminal repeat of HTLV-II that is required for the effects of Rex-II. This Rex-II response element (RexIIRE) corresponds to a predicted, highly stable RNA secondary structure and functions when present in the sense but not in the antisense orientation. The RexIIRE confers responsiveness not only to Rex-II but also to the Rex protein of HTLV-I. Deletion and substitution mutagenesis of the RexIIRE permitted identification of a small subregion within the larger element critically required for Rex-II responsiveness and further suggested that the structurally distinct RexIIREs generated from the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats of HTLV-II may differentially regulate the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced gag-pol and singly spliced env mRNAs. While the Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 fails to function via the RexIIRE, the Rex-II protein, like Rex-I, can functionally replace the Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 via its interaction with the Rev response element (RevRE).","['Kim, J H', 'Kaufman, P A', 'Hanly, S M', 'Rimsky, L T', 'Greene, W C']","['Kim JH', 'Kaufman PA', 'Hanly SM', 'Rimsky LT', 'Greene WC']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genes, pX', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.1.405-414.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Jan;65(1):405-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.1.405-414.1991.,,PMC240531,"['1K11 AI00950-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5 K11 CA01458-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Replacement with the fragment of F-SFFVP env containing the 585-bp deletion, the 6-bp duplication, and the single-base insertion converted the resulting chimeric genome so that the mutant had a pathogenic activity like that of F-SFFVP. Replacement with the fragment containing only the 585-bp deletion did not result in a pathogenic virus. However, when this virus pseudotyped by Friend murine leukemia virus was passaged in newborn DBA/2 mice, we could recover weakly pathogenic viruses with a high frequency. Molecular analysis of the genome of the recovered virus revealed the presence of a single-base insertion in the same T5 stretch where the wild-type F-SFFV env has the single-base insertion. These results provided evidence that the unique genomic structures present in the 3' half of F-SFFV env are the sole determinants that distinguish the pathogenicity of F-SFFV from that of Friend mink cell focus-forming virus. The importance of the dualtropic env-specific sequence present in the 5' half of F-SFFV env for the pathogenic activity was evaluated by constructing a mutant F-SFFV genome in which this sequence was replaced by the ecotropic env sequence of Friend murine leukemia virus and by examining its pathogenicity. The results indicated that the dualtropic env-specific sequence was essential to pathogenic activity.","['Watanabe, N', 'Nishi, M', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Amanuma, H']","['Watanabe N', 'Nishi M', 'Ikawa Y', 'Amanuma H']","['Laboratory of Gene Technology and Safety, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Genes, env', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Plasmids', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.1.132-137.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Jan;65(1):132-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.1.132-137.1991.,['env'],PMC240497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients were considered assessable. The response rate was 44% (eight complete remissions [CRs], four partial remissions [PRs]). Median duration of postchemotherapy neutropenia was 36 days (range, 18 to 45). Therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity was mainly hematologic and nondose-limiting. Despite prolonged neutropenia, severe infections were rarely seen, and most patients were managed as outpatients. Twelve patients had nausea and vomiting, two had symptomatic hypomagnesemia, and one patient showed reversible ototoxicity. Because of substantial antileukemic activity and unusual extrahematologic toxicity, CBDCA appears to be an effective second-line agent in the treatment of ANLL and should be considered for upgrading to first-line treatment regimens.","['Martinez, J A', 'Martin, G', 'Sanz, G F', 'Sempere, A', 'Jarque, I', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Sanz, M A']","['Martinez JA', 'Martin G', 'Sanz GF', 'Sempere A', 'Jarque I', 'de la Rubia J', 'Sanz MA']","['Hematology Service, Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.1.39 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Jan;9(1):39-43. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.1.39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over half of the RT group had somnolence syndrome, and four developed cerebral calcifications late in their clinical course. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) were seen in 15 patients in the MTX group, and six had early, transient white-matter hypodensities apparent on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Mean scores on standard tests of intelligence and academic achievement, administered after remission induction and again at a median of 6 years after treatment cessation, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, statistically significant decreases in overall and verbal intelligence quotients (IQs) and in arithmetic achievement were found within both treatment groups. Sixteen of 26 in the MTX group and 14 of the 23 in the RT group had clinically important decreases (greater than or equal to 15 points) on one or more neuropsychologic measures. These changes did not correlate with findings on CT scans, EEGs, or other clinical signs of neurotoxicity.

Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions.

On the other hand, leukemia showed a drug resistance in three (21%) of the former patients and in four (80%) of the latter patients. One patient in each group died during induction. Generally, older ANLL patients have an inferior CR rate after chemotherapy and a poor prognosis. This has been explained by the facts that the risk of induction death increases and that specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis are considerably more frequent in older patients. Our data may indicate, however, that in ANLL with normal karyotype older patients show a low initial response rate because of drug resistance.","['Nakamura, H', 'Sadamori, N', 'Sasagawa, I', 'Itoyama, T', 'Tokunaga, S', 'Mine, M', 'Ichimaru, M']","['Nakamura H', 'Sadamori N', 'Sasagawa I', 'Itoyama T', 'Tokunaga S', 'Mine M', 'Ichimaru M']","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Aging/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90010-R [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90010-r [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Jan;51(1):67-71. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90010-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I propose a model of leukemogenic process in ATL based on our cytogenetic data and molecular results in the literature. It seems that the rearrangement of some proto-oncogene and alpha-chain gene of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR-alpha) is necessary for the development to overt ATL. A deficiency in the rearrangement of proto-oncogene to TCR-alpha may result in only a minor proliferation of abnormal lymphocytes and remain in the preleukemic state of ATL or in the HTLV-I carrier state.","['Sadamori, N']",['Sadamori N'],"['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90019-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90019-q [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Jan;51(1):131-6. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90019-q.,,,,,,,39,,,,,,,,,

Although a variable phenotype makes accurate diagnosis on the basis of clinical manifestations difficult in some patients, the unique sensitivity of FA cells to the clastogenic effect of DNA cross-linking agents such as diepoxybutane (DEB) can be used to facilitate the diagnosis. We review all cases of FA reported to have leukemia, preleukemia, or a bone marrow (BM) clonal chromosomal abnormality and include for the first time an analysis of these conditions observed in patients in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). The incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in FA patients is more than 15,000 times that observed in children in the general population. Cytogenetic studies of FA-associated leukemias disclose a high frequency of monosomy 7 and duplications involving 1q. There were no occurrences of t(8;21), t(15;17), or abnormalities of 11q, which are associated with M2, M3, and M5 leukemias, respectively, but not with preleukemia. Development of leukemia in FA patients was associated with an exceedingly poor prognosis, with a mean age of death of 15 years. We suggest that all FA patients may be considered preleukemic and that this disorder presents a model for study of the etiology of AML.","['Auerbach, A D', 'Allen, R G']","['Auerbach AD', 'Allen RG']","['Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021-6399.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Preleukemia/*etiology', 'Registries']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90002-C [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90002-c [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Jan;51(1):1-12. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90002-c.,,,"['HL 32987/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00102/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,92,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide demonstrates remarkable schedule dependency. A randomized comparison has shown an impressive survival difference for patients with extensive SCLC receiving a 5-day course versus those receiving a 1-day course. Because of these and previous clinical and laboratory data, etoposide is now given intravenously or orally in a 3-day to 5-day schedule. It is generally accepted that approximately 50% of the orally administered drug is absorbed. The authors have initiated several etoposide studies using an extended administration schedule, believing that a prolonged schedule may be superior to the standard 3-day to 5-day schedule. This was initially tested in a Phase I study. Results showed that etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) given over 21 days was feasible and was associated with only moderate toxicity. Several Phase II studies have been completed or are nearing completion, including studies in patients with SCLC, NHL, germ cell tumors, soft tissue sarcoma, renal carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Responses have been seen in all of these groups, particularly in patients with SCLC, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. In these groups we saw responses in patients who were clearly resistant to etoposide plus cisplatin given in a standard schedule or in some patients who were resistant to high-dose etoposide with bone marrow transplantation. Investigators at Indiana University Medical Center who studied oral etoposide in a similar fashion in patients with advanced germ cell tumors and SCLC achieved results similar to those reported here. The authors have initiated a number of combination chemotherapy programs using the chronic oral form of etoposide. These include patients with SCLC, non-small cell lung cancer, and elderly patients with high-grade and intermediate forms of NHL. In addition, chronic intravenous oral etoposide is being used in salvage approaches for patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and recurrent resistant intermediate-grade and high-grade NHL. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggest that a 50-mg/m2 oral dose is highly bioavailable (91% to 96%).

The drug has been safely combined with cytarabine, azacytidine, vinca alkaloids, and anthracyclines, inducing remission rates of 20% to 60% in patients with previously treated AML. The experience with etoposide in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is less extensive, but the drug seems to be active in combination with cytarabine or aclacinomycin. In addition, etoposide is combined with cytarabine and anthracyclines for the primary treatment of AML. The response rates thus achieved are comparable with those obtained with standard regimens. A Phase I/II trial was initiated to study the efficacy of the NOVE combination (mitoxantrone [10 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 5] plus etoposide [100 mg/m2/d for 3, 4, or 5 days] in patients with refractory AML. The results showed that extended duration of etoposide administration is associated with higher CR rates. Overall, a CR rate of 43% was achieved in 61 patients. A sequential regimen with IDAC (idarubicin/cytarabine) and NOVE was designed for primary treatment of adult patients with AML. Cycles of IDAC or NOVE are applied depending on response. The results of the pilot study with this strategy were encouraging with 18 of 20 patients achieving CR. Further studies are under way to verify the efficacy of this strategy.","['Ho, A D', 'Brado, B', 'Haas, R', 'Hunstein, W']","['Ho AD', 'Brado B', 'Haas R', 'Hunstein W']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, West Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910101)67:1+<281::aid-cncr2820671312>3.0.co;2-h [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Jan 1;67(1 Suppl):281-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910101)67:1+<281::aid-cncr2820671312>3.0.co;2-h.,,,,,,,33,,,,,,,,,

Its activity in tumors such as lymphoma and leukemia, as well as solid tumors, identifies etoposide as a highly important chemotherapeutic agent. Cellular and animal models have shown that the cell kill and tumor response depend on both dose and time of exposure. Recent clinical studies again show that dose and schedule of etoposide can have important effects on clinical response to the drug.

Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs, filtration of RBCs appears rational, but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors, both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration.","['van Marwijk Kooy, M', 'van Prooijen, H C', 'Moes, M', 'Bosma-Stants, I', 'Akkerman, J W']","['van Marwijk Kooy M', 'van Prooijen HC', 'Moes M', 'Bosma-Stants I', 'Akkerman JW']","['Department of Immuno-Hematology, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79606-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jan 1;77(1):201-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six patients (30%) developed clinical evidence of venocclusive disease and seven patients (35%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease involving the liver, but the incidence of these complications was similar to that expected among patients who are not carriers of HBsAg. Three patients died with hepatorenal failure, but all three had venocclusive disease and the contribution of HBV infection to liver failure was unclear. Available liver specimens obtained at autopsy (six patients) or biopsy (two patients) all showed either HBsAg (one specimen) or hepatitis B core antigen (four specimens) or both (three specimens) by immunoperoxidase staining.

This disease syndrome is characterized by development of spongiform encephalomyelopathy resulting in hindlimb paralysis, generalized bodywasting, and marked thymic atrophy associated with immune deficiency. The viral genetic determinants responsible for hindlimb paralysis in BALB/c and CFW/D mice have been localized to two point mutations in the env gene: one results in a Val-25----IIe substitution in the envelope precursor polyprotein gPr80env and the other, in an Arg-430----Lys substitution in the gp70. In this report we present studies showing that FVB/N mice were highly susceptible to ts1 and exhibited the shortest and most uniform latency period of all the murine strains tested. In addition, we have found that, unlike in CFW/D and BALB/c mice, only the Val-25----IIe substitution in the gPr80env is required to induce hindlimb paralysis in FVB/N mice. Our studies show that there was enhanced replication of ts1 in all tissues of FVB/N mice and that the virus titer in the spinal cord was more than 10-fold higher in FVB/N than in BALB/c mice by 30 days postinoculation, when the clinical signs of paralysis became evident in FVB/N mice.

Since 1985 we have been asked to consult in the treatment of 18 patients with cancer and with DVT and/or PE, and we have placed a GF in each of these patients. This represented 34% (18/53) of the filters placed during that same period. Over the same 4-year period, 11 patients with cancer and DVT and/or PE underwent anticoagulation therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of anticoagulation versus GF insertion in these two groups of patients. A significantly higher number of major complications (n = 4) occurred in the anticoagulation group (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test) than in the GF group (n = 0). The four complications that occurred in the anticoagulation group included three bleeding episodes (tumor bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hip hematoma) and one PE, despite adequate anticoagulation. Two patients died as a direct result of these complications (PE and gastrointestinal bleeding). The three patients with bleeding complications each required a transfusion of more than 3 units of blood. All four of the patients with complications had metastatic disease (pancreatic carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate carcinoma, and uterine carcinoma). Although this is a small, nonrandomized, nonprospective study, the data seem to indicate that GF placement is safer than anticoagulation for DVT or PE in patients with cancer and particularly in patients with metastatic disease. We conclude that GF insertions may be a better primary treatment than anticoagulation.","['Cohen, J R', 'Tenenbaum, N', 'Citron, M']","['Cohen JR', 'Tenenbaum N', 'Citron M']","['Department of Surgery, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY 11042.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,['0 (Anticoagulants)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pulmonary Embolism/complications/*therapy', 'Thrombophlebitis/complications/*therapy', '*Vena Cava Filters']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Surgery. 1991 Jan;109(1):12-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies have shown that c-fes can transform fibroblasts if sufficient levels of gene expression are achieved. These findings indicate that strict regulation of the c-fes gene is critical to normal myeloid development, whereas elevated c-fes expression may contribute to malignant transformation. In the present study, we compared the c-fes messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in leukemia blasts from patients with myeloid or lymphoid leukemia with those of peripheral monocytes from a normal donor with the use of a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay. The presence of c-fes mRNA was readily detected in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, but c-fes mRNA was present in low levels or was absent in lymphoid leukemia cells. The leukemia cells of two of five AML patients and four of four CML patients expressed more c-fes mRNA than monocytes from a normal donor, with more than a threefold elevation in the cells of one CML patient. No evidence of amplification or rearrangement of the c-fes gene was detectable by Southern blot analysis of myeloid leukemia DNA, suggesting that the variation in c-fes mRNA levels are related to differences in transcriptional activity and/or message stability. These results indicate that elevated c-fes expression is a common feature of myeloid leukemia cells that could potentially contribute to the leukemia phenotype.","['Smithgall, T E', 'Johnston, J B', 'Bustin, M', 'Glazer, R I']","['Smithgall TE', 'Johnston JB', 'Bustin M', 'Glazer RI']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism']",1991/01/02 00:00,1991/01/02 00:01,['1991/01/02 00:00'],"['1991/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/83.1.42 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1991 Jan 2;83(1):42-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/83.1.42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanisms of the leukemogenic process are unknown, the tax gene may have a role in this process. Because clustering occurs with HTLV-I and ATL, members of ATL families were examined for antibodies to the tax protein and compared with matched HTLV-I-positive blood donors. To investigate the antibody response to this protein, a plasmid, pBHX-4, was constructed to express a recombinant tax protein (r-tax). For ATL patients and their HTLV-I antibody-positive blood relatives, the rate of seroreactivity with the r-tax protein was 67.3% (35/52), compared with 51.6% (97/188) for HTLV-I antibody-positive control blood donors (P less than .05). The difference between direct offspring of ATL patients and matched HTLV-I blood donors was even greater (84.2% [16/91] vs. 44.2% [42/95]; P less than .005). Thus, tax antibody positivity in direct offspring of ATL patients may reflect differences in time or route of HTLV-I infection. Alternatively, it might reflect genetic differences in host susceptibility or virus strain.","['Okayama, A', 'Chen, Y M', 'Tachibana, N', 'Shioiri, S', 'Lee, T H', 'Tsuda, K', 'Essex, M']","['Okayama A', 'Chen YM', 'Tachibana N', 'Shioiri S', 'Lee TH', 'Tsuda K', 'Essex M']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', '*Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Plasmids', 'Prevalence', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/infdis/163.1.47 [doi]'],ppublish,J Infect Dis. 1991 Jan;163(1):47-52. doi: 10.1093/infdis/163.1.47.,['tax'],,"['CA-38450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'H1-33774/PHS HHS/United States', 'HL-43560/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After pulse exposure of human normal quiescent or proliferating lymphocytes, human lymphocytic leukemic MOLT cells, and mice leukemic L1210 cells to 10 micrograms/ml of R123, the dye release was studied using flow cytometry. Two distinct phases of R123 release, each following first-order kinetics, were apparent; the half-time of retention for the rapidly and slowly released fractions of R123 was 0.8-1.1 and 2.8-4.2 h, respectively. Simultaneous supravital cell staining with R123 and Hoechst 33342 made it possible to correlate retention of R123 with cell position in the cell cycle. No significant differences were observed in the rate of R123 release from cells in G1 vs S or vs G2 + M phases of the cycle. The data rule out a possibility that the release of R123 is due to periodic depolarization of the mitochondria in the cell as may be postulated by cell cycle models that assume a transient passage of cells through resting phase following division. The observed similar rates of R123 release regardless of cell type or cell cycle phase suggest that the factors affecting the exchange are similar in normal lymphocytes vs leukemic cells and unrelated to cell proliferation rate or phase of the cell cycle. Two distinct rates of R123 release indicate the presence of two kinds of binding sites differing in affinity to the dye.","['Myc, A', 'DeAngelis, P', 'Kimmel, M', 'Melamed, M R', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Myc A', 'DeAngelis P', 'Kimmel M', 'Melamed MR', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",IM,,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(91)90176-U [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90176-u [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Jan;192(1):198-202. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90176-u.,,,"['R01 CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In prior experiments, we have tested the toxicity and antiviral efficacy of castanospermine in mice infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV). When compared with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine), castanospermine was less effective and more toxic. Since the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine was previously found to have a more favorable activity profile than the parent compound against HIV-1 in cultured cells, we compared the antiviral efficacy of both compounds in parallel in vitro and in vivo in the RLV system. Plaque formation in the XC assay was inhibited with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 microM for the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine, as compared to 9 microM for castanospermine. For both compounds, concentrations resulting in significant cytotoxicity were about ten times higher. Both compounds significantly decreased HIV-1 env-induced syncytium formation in a novel in vitro assay. In RLV-exposed mice, the 6-O-butanoyl analog showed no advantage over the parent compound: both curves for toxicity as well as antiviral efficacy were super-imposable. We conclude that the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine as well as castanospermine itself are active antiviral agents in mice and that prolonged oral administration is tolerable.

The encouraging results observed for Group III patients prompted us to propose ABSCT for patients in chronic phase with initial prognostic factors (high-risk CML) suggesting that IFN will not be effective if administered as front-line therapy. To date, 13 patients with high-risk CML underwent ABSCT followed by IFN therapy. Ten patients achieved a complete hematological response following transplantation. Two of 6 evaluable patients had a cytogenetical response 6 months after ABSCT.

Though their function in normal conditions remains obscure, autologous CSC seem capable of restoring hemopoiesis after myeloablative treatment. With cell separators CSC may be harvested in adequate number, and collection may be further improved giving chemotherapy and/or GM-CSF that mobilize stem cells into the circulation. Due to the high number of progenitor cells infused, hematologic reconstitution is more rapid with CSC than with marrow cells. Autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ABSCT) is increasingly employed in a variety of hematologic malignancies and in some solid tumors. CSC allow transplantation in patients previously irradiated on the sites of harvest or with marrow tumor involvement, and probably decrease the risk of infection by shortening the duration of post-graft aplasia. Their use is also encouraged by a belief that, along with CSC, a large number of immunocompetent cells are infused that may exert an anti-tumor effect. A lower tumor contamination of CSC as compared to marrow is an attractive matter, but remains to be demonstrated. Standardization of cell cloning assays, identification of monoclonal antibodies to recognize the surface antigens expressed on progenitor cells, and definition of advantages of ABSCT are items of future work.","['Majolino, I', 'Scime, R', 'Indovina, A']","['Majolino I', 'Scime R', 'Indovina A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale V.

In a culture assay in semi-solid medium with a mixture of normal marrow and 1% HL60 cells, a lysis of clonogenic cells greater than 99% was achieved with the three antibodies and two rounds of complement, or with antibody-coated magnetic beads. Cultures of leukemic clonogenic cells (CFU-L) were performed in 47 cases.

Twenty cases were purged with antibody-coated beads. An inhibition equal to or greater than 90% was observed in 10 cases with VIM-D5, 11 cases with 8.27 and 12 cases with SMY15A.

The most obvious immunological defect in HIV infection is a reduction in CD4+ cell numbers and an inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio. To determine whether the same is true in FIV infection, we analyzed by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to feline lymphocyte populations the CD4:CD8 ratios in cats naturally infected with the virus. We report that 13 of 19 FIV-infected cats had ratios below the 5th percentile of normal cats (0.57, established from analysis of 39 normal cats) and 18 of 19 had ratios below 1. Repeated analyses over a period of several months revealed the inverted ratios to be consistent. Analysis of lymphocyte numbers in FIV-infected cats shows that the inverted ratios are due to a decrease in CD4+ T cells, while CD8+ T and B cells remain relatively normal in number. Analysis of a group of cats with a variety of other chronic diseases, including feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections, revealed a near-normal distribution of CD4:CD8 ratios. These findings are similar to those in HIV infections and indicate that, like HIV, FIV causes a selective reduction in CD4+ cells and should be an excellent model for studying retrovirus-induced AIDS.","['Novotney, C', 'English, R V', 'Housman, J', 'Davidson, M G', 'Nasisse, M P', 'Jeng, C R', 'Davis, W C', 'Tompkins, M B']","['Novotney C', 'English RV', 'Housman J', 'Davidson MG', 'Nasisse MP', 'Jeng CR', 'Davis WC', 'Tompkins MB']","['Department of Companion Animal and Special Species Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27606.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cats', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-199012000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 1990 Dec;4(12):1213-8. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199012000-00005.,,,['CA-43676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection rate for cancer screening was much greater than with any standard diagnostic tests. When imaging was performed using the BDORT, the area of positive response to the cancer positive slide was often much greater than the actual size of the cancer itself. This was due to the fact that most of the cancer tissue of the lungs or digestive system contained viruses such as HTLV-3 (often found in adenocarcinoma of the lung, stomach, head of pancreas, and colon) or HTLV-1 (often found in small-cell carcinoma of the lung and certain types of leukemia). The extent of the virus positive area was often far greater than that of the cancer tissue itself and was distributed in a much greater area surrounding the cancer. For this reason, the virus alone showed a response which could be mistaken for cancer tissue. The author succeeded in differentiating the exact location of cancer tissue itself from surrounding cancer related virus (with or without other microbes) positive area by using a pair of identical microscope slides with the same cancer tissue. One of the slides was exposed to ultra-violet rays (peak wavelength of 253.7 nm mercury vapor atomic resonance spectral line) for 40 seconds-4 minutes. After this exposure, the BDORT response to the virus (with or without other microbes) associated with the cancer tissue was completely eliminated, while the response to the cancer tissue was maintained. Using an ultraviolet exposed cancer slide, the imaging of the part of the body which responded to this virus-free cancer slide indicated the actual location of the cancer tissue, which was often confirmed by standard X-ray or other imaging methods when the thickness of the tumor was relatively large. These cancers detectable by standard laboratory tests had strikingly weakening response to the BDORT (-3.5 and -4), with ultra-violet exposed cancer slide as well as for antibody of Oncogen C-fos. The smallest size of cancer tissue detected by this method was less than 1mm in diameter in the very early stage of the cancer, which usually cannot be detected by current laboratory tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Omura, Y']",['Omura Y'],"['Heart Disease Research Foundation, New York, N.Y.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Acupunct Electrother Res,Acupuncture & electro-therapeutics research,7610364,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Microscopy, Ultraviolet', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/036012990816358135 [doi]'],ppublish,Acupunct Electrother Res. 1990;15(3-4):217-33. doi: 10.3727/036012990816358135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neurites of K-ras infected PC12 cells, filled with microtubules and actin which was concentrated within the growth cones, resembled those of primary neurons in vitro. As in the NGF-primed PC12 cells, two types of secretory vesicles were present in the K-ras-infected PC12 neurites: large (100 nm), dense core granules, and small (45 nm), clear vesicles. Compared to naive PC12 cells, K-ras infected PC12 cells had (a) higher activities of acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase, two enzymes involved in acetylcholine metabolism; (b) enhanced activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis; (c) a higher, evoked norepinephrine release; and (d) similar levels of sodium-dependent uptake of both choline and norepinephrine. Although the total content of catecholamines in K-ras-differentiated PC12 cells was less than that of naive cells, both norepinephrine and dopamine were present in substantial amounts and norepinephrine was released after stimulation.

No acute hemolysis occurred after marrow infusion. Myeloid and megakaryocytic series engrafted promptly. However, delayed erythropoiesis up to day 266 was found. Prolonged presence of anti-A antibody was noted for more than 250 days after BMT, although the peak titer was only 1:8. After the reconstitution of bone marrow, the erythroid series was confirmed as donor origin (RBC cell typing A). It is proposed that the prolonged presence of anti-A antibody probably produced from the residual host B lymphocytes, would destroy the regenerating erythroid precursors.

The chemical structures of the two major hydroxylated metabolites were determined by mass spectrometry (fast atom bombardment and desorption chemical ionization) and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. One was a taxol derivative hydroxylated on the phenyl group at C3' of the side chain at C13, while the other corresponded to a taxol derivative hydroxylated in the m-position on the benzoate of the side chain at C2.

This transmembrane glycoprotein acts like an energy dependent efflux pump which possesses a broad specificity. It seems to be acting as a pump requiring drug fixation prior to extrusion. With the aim of investigating which parameters influence the recognition of drugs by the MDR system, we have determined the toxicities of different drugs on human and murine sensitive and resistant cell lines. For this purpose we have isolated and characterized a human adriamycin-resistant cell line, CEM/Adr, which presents an MDR phenotype. The tested drugs were ellipticine and olivacine derivatives which differ through discrete lateral chain substitutions. The influence of lateral chain lipophilicity and nitrogen quaternarization on drug recognition was studied. Small modifications in the chemical structure of the drugs have induced large changes in their toxicities and in the cross-resistance levels of the MDR cells to the tested compounds. The cross-resistances of the murine and human cells to the various compounds were strikingly different.

The clinical course and blood pictures in one case resembled leukemia of megakaryocyte lineage (M7), but results of marker studies of the blast cells ruled out the possibility of M7.

S100 beta TLC were obtained from the peripheral blood of a patient with S100 beta-positive T-cell leukemia and enriched by an E-rosetting method. Two dimensional flow cytometric analysis indicated that the vast majority of the E-positive fraction were S100 beta TLC expressing CD3 and CD8 antigens. Although S100 beta TLC expressed CD3 antigen, they were negative for the alpha/beta and gamma/delta T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) defined by monoclonal antibodies (mabs) WT-31 and delta TCS-1, respectively. It was speculated that S100 beta TLC initially expressed alpha/beta TCR but lost it during malignant transformation. When S100 beta TLC were cultured for 24 h, they acquired cytotoxic activity towards various NK-sensitive cell lines including K-562, Molt-3 and CEM-CCLF, but did not exhibit lysing activity towards NK-resistant cell lines including Raji, Daudi and MT-1. Despite the NK-activity of cultured S100 beta TLC, they lacked the morphological features of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). S100 beta TLC did not exhibit lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity. When S100 beta TLC were cocultivated with NK-sensitive cells or NK-resistant cells, they selectively bound to NK-sensitive cells, indicating that they lysed target cells by cell-to-cell contact. The finding that S100 beta TLC lacked TCR molecules and their NK activity was not inhibited by mabs reactive with the CD3-TCR complex indicated that the CD3-TCR complex was not involved in their target recognition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Takahashi, K', 'Yoshino, T', 'Akagi, T', 'Miyatani, K', 'Hayashi, K', 'Sonobe, H', 'Ohtsuki, Y']","['Takahashi K', 'Yoshino T', 'Akagi T', 'Miyatani K', 'Hayashi K', 'Sonobe H', 'Ohtsuki Y']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

Taxol is derived from the bark of the western yew. It promotes the formation of microtubule bundles which deform the cytoskeleton and interfere with mitosis. Although phase II efficacy testing is incomplete, taxol is effective in the treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma and has some activity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. It remains untested against several other neoplasms. The chief toxicities of taxol are myelosuppression, mucositis, anaphylactoid reactions, and peripheral neuropathy. Homoharringtonine is the most active and abundant of the cephalotaxine esters derived from the genus Cephalotaxus. This agent appears to act at the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis and has clinical activity in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The dose limiting toxicities of homoharringtonine are hypotension and myelosuppression. SKF 104864 and CPT-11 are derivatives of camptothecin which are still in early clinical trials. They are cytotoxic in vitro, acting through an interaction with topoisomerase I to induce DNA fragmentation. The spectra of activity and toxicity of SKF 104864 and CPT-11 are still undefined.

Leukaemic cells were morphologically typical, expressed a T-cell CD4+ phenotype, did not display any helper functions, and grew in vitro under supply of exogenous interleukin-2. Antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) were found in the serum, and the virus was isolated from leukaemic cells. The family members who could be tested were seronegative.

It has been shown that multidrug resistance (MDR) is frequently related to the expression of a membrane glycoprotein (P-170). This protein is able to bind ATP and leads to decreased accumulation of structurally unrelated antineoplastic drugs extensively used in the management of hematological patients. The availability of monoclonal antibodies and probes allowed extensive studies both ""in vitro"" and ""in vivo"" of the protein structure and of its mechanism of action. The P 170 activity may be antagonized by drugs able to compete with chemotherapic agents for the binding or by calcium antagonists that inhibit the expulsion activity of the protein. P 170 has been found in variable percentages of several hematological malignancies such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloma and lymphoma. The reported data seem to indicate that the patients carrying P 170-positive neoplastic cells should be treated with drugs that are not bound by the protein. However, the possibility of inhibiting the protein function and the recent reports suggesting the use of P 170 as a target for immunotoxins could be the basis for new therapeutic protocols.","['Carulli, G', 'Petrini, M']","['Carulli G', 'Petrini M']","['Servizio di Ematologia, Clinica Medica I, Universita, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'DNA/genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/therapeutic use']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1990 Jul-Aug;75(4):363-74.,,,,,,,97,,,,,,,,,

These receptors were uncoupled from adenylate cyclase due to the absence of Gs. The catalytical unit was directly stimulated by MnCl2, forskolin, and even more markedly in the simultaneous presence of both reagents. In contrast, the enzyme was inhibited in the presence of Gpp[NH]p, probably through interaction with Gi. Indeed, this inhibitory effect was constrained by preincubating cells in the presence of pertussis toxin and a 41 kDa protein was specifically ADP-ribosylated in the presence of the toxin. This cell line was therefore analogous to the Cyc- cell line derived from the murine S49 lymphoma cell line. When added to the culture medium, butyrate (2 mM) induced beta 2-adrenoceptors, the expression of these uncoupled receptors depending on protein synthesis, as judged by inhibitory effects of cycloheximide. In contrast, dBcAMP (1 mM) and TPA (tumor-promoting agent phorbol ester) increased the rate of disappearance of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Butyrate, dBcAMP and TPA systematically decreased adenylate cyclase activity. Besides, TPA (but neither butyrate nor dBcAMP) reduced the efficacy of Gpp[NH]p in inhibiting adenylate cyclase, suggesting a proportionately higher alteration of Gi. We conclude that beta 2-adrenoceptors, uncoupled from adenylate cyclase, are regulated independently from the catalytical unit and Gi, in this Cyc- T lymphoma cell line.","['Buscail, L', 'Robberecht, P', 'DeNeef, P', 'Bui, D N', 'Hooghe, R', 'Christophe, J']","['Buscail L', 'Robberecht P', 'DeNeef P', 'Bui DN', 'Hooghe R', 'Christophe J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Medical School, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)', '0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Adrenergic beta-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*drug effects', 'Second Messenger Systems/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(11)80165-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(11)80165-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1990 Aug;181(1):51-63. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(11)80165-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry analyses of spleen and lymph nodes from susceptible C57BL/6 mice infected with this virus mixture revealed the presence in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes of a previously unrecognized subset of CD4+CD3+ T cells that are Thy-1-. The frequency of these cells increased with progression of disease, eventually comprising between 30% and 50% of all CD4+ cells. Infection of A/J mice, a strain which is genetically resistant to development of MAIDS, did not induce an increase of this T cell population, indicating that infection with the virus mixture was insufficient to induce its proliferation. A central role for the defective virus in this process was suggested by the finding that C57BL/6 mice infected with LP-BM5 eco alone did not have increased frequencies of Thy-1-CD4+ cells in spleen. Studies of spleen and peripheral lymph node cells from normal mice demonstrated the presence of Thy-1-CD4+ cells at frequencies of 1%-2%.

These results suggest that MRK16 of IgG2a subtype may be a useful therapeutic agent in eradication of drug-resistant cancer cells expressing P-glycoprotein through ADCC reaction.","['Heike, Y', 'Hamada, H', 'Inamura, N', 'Sone, S', 'Ogura, T', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Heike Y', 'Hamada H', 'Inamura N', 'Sone S', 'Ogura T', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Carcinoma/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02528.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Nov;81(11):1155-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02528.x.,,PMC5917982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The order of potency of peptides on both parameters was: helodermin greater than (acetyl-His1)VIP greater than (Phe1)VIP = VIP greater than PHI while secretin was ineffective. In membranes, when Gs was permanently activated by Gpp(NH)p or by ADP-ribosylation (after pretreating intact lymphoblasts for 2 h with cholera toxin), there resulted a variably increased affinity of receptors for VIP-like peptides, suggesting reduced receptor selectivity. Preexposing intact lymphoblasts to the same peptides induced, within 5 min, homologous desensitization (i.e. reduced binding capacity and even more so impaired capability to activate adenylate cyclase), whose extent correlated with the Kd of each peptide at time 0. After prolonged (16 h) exposure to 30 nM VIP that resulted in marked (75%) downregulation, 60% of the adenylate cyclase responsiveness could recover within 30-120 min even in the presence of cycloheximide, but further resensitization was cycloheximide-sensitive. To conclude, VIP receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase showed distinct specificity in human SUP-T1 lymphoblasts. Their specificity decreased when Gs was permanently activated. In intact cells exposed to VIP-like peptides, the receptors were rapidly desensitized, then down-regulated, the resensitization mechanism being not immediately inhibited by cycloheximide.","['Christophe, J', 'Cauvin, A', 'Vervisch, E', 'Buscail, L', 'Damien, C', 'Abello, J', 'Gourlet, P', 'Robberecht, P']","['Christophe J', 'Cauvin A', 'Vervisch E', 'Buscail L', 'Damien C', 'Abello J', 'Gourlet P', 'Robberecht P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Medical School, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Digestion,Digestion,0150472,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Gastrointestinal Hormone)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '89468-62-2 (heliodermin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemistry/pathology', 'Receptors, Gastrointestinal Hormone/analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide', 'Species Specificity', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000200378 [doi]'],ppublish,Digestion. 1990;46 Suppl 2:148-55. doi: 10.1159/000200378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other evidence has suggested that diminished net drug uptake in multidrug resistant (MDR) cells is due to decreased drug binding as well. To assess the contribution of binding differences to net drug accumulation and retention in MDR cells, mitoxantrone and vinblastine, two agents commonly associated with the MDR phenotype but with different mechanisms of action and intracellular binding sites, were studied in P388 murine leukemia cells. For both drugs, resistance was associated with a marked reduction in tightly bound drug which can account for the diminished net drug accumulation in this cell line; even at 1 microM vinblastine when the exchangeable component was one-half that of the sensitive cells, the nonexchangeable component was only one-seventh. For mitoxantrone, the exchangeable drug component was greater in resistant cells at low drug levels (1 microM) and similar at high drug levels (10 microM). For vinblastine, the exchangeable drug component was decreased in the resistant cells at 1 microM, but the difference compared to sensitive cells became neglible at 10 microM. The data indicate that diminished net drug uptake in the P388 MDR cell line was associated with a marked decrease in tightly bound, i.e. nonexchangeable, drug fractions for both mitoxantrone and vinblastine. Therefore, alterations in intracellular binding are in important factor in the decreased cellular uptake and retention of drugs in the multidrug resistance phenomenon. The relationship between these changes and the P170 efflux pump requires further clarification.","['Pincus, R', 'Goldman, I D']","['Pincus R', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', '*Drug Resistance', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Mitoxantrone/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*metabolism']",1990/12/15 00:00,1990/12/15 00:01,['1990/12/15 00:00'],"['1990/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(90)90580-E [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90580-e [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Dec 15;40(12):2625-35. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90580-e.,,,"['5 R35 CA39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 HL07110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No high-level resistant mutants were isolated de novo; cells initially displayed low-level resistance to Adriamycin and etoposide. Two stepwise doublings of the drug concentration were needed before PC4 cells acquired vincristine resistance, but there was no detectable overexpression of mdr or a change in anthracycline uptake. In a subsequent doubling of Adriamycin concentration, the cells showed a further increase in resistance to all three drugs and now a decreased anthracycline accumulation. However, there was still no detectable increase in mdr expression as judged by Northern analysis of poly(A)+ enriched RNA and Western blot analysis of membrane proteins. Only after a fourth doubling of Adriamycin concentration did the cells demonstrate enhanced expression of mdr and P-glycoprotein. Equivalent mutants of C7D were selected, but generally at lower Adriamycin concentrations. Verapamil partially lowered resistance, but failed to restore parental susceptibility in any mutant; it caused an increased uptake in those mutants showing decreased anthracycline accumulation, including those that did not overexpress mdr. This study demonstrated different resistance phenotypes among mutants appearing spontaneously under stepwise drug selection; mutants with vincristine resistance and decreased anthracycline uptake preceded those associated with over-expression of P-glycoprotein.","['Slapak, C A', 'Daniel, J C', 'Levy, S B']","['Slapak CA', 'Daniel JC', 'Levy SB']","['Department of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1990/12/15 00:00,1990/12/15 00:01,['1990/12/15 00:00'],"['1990/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 15;50(24):7895-901.,,,"['5T32CA09429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-CA08774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lyons, Biochemistry, 28: 463-470, 1989). Using human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells growing in culture, TDHO and HDDP as the free acids have 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 32 microM and greater than 1000 microM, respectively, whereas for TDHO methyl ester, the IC50 value is 25 microM, and for HDDP dimethyl ester, the IC50 value is 21 microM. These IC50 values were not affected by addition of dihydroorotate, uridine, or deoxycytidine to the culture medium. TDHO methyl ester (25 microM) had only slight inhibitory effects upon the dihydroorotase reaction of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in growing leukemia cells, cells arrested in G2 + M phases of the cell cycle. At 250 microM TDHO methyl ester, analysis of cell extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography showed that after 4 h carbamyl aspartate had accumulated from undetectable levels to 760 microM, whereas UTP decreased from 580 to 110 microM and CTP from 350 to 86 microM, indicating inhibition of dihydroorotase in growing leukemia cells. IMP accumulated from 63 to 350 microM, total guanylates increased while adenylates decreased, and the adenylate energy charge decreased from 0.91 to 0.69 after 4 h. The cellular concentration of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate increased from 180 to 290 microM due to sparing from pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis resulting in complementary stimulation of the de novo purine pathway. HDDP dimethyl ester at concentrations of up to 250 microM had no discernable effect upon pyrimidine or purine nucleotide biosynthesis. At 25 microM HDDP-dimethyl ester, cells arrested in G2 + M phases initially, with accumulation of cells in G1/G0 at later times. These data suggest that the primary mechanisms of growth inhibition for TDHO and HDDP involve inhibition of cell cycle progression from late G2 or M phase to G1 phase and that blockade of the pyrimidine pathway by TDHO is a secondary effect found at higher concentrations.","['Brooke, J', 'Szabados, E', 'Lyons, S D', 'Goodridge, R J', 'Harsanyi, M C', 'Poiner, A', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Brooke J', 'Szabados E', 'Lyons SD', 'Goodridge RJ', 'Harsanyi MC', 'Poiner A', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '114832-72-3 (2-oxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylate)', '118438-67-8 (6-thiodihydroorotate)', '61H4T033E5 (Orotic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.2.3 (Dihydroorotase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Dihydroorotase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Orotic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1990/12/15 00:00,1990/12/15 00:01,['1990/12/15 00:00'],"['1990/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 15;50(24):7793-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The insertionally activated transcripts encode protein products that have constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and that can induce erythro-leukemia but not sarcomas. We have found that a single point mutation within the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain in this truncated molecule can increase the ability of this oncogene to induce anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts in vitro and fibrosarcoma formation in vivo. Associated with this increased transforming potential is a corresponding increase in the kinase activity of the mutant erbB protein product. The mutation, which converts a valine to isoleucine at position 157 of the insertionally activated c-erbB product, is at a residue that is highly conserved within the protein kinase family.

In the present report, the possible relationship of these two physiologic functions CLL B-cells was studied. The L system transport defect in CLL is restored by phorbol ester-induced cell maturation; following incubation with 0.15 microM tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) for 17 hours, the L system initial velocity showed a 20-fold increase.

Evidence for a drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II. Journal of Biological Chemistry 264:16411-16420; 1989). We now demonstrate that the variable XmnI digestion pattern represents a normal restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) which is observed in subjects without malignant disease and exhibits an autosomal pattern of inheritance. These data suggest that the previously described deviation in the genomic structure of topoisomerase II in the m-AMSA-resistant cell line did not reflect a new mutation, but rather a reduction to homozygosity at the topoisomerase II locus. This reduction to homozygosity is not due to chromosomal loss, as chromosome 17-specific gene probes clearly identify two chromosome 17's in the sensitive line and four in the resistant line, using chromosome painting with a chromosome 17-specific library. Some other genetic change must be the cause of the resistance of HL-60/AMSA and its topoisomerase II to the inhibiting actions of m-AMSA.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Mayes, J', 'Deisseroth, K', 'Hinds, M', 'Grant, G', 'Pathak, S', 'Ledley, F D', 'Vyas, R', 'Hittelman, W']","['Zwelling LA', 'Mayes J', 'Deisseroth K', 'Hinds M', 'Grant G', 'Pathak S', 'Ledley FD', 'Vyas R', 'Hittelman W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/physiology', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/095535490820874047 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1990;2(11):357-61. doi: 10.3727/095535490820874047.,,,"['CA27931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We mainly used MRK 16 monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactive with P-GP. P-GP was found to be expressed very strongly in the adrenal cortex of adults and strongly in the renal tubules of the kidney, capillary blood vessels of the brain, and also in placenta. Interestingly, P-GP was not distributed in fetal and neonatal adrenals, and thus may be closely related to adrenal maturation. A high level of P-GP expression was also seen in all cases of functional hormone-producing adrenal tumor, one case of insulinoma, two cases of untreated colonic cancer, one case each of untreated lung cancer, gastric cancer and breast cancer, six cases of renal cell carcinoma and 17 cases of bladder cancer. Using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the reactivity of MRK 16 MAb with peripheral human mononuclear cells (mainly blastic cells and lymphocytes) from 31 patients with leukemia or malignant lymphoma. Reactivity with MRK 16 MAb was observed in five cases. Some cases reflected the prior administration of adriamycin, vincristine and VP-16, which are known to induce P-GP expression. P-GP-MRK 16-protein A-Sepharose complex derived from human adrenal possessed marked ATPase activity. These data suggest that P-GP may play a physiological role in the human adrenal. Finally, diagnostic criteria of multi-drug-resistant cancers are presented.","['Sugawara, I']",['Sugawara I'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (mdr gene protein, Plasmodium)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', '*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Adrenal Cortex/*metabolism/physiology', 'Brain/*metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney/*metabolism/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Protozoan Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1990.tb01598.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1990 Aug;40(8):545-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1990.tb01598.x.,['mdr1'],,,,,,42,,,,,,,,,

To assess their potential oncogenic role, normal bone marrow cells were infected with retroviruses bearing the genes for IL-3 or IL-3 plus Hox-2.4. Unlike the IL-3 virus, the IL-3/Hox-2.4 virus was highly leukemogenic. Infected cells expressing both genes exhibited retarded differentiation in vitro, generated myelomonocytic cell lines, and provoked a rapid, transplantable myeloid leukemia in vivo. The oncogenic action of Hox-2.4 appears to derive from its ability to impede the IL-3-driven terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. The results suggest that homeobox genes can regulate key differentiation processes such as self-renewal capacity and that their inappropriate expression can be oncogenic.","['Perkins, A', 'Kongsuwan, K', 'Visvader, J', 'Adams, J M', 'Cory, S']","['Perkins A', 'Kongsuwan K', 'Visvader J', 'Adams JM', 'Cory S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.21.8398 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Nov;87(21):8398-402. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.21.8398.,['Hox-2.4'],PMC54963,['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both ELISAs gave positive and negative predictive values for IPA of greater than 95%, demonstrating the value of antigen detection in early diagnosis of aspergillus infection and the assay's ability to predict subsequent development of IPA.

For example, 2 B-cell precursor ALL had rearranged TCR beta chain genes and 2 T-ALL rearrangement of Ig heavy-chain genes. All cases showed clonal rearrangement or deletions within the TCR delta gene locus. TCR delta gene rearrangements might, therefore, serve as markers of clonality but not of B- or T-lineage in immature lymphoid neoplasms.

No P-170 could be detected in normal bone marrow or buffy coat. Overexpression of P-170 without amplification of MDR-1 was found in four of 11 patients with chronic phase CML at diagnosis, seven of 16 patients treated with busulfan or hydroxyurea in chronic phase and four of 15 patients in blast crisis. The P-170 overexpression involved only cells of the granulocyte lineage and varied from weak to strong in individual patients. It did not correlate with duration of or response to treatment during chronic phase. In transformation P-170 expression was seen in differentiated cells of the granulocyte lineage but not in blast cells, although three patients had been treated intensively with lipophilic and other cytotoxic drugs to which they had become resistant.

U-937 and fresh leukemic monoblasts under standard culture conditions do not adhere and do not form podosomes, but, when treated with TPA, they promptly adhere to substrate, form podosomes and focal adhesions in different cells and display the same integrin/cytoskeleton relationship as normal mature monocytes. Further, in these cells CD18, CD11a, CD11c, ICAM-1, and talin, but not vinculin, co-localize in homotypic cell junctions, thus showing a close relationship between integrins and talin.

To investigate the immunopathogenesis and viral genetic determinants responsible for the induction of immunodeficiency disease in vivo, we have generated chimeras between the two major viral genomes in the original virus isolate, designated common form clone 61E and major variant clone 61C, which were molecularly cloned directly from DNA of the same animal and tissue. Each of three 61E/C chimeras, containing at minimum a 34-amino-acid segment (including a 6-amino-acid insertion and one amino acid substitution) near the C terminus of the 61C surface glycoprotein (gp70), induced fatal immunodeficiency disease in all (12 of 12) infected animals over a course of 33 +/- 10 weeks. By contrast, animals infected with virus 61E, although persistently antigenemic, remained asymptomatic throughout a 48-week observation period. Beginning 14 weeks after infection, a significant decrease (8 to 10%) in the percent of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes developed in the 61E/C chimera-infected cats, compared with either 61E-infected or control animals. At this time, no significant changes were seen in CD8 cells, B cells, or mitogen-induced blastogenesis. Prior to this initial decline in CD4 cells, the ability of all antigenemic 61E/C-infected cats to generate a primary antibody response to the T-cell-dependent antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin was markedly impaired, whereas all 61E-infected cats, one 61E/C-infected but nonviremic cat, and all uninfected control cats produced normal antibody responses. The results reported here demonstrate that a major determinant of in vivo immunodeficiency induction by FeLV-FAIDS is contained within a 34-amino-acid C-terminal segment of its surface glycoprotein and that this gp70 alteration determines the early and persistent deficits in CD4+ T lymphocytes and T-cell-dependent antibody responses. We hypothesize that these early immunologic alterations could result from early deletion of a CD4+ helper T-cell subset.","['Quackenbush, S L', 'Donahue, P R', 'Dean, G A', 'Myles, M H', 'Ackley, C D', 'Cooper, M D', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Quackenbush SL', 'Donahue PR', 'Dean GA', 'Myles MH', 'Ackley CD', 'Cooper MD', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cats', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.11.5465-5474.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Nov;64(11):5465-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.11.5465-5474.1990.,,PMC248598,"['AI-25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the regulation of LT transcription by HTLV-I, we analyzed the ability of a series of deletions of the LT promoter to drive the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in HTLV-I-positive MT-2 cells. The smallest LT promoter fragment (-140 to +77) that was able to drive CAT activity contained a site that was similar to the immunoglobulin kappa-chain NF-kappa B-binding site. Since the HTLV-I tax gene activates the nuclear form of NF-kappa B, this finding suggested a possible means of HTLV-I activation of LT production. We found that the LT kappa B-like site specifically formed a complex with NF-kappa B-containing nuclear extract from MT-2, C81-66-45, and other activated T cells. Mutation of the LT kappa B site in the context of the LT promoter (-293 to +77) (mutant M1) reduced the ability of the promoter to drive the CAT gene in HTLV-I-infected and noninfected human T-cell lines. These data suggest a general role for NF-kappa B activation in the induction of LT gene transcription. Activation of LT in HTLV-I-infected cells may explain the pathology associated with HTLV-I infection, including the hypercalcemia that is prevalent in adult T-cell leukemia.","['Paul, N L', 'Lenardo, M J', 'Novak, K D', 'Sarr, T', 'Tang, W L', 'Ruddle, N H']","['Paul NL', 'Lenardo MJ', 'Novak KD', 'Sarr T', 'Tang WL', 'Ruddle NH']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*physiopathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.11.5412-5419.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Nov;64(11):5412-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.11.5412-5419.1990.,,PMC248592,"['R01-CA-16885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI-07019/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This procedure consists of a first amplification and a second amplification with the products of the first amplification and primers interior to the first primers. Using this method, we demonstrated that it is possible to detect single-template DNA. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the nested double PCR products, with our primers, revealed three bands with excess amounts of template DNA, two bands with moderate amounts, and a single band with limited amounts. The amount of provirus in PBMC was roughly estimated from the results of the nested double PCR. Particle agglutination (PA) assays and indirect immunofluorescence testing (IF) with mixed MT-2 cells and Molt-4 cells as targets to detect anti-HTLV-I antibody were performed, and the results were compared with those of the nested double PCR of the pX region. None of the 101 PA-negative samples were positive in either the IF or PCR test. Of the 155 samples that were antibody positive by the PA assay, 57 were positive by both PCR and IF. Furthermore, the results of the IF and PCR tests coincided completely. It was therefore concluded that the IF method is most appropriate for confirmation of the PA assay currently used in most diagnostic laboratories and blood centers.","['Matsumoto, C', 'Mitsunaga, S', 'Oguchi, T', 'Mitomi, Y', 'Shimada, T', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Watanabe, J', 'Nishioka, K']","['Matsumoto C', 'Mitsunaga S', 'Oguchi T', 'Mitomi Y', 'Shimada T', 'Ichikawa A', 'Watanabe J', 'Nishioka K']","['Japanese Red Cross Central Blood Center, Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*diagnosis', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.11.5290-5294.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Nov;64(11):5290-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.11.5290-5294.1990.,,PMC248573,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, in order to determine the distribution of antibody to ATL-associated antigen (anti-ATLA) in the Karatsu and Higashimatsuura districts of the northern Kyusyu, the determination of anti-ATLA status of patients in Karatsu Red Cross Hospital was carried out from September to October, 1985. Sera from 757 patients were tested for presence of anti-ATLA by Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) prepared by Eisai Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan. Results obtained are as follows: 1) Overall prevalence of anti-ATLA was 13.7 per cent (104 of 757 individuals). Prevalence of anti-ATLA increased with age, reaching a maximum of 21.1 per cent for people from 60 to 69 years old. 2) Prevalence of anti-ATLA was 9.5 per cent (36 of 376) in males and 17.8 per cent (68 of 381) in females. A significant difference by sex was recognized.

The positive rate of the seaside area was significantly higher than that of the mountain area. (p less than 0.001). 4) Anti-ATLA was most prevalent in the patients with neoplasms (26.1%). The positive rate of ATL patients was 100 per cent, and that of patients with malignancies other than ATL was 25.9 per cent.

Unlike resting CD4+ normal T lymphocytes that can be activated only by a two-signal stimulation, T-CLL cells proliferated and released IL-2 in response to a pair of anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) or concanavalin A (Con A) in the absence of both accessory cells (AC) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The two stimuli were also able to induce CD25 expression within 12-20 h on the majority of T-CLL cells. A response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 MoAbs was detected only in the presence of PMA, similar to that observed in normal resting T lymphocytes matched for phenotype. Both Con A- and CD2-induced proliferation were strongly inhibited by the addition of anti-CD25 MoAb. Furthermore, T-CLL lymphocytes acquired anti-tumour lytic activity after culture in the presence of PMA and ionomycin.

These results indicate that HTLV-I can be transmitted with as little as 0.01 mL of virus-infected blood, and that passive immunization is effective in preventing cell-to-cell infection of HTLV-I when given within 24 hours of transfusion of virus-infected blood.","['Kataoka, R', 'Takehara, N', 'Iwahara, Y', 'Sawada, T', 'Ohtsuki, Y', 'Dawei, Y', 'Hoshino, H', 'Miyoshi, I']","['Kataoka R', 'Takehara N', 'Iwahara Y', 'Sawada T', 'Ohtsuki Y', 'Dawei Y', 'Hoshino H', 'Miyoshi I']","['Department of Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/analysis', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/microbiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/isolation & purification', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Rabbits', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75240-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 15;76(8):1657-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three of these patients (nos. 1-3; T-ALL) a combination of CD3 and anti-TdT antibodies (Abs) was used to identify residual blasts while in patient 4 (B lineage ALL) the combination CD13/TdT served to detect residual disease. Two rounds of PCR primed by nested amplimers were carried out to prepare clonospecific probes from presentation DNA and to investigate the follow-up samples. In patients 1 and 2 no cCD3+/TdT+ cells were seen posttreatment, but PCR amplification of the TCR V delta 1-D-J delta 1 region revealed residual disease in both patients. Patient 1 underwent allogeneic BM transplant (BMT) 8 months after diagnosis and is well 3 months post-BMT while patient 2 relapsed 12 months after presentation. In patient 3 the remission samples investigated 2 and 3 months after diagnosis did not contain cCD3+/TdT+ cells, but in the sample collected at 4 months a few such cells (0.0001-0.001%) could be detected. In the same sample, PCR amplification of the TCR V delta 2-D-J delta 1 region indicated the presence of 10(-4)-10(-3) residual leukemic cells. These findings predicted full morphological relapse which occurred 2 months later. In patient 4 CD13/TdT double positive cells were clearly seen 2 and 3 months after presentation. PCR amplification of the V delta 2-D delta 3 recombination also revealed residual blasts when applied to one of such ""remission"" samples. After further remission induction treatment, no immunologic evidence of residual disease was detected. This patient received an allogeneic BMT 8 months after diagnosis and is disease free 4 months after BMT. Our data indicate that both double color immunofluorescence and PCR analysis offer powerful tools to study residual leukemia and highlight the advantages as well as the potential limitations of each technique.","['Campana, D', 'Yokota, S', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Hansen-Hagge, T E', 'Janossy, G', 'Bartram, C R']","['Campana D', 'Yokota S', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Hansen-Hagge TE', 'Janossy G', 'Bartram CR']","['Department of Immunology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'CD13 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Remission Induction']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Sep;4(9):609-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PGA2 and J2, which have an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring, elevated the GSH content, but PGB2, D2, E2 and F2 alpha did not show the effect. When L-1210 cells were incubated with various 2-cyclopentenone derivatives, 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone and some of related compounds elevated cellular GSH levels. Subsequent study with cell-free extract of cultured L-1210 cells revealed that PGA2 and 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone induced gamma-glutamycysteine synthetase activity at the transcriptional level. This induction was also found in other cultured mammalian cells such as HeLa S3, NIH/3T3 and porcine aorta endothelial cells. When L-1210 cells were incubated with PGA2 in the presence of 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone and its analogues, they inhibited the accumulation of PGA2 in cell nuclei. Our findings thus suggest that an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl moiety is responsible for enhancing the biosynthesis of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase in cultured cells.","['Ohno, K', 'Higaki, J', 'Takechi, S', 'Hirata, M']","['Ohno K', 'Higaki J', 'Takechi S', 'Hirata M']","['Shiongi Research Laboratories, Shionogi and Co.

The density of children was higher in the rural, but lower in the overspill, New Towns than in the areas from which their incomers originated. Residents of the rural New Towns had greater diversity of origin than those of the overspill towns of London and Glasgow. These two factors would encourage a greater rise in the postulated underlying infection in the rural towns, and in these a significant excess of leukaemia at ages 0-4 was found in 1946-65. In both sets of towns there was a significant deficit in other age groups consistent with immunising effects of the relevant infection. There are parallels with feline leukaemia virus infection, in which contrasting leukaemogenic and immunising effects occur in different social settings owing mainly to differences in intensity of viral exposure.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Clarke, K', 'Hudson, C']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Clarke K', 'Hudson C']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Lancet. 1991 Feb 9;337(8737):361.

However, these cell lines could act as NK-sensitive target cells if they were pulsed with heat-inactivated, whole simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The ability of these SIV-pulsed T-cell lines to act as NK-sensitive target cells was directly related to the relative density of CD4 on their surface. Target cell generation was inhibited by preincubation of cell lines with CD4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) with specificity for the SIV binding site. In addition, NK activity was seen against target cells that had been prepared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120, nonglycosylated gp120, env A of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and simian type D retrovirus (SRV). Addition of leupeptin to target cells prior to SIV pulsing did not result in a significant decrease in cytotoxic activity, suggesting that processing is not required for the generation of target cells. The cells that mediate NK activity are nonadherent, do not form rosettes with AET-treated sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and are phenotypically CD16+ and CD8+. NK activity of SIV-infected macaques was significantly decreased against both K562 cells and SIV-pulsed target cells as compared with uninfected animals. However, treatment of PBMC with interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in a partial restoration of NK activity.","['Vowels, B R', 'Gershwin, M E', 'Gardner, M B', 'McGraw, T P']","['Vowels BR', 'Gershwin ME', 'Gardner MB', 'McGraw TP']","['Department of Medical Pathology, California Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Leupeptins)', 'J97339NR3V (leupeptin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*immunology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1990.6.905 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1990 Jul;6(7):905-18. doi: 10.1089/aid.1990.6.905.,,,"['AI 26471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 00169/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether lymphocyte adhesion molecules involved in the migration of normal lymphocytes, i.e., CD44 homing receptor, LFA-1 (CD11a/18), and ICAM-1 (CD54), also play a role in the spread and hence in the disease course of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), expression of these molecules was examined in 78 cases of diffuse large-cell lymphoma. Other potential risk factors considered in this study were sex, age, primary tumor localization, lineage (T cell vs. B cell), and histopathological subtype. 27 of 53 (51%) patients with a lymphoma having a high CD44 antigen expression showed tumor spread beyond stage II at diagnosis while this was the case in only three of 25 (12%) patients with lymphomas that were CD44 low/negative (chi-square 25.4, p less than 0.001). Similarly, poor response to treatment, i.e., absence of remission or relapse, and or death from lymphoma, was more common among patients with lymphomas expressing high levels of CD44; actuarial survival among patients with CD44 high and low lymphomas was 47% and 91%, respectively (Mantel-Cox 6.1, p = 0.02). Neither LFA-1 nor ICAM-1 expression showed a significant correlation to lymphoma dissemination or disease course. Of the other factors considered, T cell phenotype was associated with an unfavorable prognosis while nodal localization was a risk factor for dissemination. Taken together, our findings suggest that CD44 antigen expression plays an important role in the dissemination of NHL and via this mechanism exerts an unfavorable prognostic influence.","['Horst, E', 'Meijer, C J', 'Radaszkiewicz, T', 'Ossekoppele, G J', 'Van Krieken, J H', 'Pals, S T']","['Horst E', 'Meijer CJ', 'Radaszkiewicz T', 'Ossekoppele GJ', 'Van Krieken JH', 'Pals ST']","['Department of Pathology, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Aug;4(8):595-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of the human ADA gene was under control of a hybrid long terminal repeat in which the enhancer from the Moloney murine leukemia virus was replaced by an enhancer from the F101 host-range mutant of polyoma virus. Hemopoietic stem cells in murine bone marrow were infected with this virus under defined culture conditions. As a result, 59% of day-12 colony forming unit spleen (CFU-S) stem cells became infected without any in vitro selection. Infected CFU-S were shown to express human ADA before transplantation and this expression sustained upon in vivo maturation. Mice transplanted with infected bone marrow exhibited human ADA expression in lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid cell types. Moreover, human ADA expression persisted in secondary and tertiary transplanted recipients showing that human ADA-expressing cells were derived from pluripotent stem cells. These characteristics of our amphotropic viruses make them promising tools in gene therapy protocols for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency caused by ADA deficiency.

In the present study, we have analyzed the ability of lymph node cells from infected mice to generate secondary in vitro proliferative responses to soluble antigens. Our data demonstrate that the ability of lymph node cells to proliferate in response to soluble antigen or T cell mitogens declines progressively during the course of MAIDS. Impaired proliferative responses were shown to be characteristic of purified CD4+ but not CD8+ cells from infected mice when stimulated in the presence of normal accessory cells. In addition, the impaired responses of unseparated lymph node cells from infected mice could be reconstituted by the addition of purified CD4+ T cells from nodes of primed normal animals. These results strongly suggest that an intrinsic CD4+ T cell defect developing during the course of MAIDS contributes significantly to impaired responses to mitogens and to impaired secondary in vitro proliferative responses to soluble antigen.","['Cerny, A', 'Hugin, A W', 'Holmes, K L', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Cerny A', 'Hugin AW', 'Holmes KL', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Mitogens)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'FV4Y0JO2CX (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin)']",IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Separation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemocyanins/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogens']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830200725 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1990 Jul;20(7):1577-81. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830200725.,,,['N01.AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined BP-1/6C3 expression in a panel of established Abelson virus-transformed cells that includes both cells analogous to pre-B cells and to less differentiated B lineage cells that have not yet completed Ig H chain gene rearrangement. This analysis reveals that many of the less differentiated transformants do not express BP-1/6C3 for an extended culture period. In contrast, virtually all transformants that are analogous to normal pre-B cells express the determinant early in their culture history. The BP-1/6C3 negative transformants are fully tumorigenic in syngeneic mice, demonstrating that BP-1/6C3 expression is not required for complete malignant transformation. Our data thus suggest that the pattern of BP-1/6C3 expression in Abelson virus-transformed cells mimics that observed in normal cells and is indicative of a differentiation event unrelated to the malignant potential of the cells.","['Ramakrishnan, L', 'Wu, Q', 'Yue, A', 'Cooper, M D', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Ramakrishnan L', 'Wu Q', 'Yue A', 'Cooper MD', 'Rosenberg N']","['Immunology Graduate Program, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Aminopeptidases/*immunology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Oncogenes']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Sep 1;145(5):1603-8.,,,"['CA 16693/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This marker was expressed by malignant cells of 57 out of 118 patients with myeloid malignancies and 69 out of 135 with B-lymphoid malignancies. On the other hand, CD54 was not detected on malignant cells of 16 patients with T-lymphoid malignancies. In myeloid malignancies, CD54 is preferentially expressed by ""stem cell-derived"" malignancies, being detectable on blast cells from almost all patients affected by chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase or myelodysplastic syndromes and by only 34% of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The expression of CD54 did not correlate with any specific myeloid FAB subtype, although three cases of highly undifferentiated AML (FAB MO) displayed maximal levels of the antigen. The expression of CD54 in AML was significantly associated with that of CD34 and HLA-DR antigens. In B-lymphoid malignancies, CD54 expression appears to correlate with the differentiation stage of malignant cells, since B-origin acute lymphoblastic leukemias and conventional B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL; ie, ""dim SIg"" CLL) expressed lower levels of CD54 than more mature lymphoproliferative disorders (""bright SIg"" CLL, prolymphocytic leukemias, and lymphoplasmacytic tumors).

Two of these (es and ei) are equilibrative (facilitated diffusion) carriers that have been studied is considerable detail. The other two (cif and cit) are concentrative, Na(+)-dependent carriers. A major obstacle to the characterization of the latter two mechanisms has been the lack of suitable model systems expressing only a single nucleoside transport activity. The present study describes the isolation of a cell line that has cif as its sole nucleoside transporter. L1210/MC5-1 cells, which have es and cif transport activity, were mutagenized and plated in soft agar containing two cytotoxic nucleosides (tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) and cytosine arabinoside) that are substrates for es but not cif. A clonal line (L1210/MA-27.1) was isolated which retained the capacity for Na(+)-dependent [3H]formycin B transport but was unable to transport [3H]thymidine, a substrate for es but not cif. Failure of the mutant to transport thymidine was also demonstrated by the inability of thymidine (with adenine as a purine source) to rescue these cells from methotrexate toxicity. Furthermore, the mutant lacked nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) binding activity (an integral part of the es transporter) as demonstrated by reversible NBMPR binding and photoaffinity labeling with [3H]NBMPR. Loss of es transport activity was also demonstrated by the failure of NBMPR to affect the toxicity of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (IC50 approximately 30 nM) in L1210/MA27.1 cells. In contrast, NBMPR decreased the IC50 for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine from 100 to 30 nM in the parental L1210/MC5-1 cell line. These results are consistent with the mechanism of NBMPR potentiation of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine toxicity in L1210 cells being a blockade of efflux via es while the nucleoside is pumped into the cells by the concentrative cif carrier.","['Crawford, C R', 'Ng, C Y', 'Belt, J A']","['Crawford CR', 'Ng CY', 'Belt JA']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Affinity Labels/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Sodium/*pharmacology', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)77410-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Aug 15;265(23):13730-4.,,,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA33362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 95 children on 6-MP showed wide interindividual differences in RBC 6-TGN concentrations at the full protocol dose of 75 mg/m2, and RBC 6-TGN concentrations correlated negatively with RBC TPMT activity. Children with 6-TGN concentrations below the group median had higher TPMT activities and a higher subsequent relapse rate. 50 of the 104 long-term survivors had been treated with ""gentle"" low-dose protocols, and this subgroup contained an excess of children with lower TPMT activities compared with normal controls. These results indicate that genetically determined TPMT activity may be a substantial regulator of the cytotoxic effect of 6-MP, an effect which in turn could be important in influencing the outcome of therapy for childhood ALL.","['Lennard, L', 'Lilleyman, J S', 'Van Loon, J', 'Weinshilboum, R M']","['Lennard L', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Van Loon J', 'Weinshilboum RM']","['University of Sheffield, Department of Medicine and Pharmacology, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*blood/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Thionucleotides/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1990/07/28 00:00,1990/07/28 00:01,['1990/07/28 00:00'],"['1990/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(90)91745-V [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(90)91745-v [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1990 Jul 28;336(8709):225-9. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(90)91745-v.,,,"['ES 55110/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 35720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients (3.0%) developed abdominal complications during their course of disease, including acute appendicitis, intussusception, intestinal perforation, ovarian cyst rupture, etc. All of these patients had abdominal complications during the initial presentation or relapse of leukemia, and 9 (82%) of them had just received chemotherapy. Ten patients (91%) had thrombocytopenia and 7 (64%) had leukopenia. Blood cultures were positive in 5 patients (45%), and gram-negative enteric bacilli were isolated in 4 of them. All 5 septicemic patients had leukopenia or neutropenia. The clinical manifestations were nonspecific and were often masked. Most of the complications occurred in the right lower abdominal structures. Of the 7 children treated surgically, 3 had long term survival. Among the 4 patients who did not receive an operation, only 1 survived for more than 4 weeks. The mean length of survival tended to be longer in patients with additional surgical treatment.

These combinations include cCD3/TdT, a thymic feature retained on thymic-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) blasts outside the thymus, and the coexpression of TdT and myeloid markers (CD13, CD33) on a proportion of ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, double marker immunofluorescence assays are operationally leukemia-specific and can be applied in 35% of acute leukemias for detecting minimal disease at a less than 10(-4) level; only rare cases, 2 of 35 in our study, switch these relevant features during relapse. The sensitivity and specificity of these assays was tested as follows. First, bone marrow samples taken from patients who had originally presented with blasts expressing the leukemia-associated combinations but were in full morphologic remission were studied, and varying numbers (less than 0.01% to 10% of the mononuclear fraction) of cells with aberrant features were identified in 11.6% of the cases. Second, the outcome of 19 patients with minimal disease identified immunologically while in complete morphologic remission was investigated: all 19 patients have developed systemic relapse within 4 to 25 (median 14.5) weeks. In contrast, 17 of 25 patients also morphologically in complete remission and without residual disease identifiable immunologically after repeated testing are still in morphologic and immunologic remission (follow-up 17 to 114 weeks, median 28 weeks). Only eight patients in this group have relapsed so far: in two patients the relapse was localized in the cerebrospinal fluid, while in six patients a systemic relapse was observed 6 to 51 (median 21.5) weeks after the last negative immunologic bone marrow examination. In conclusion, no false-positive results were detected with these sensitive assays, and the introduction of appropriately planned prospective studies, including the immunologic detection of residual leukemia, is justified on the basis of these observations.","['Campana, D', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Janossy, G']","['Campana D', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Janossy G']","['Department of Immunology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'CD13 Antigens', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84274-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jul 1;76(1):163-71.,,,,,['Blood 1990 Nov 1;76(7):1901'],,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect evidence suggests that there must be several pseudoautosomal genes, and several candidates have been proposed. Until now, the only gene that has been unequivocally located in the PAR is MIC2, which encodes a cell-surface antigen of unknown function. We now report the localization of a gene of known function to this region--the gene for the receptor of the haemopoietic regulator, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor.

Expression of mdr1 was found in samples from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (13 of 17), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML, chronic phase, 10 of 10; blast crisis, three of four), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, eight of 11), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL, 17 of 17), hairy cell leukemia (HCL, one of two), and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (one of one), but not in B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL, 0 of seven).

In vitro drug uptake studies by on-line flow cytometry showed that in leukemia cells expressing either mdr1 or mdr3, the steady-state accumulation of daunorubicin could be significantly increased by addition of cyclosporine and, to a lesser extent, by verapamil. Because cyclosporine and verapamil are known as inhibitors of the mdr1-encoded P-glycoprotein drug-efflux pump, and because the mdr1 and mdr3 genes are highly homologous, our data suggest that the mdr3 gene encodes a functional drug pump in B-cell lymphocytic leukemias. The results of this study may have implications for clinical therapy for acute or chronic leukemias expressing the mdr1 or mdr3 gene, in particular, treatment with combinations of cytotoxic drugs plus agents that reverse multidrug resistance. Since mdr1 and mdr3 are frequently expressed in untreated as well as treated leukemia, such combination therapy should be considered for untreated patients as well as treated patients.","['Herweijer, H', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Baas, F', 'Nooter, K']","['Herweijer H', 'Sonneveld P', 'Baas F', 'Nooter K']","['Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/04 00:00,1990/07/04 00:01,['1990/07/04 00:00'],"['1990/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/82.13.1133 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Jul 4;82(13):1133-40. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.13.1133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best medium of those tested was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 micrograms/ml each transferrin and insulin + 5 ng/ml sodium selenite +/- 0.1% bovine serum albumin. While growing either with or without albumin, the several clonal lines of CEM cells displayed growth similar to serum-supplemented cultures. Cell proliferation of CEM-C7 cells cultured in both serum-free media has been sustained for 3 mo. with culture doubling times of about 25 h for both serum-supplemented and serum-free cultures (viability greater than or equal to 90%). Cell morphology remained essentially the same in serum-free or serum containing media. The expression of CD4, a marker for T-derived lymphoid cells, was not significantly different in serum-free medium. When grown in serum-free medium, CEM-C7 cells exhibited increased steroid responsiveness as evidenced by increased glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, increased induction of glutamine synthetase, and cell lysis at lower concentrations of steroid. Receptor mutant subclones of CEM-C7, which are proven to be completely unresponsive to micromolar concentrations of dexamethasone when grown in serum-supplemented medium, become partially sensitive to the hormone after growth in defined medium. The increased sensitivity of CEM-C7 cells and its subclones to dexamethasone in serum-free medium returned to previous levels when these cells were recultured in serum-containing medium. Our results suggest that substances in serum influence steroid effects on these cells and that the molecular details of glucocorticoid hormone action may be pursued more precisely in a clearly defined culture medium.","['Chilton, D G', 'Johnson, B H', 'Danel-Moore, L', 'Kawa, S', 'Thompson, E B']","['Chilton DG', 'Johnson BH', 'Danel-Moore L', 'Kawa S', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol,In vitro cellular & developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture Association,8506951,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Transferrin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,,"['CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Selenium/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Transferrin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02624204 [doi]'],ppublish,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol. 1990 Jun;26(6):561-70. doi: 10.1007/BF02624204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the generation of human LAK cells with low-dose IL2 (1-10 U) in combination with human tumor cell lines. A significant LAK activity was generated within 3- to 5-days culture of PBL. Among six human tumor cell lines tested, the K562 cell line had the greatest stimulating activity, and the degree of cytotoxicity was comparative to that of PBL stimulated with higher doses of IL2 alone. The origin of this LAK activity was primarily the E(-) rosetting cell population. Cocultures of E- cells with 1 U/ml IL2 plus K562 had significantly higher cytotoxicity (P less than 0.05) compared to using E+ cells. Phenotypic analysis indicated that 1 U/ml IL2 plus K562 cell stimulation enhanced CD56+ and CD16+ cells. These studies suggest that very low dosages of IL2 with stimulator tumor cells can generate LAK activity comparable to that generated with high dosages of IL2 alone.","['Yamamoto, S', 'Hoon, D S', 'Chandler, P', 'Schmid, I', 'Irie, R F']","['Yamamoto S', 'Hoon DS', 'Chandler P', 'Schmid I', 'Irie RF']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(90)90045-S [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90045-s [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1990 Jul;128(2):516-27. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(90)90045-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomic organization of two newly described induced lymphokine genes, 464.1 and 744.1, has been determined. 464.1 and 744.1 appear to be the human homologues of the recently cloned murine macrophage inflammatory proteins, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, respectively. The 464.1 and 744.1 genes share 55% amino acid homology and demonstrate parallel regulation of induced expression in T cells. It was therefore of interest to observe that these genes are closely linked in the human genome, separated by 14 kb, and are organized in a head to head fashion. Each of the genes is present in an additional nonallelic copy (referred to as 464.2 and 744.2) as part of an apparent amplification unit in the genome of many individuals. The 464.2 gene is expressed and potentially encodes a protein highly related to 464.1, varying in 5 of 92 amino acids. As expected, 464.2 and 744.2 are also closely linked to each other as determined by population linkage disequilibrium studies. Individuals bearing a chromosome with a third amplification event, involving a 464-related gene but not a 744-related gene, are also infrequently observed.

Commitment, the irreversible initiation of the program of terminal-cell differentiation, is first detected in HMBA-sensitive DS19-SC9 MELC in culture after 10 to 12 h of exposure to HMBA. Vincristine (VC)-resistant MELC derived from the DS19-SC9 MELC line display increased sensitivity to HMBA and become committed with little or no latent period. In the present study, we showed that the MELC line R1, which is resistant to HMBA-mediated differentiation, became sensitive to inducer if selected for a low level of VC resistance (less than 10 ng of VC per ml). Four independently derived VC-resistant cell lines from HMBA-resistant R1 cells, designated R1[VCR]a to R1[VCR]d, acquired sensitivity to HMBA and the accelerated kinetics of commitment that are characteristic of VC-resistant MELC derived from the parental DS19-SC9 cells. The calcium channel blocker verapamil suppresses the VC resistance of R1[VCR] cells but does not alter the accelerated response to HMBA. In R1[VCR] cells there was no detectable increase in the level of the 140-kilodalton P-glycoprotein. Transient inhibition of protein synthesis during the latent period delays inducer-mediated commitment of VC-sensitive DS19-SC9 MELC but does not alter the accelerated commitment kinetics of R1[VCR]a cells. Previously, we have reported evidence that protein kinase C beta (PKC beta) plays a role in HMBA-induced MELC differentiation and that compared with DS19-SC9 cells, R1 cells have a relatively low level and R1[VCR]a cells have a high level of PKC beta. These findings suggest that (i) acquisition of VC resistance overcomes the block acquired by R1 cells to HMBA-mediated differentiation; (ii) the accelerated kinetics of HMBA-induced commitment of VC-resistant MELC is not dependent on the verapamil-sensitive transport channel that is responsible, at least in part, for resistance to VC; (iii) in VC-resistant MELC, there is constitutive expression or accumulation of a protein required for HMBA-induced differentiation; and (iv) an elevated level of PKC beta activity may play a role in the altered response of R1[VCR] and other VC-resistant MELC to HMBA.","['Michaeli, J', 'Lebedev, Y B', 'Richon, V M', 'Chen, Z X', 'Marks, P A', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Michaeli J', 'Lebedev YB', 'Richon VM', 'Chen ZX', 'Marks PA', 'Rifkind RA']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.10.7.3535-3540.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Jul;10(7):3535-40. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.7.3535-3540.1990.,,PMC360788,['CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different clinical and biological parameters able to influence the mobilization and the collection of circulating stem cells (CSC) have been reviewed: age seems not to have any significant influence on the peak of peripheral blood granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (PB CFU-GM), as opposed to the type of leukaemia, the presence of a chromosome translocation t(4;11) or t(9;22) in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and the intensity of the myeloablative chemotherapy. ABSCT was performed in 52 evaluable patients with acute leukaemia. In acute non lymphoblastic leukaemia, the disease free survival seems not to be inferior to that one of autologous bone marrow transplantation, but with a too short follow-up to be conclusive. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the rate of relapses after ABSCT is very high (about 75%), but all the patients presented initially with high risk leukaemia. In myeloma, ABSCT seems to be a very interesting new therapeutic approach, while may be limited by individual difficulties to obtain a number of CSC sufficient to insure a satisfactory engraftment.","['Henon, P R']",['Henon PR'],"['Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transfusion, Hopital du Hasenrain, Mulhouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Blood Transfusion, Autologous/*methods', 'Female', 'France', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1990 Jan-Feb;75 Suppl 1:53-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efflux of [3H]vincristine was more rapid in CEM/MTX R3 than in either CCRF-CEM cells or a methotrexate-resistant subline not refractory to Vinca alkaloids. In addition, verapamil completely reversed resistance to vincristine, vinblastine and actinomycin D in the CEM/MTX R3 cells. While these results are suggestive of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance, Northern analysis revealed no detectable expression of the mdr 1/gene in CEM/MTX R3 cells. Likewise, karyotypic analysis of the resistant subline, while revealing certain clonal abnormalities, provided no evidence of alteration in the mdr 1/gene locus on chromosome 7.

Five adult patients (four AML, one ALL) entered the study, each patient underwent two series of three leukapheresis, the first following induction chemotherapy and the second following the first course of consolidation. The first leukapheresis of each series was done when the white blood cell count reached 10(9)/l with subsequent leukapheresis every other day. Folinic acid (Lederle Laboratories, France) was administered at a dose of 50 mg (i.v.) per day, 15 days from initiation of chemotherapy and continuing through the third leukapheresis of the series (days 25-30). PBSC were collected on a Haemonetics V50 cell separator. In these five cases we observed an increased yield of both colony-forming units, granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) expressed per ml of cytapheresis product: CFU-GM x 18, BFU-E x 3 and if expressed per 10(4)/kg of body weight: CFU-GM x 30, BFU-E x 3 (CFU-GM P less than 0.05, BFU-E less than 0.01). Long-term blood culture (LTSC) from FA stimulated leukapheresis, in an attempt to quantitate the most primitive stem cells, demonstrated that this expansion of the PBSC was sustained in time. We found by means of LTSC that FA did not stimulate CFU-L from patients with AML (two cases tested). Finally two AML patients were grafted with FA-PBSC after Cytotoxan and total body irradiation (TBI). Haematopoietic reconstitution was rapid complete and sustained in time in both patients.

In order to identify primary sequences within the CD4 molecule that may be involved in the binding of the HIV-I envelope, we synthesized various peptides corresponding to the V1, V2, V3, and V4 domains of CD4. We tested the ability of these peptides to block the binding of purified HIV-I gp120 to CD4+ human lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. One of these peptides, corresponding to CD4 amino acids (74-95), when preincubated with gp120, blocked its subsequent binding to CEM cells by 80%. A truncated form of this peptide (81-95), was found to be as efficient as the longer peptide (74-95) in inhibiting the binding of gp120 to CEM cells. The same peptide did not block the binding of OKT4A or Leu3A anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, which were previously shown to block HIV-I binding to CD4. The peptides were also tested for their ability to block HIV-I infection of a T cell line in vitro. Only CD4 peptide (74-95) and the shorter fragment (81-95) succeeded in protecting T cells against infection with different HIV-I strains. All the other peptides examined had no effect on gp120 binding to CEM cells and did not block syncytia formation. Goat polyclonal antibodies against the CD4 peptide (74-95) gave modest interference of gp120 binding to CEM cells. These data suggest that the CD4 region (74-95) participates in the CD4-mediated binding and/or internalization of HIV-I virion.","['Shapira-Nahor, O', 'Golding, H', 'Vujcic, L K', 'Resto-Ruiz, S', 'Fields, R L', 'Robey, F A']","['Shapira-Nahor O', 'Golding H', 'Vujcic LK', 'Resto-Ruiz S', 'Fields RL', 'Robey FA']","['Peptide and Immunochemistry Unit, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CD4 Antigens/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*metabolism', 'HIV Infections/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(90)90010-O [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90010-o [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1990 Jun;128(1):101-17. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(90)90010-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the characterization of these cell types was extended by the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to hemopoietic differentiation antigens. Basophils and mast cells were enriched by mAbs and complement from chronic myeloid leukemia blood (n = 5) and dispersed lung tissue (n = 4), respectively. A panel of 80 mAbs was tested for being reactive with purified cell populations using flow cytometry and/or a combined toluidine blue-immunofluorescence staining procedure.

In contrast, mast cells lack CD22, CD26, CD31, CD40 and CDw65 antigen.

The synthesis of vimentin, which was examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, increased after 12-24 h of incubation of M1 cells in CM and the elevated level of synthesis continued up to 96 h. A macrophage cell line (Mm1) that was derived from spontaneously differentiated M1 cells constantly synthesized much higher levels of vimentin. The amount of vimentin, which was revealed by immunoblot analysis using an mAb against human vimentin, also increased after differentiation by a factor of 7 when compared on the basis of constant protein and by a factor of 17 on the basis of constant cell numbers. Mm1 cells contained greater than 12- and 45-fold more vimentin compared with undifferentiated M1 cells on the bases of constant protein and constant cell numbers, respectively. Northern blot analysis using vimentin cDNA as a probe revealed increases in vimentin mRNA in the differentiated M1 cells and Mm1 cells. Nuclear run-on assay showed that the expression of vimentin gene during the differentiation of M1 cells was transcriptionally regulated. Observations in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and EM clearly showed that vimentin bundles were rarely observed in undifferentiated M1 cells, and increased amounts of and large-size vimentin bundles were easily observed in differentiated M1 and Mm1 cells. These results suggest the participation of increased amounts of vimentin filaments in the maldistribution of nuclei in M1 cells during differentiation.","['Tsuru, A', 'Nakamura, N', 'Takayama, E', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Hirayoshi, K', 'Nagata, K']","['Tsuru A', 'Nakamura N', 'Takayama E', 'Suzuki Y', 'Hirayoshi K', 'Nagata K']","['Department of Cell Biology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '0 (Vimentin)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.110.5.1655 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1990 May;110(5):1655-64. doi: 10.1083/jcb.110.5.1655.,,PMC2200173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells were cultured in the presence of PGA2, a persistent rise of cellular GSH concentration was observed 6 h after the addition of PGA2. This stimulatory effect of PGA2 was abolished if the cells were pretreated with an enzyme inhibitor of GSH synthesis, buthionine sulfoximine. Subsequent study with cell free extract of cultured L-1210 has revealed that PGA2 stimulated the biosynthesis of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.2). Actinomycin D inhibited this stimulatory effect of PGA2 on cultured cells. The optimal pH, Km value for glutamic acid and sensitivity to inhibitors of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase from PGA2 treated and nontreated cells were virtually the same. Thus, our findings suggest that PGA2 induced gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase in cultured L-1210 cells which is responsible for the elevated level of GSH in these cells.","['Ohno, K', 'Hirata, M']","['Ohno K', 'Hirata M']","['Shionogi Research Laboratories, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'EC 6.3.2.3 (Glutathione Synthase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K6VT5BDY9E (prostaglandin A2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/*biosynthesis', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Synthase/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Synthases/*biosynthesis', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/30 00:00,1990/04/30 00:01,['1990/04/30 00:00'],"['1990/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(90)92356-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(90)92356-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1990 Apr 30;168(2):551-7. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(90)92356-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 3,231 subjects greater than or equal to 15 years of age, 135 (4.2%) had antibody detected in ELISA screening tests, but because only 20% were confirmed positive, HTLV seroprevalence varied from 0.2-2% throughout the Republic. Infection with HTLV clustered in Guaymi Indians living in Bocas del Toro province (9.9% prevalence rate). With the exception of Guaymi Indians, no major geographic, urban/rural, male/female or racial differences in antibody prevalence were observed; specifically, HTLV infection rates were not elevated in black Panamanians.

The investigation revealed that leukemic cells corresponding to common or mature thymocytes were never induced to express any myeloid antigens, and showed rearrangements of T cell antigen receptor (TcR) beta and gamma chain genes. Concomitant examination on leukemic cells from mature T cell malignancies, including adult T cell leukemia (ATL), T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL) and T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-NHL), also failed to express myeloid antigens in culture. By contrast, one of the panmyeloid antigens, CD13 (MCS-2) antigen was induced on leukemic cells corresponding to early thymocytes in 5 out of 7 cases in TPA-added culture and in 3 cases even in TPA-free culture. All of these CD13 antigen inducible cases exhibited the germ line configurations of TcR beta and gamma chain genes except for one case of T-ALL with sole TcR gamma chain gene rearrangement. These findings suggest that primitive T cells, still not undergoing TcR gene rearrangements, retain the characteristics of multipotent progenitor cells to possess different lineage markers and are able to express myeloid antigen not exceptionally. Both phenotypically and genotypically immature thymocytes are considered to be less restricted in the differentiation pathway of hematopoietic cells committed to T cell lineage.","['Arita, Y', 'Kita, K', 'Nasu, K', 'Doi, S', 'Fukuhara, S', 'Nishikori, M', 'Miwa, H', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Nosaka, T', 'Hatanaka, M']","['Arita Y', 'Kita K', 'Nasu K', 'Doi S', 'Fukuhara S', 'Nishikori M', 'Miwa H', 'Tatsumi E', 'Nosaka T', 'Hatanaka M', 'et al.']","['First Division of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai zasshi : journal of Japan Haematological Society,2984803R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi. 1990 Feb;53(1):21-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific RA receptors that are members of the steroid-thyroid hormone superfamily of nuclear transcription factors have recently been identified. We developed an HL-60 subclone that was relatively resistant to RA-induced differentiation. Specific nuclear RA receptors in this RA-resistant subclone had a decreased affinity for RA and exhibited a lower molecular weight compared with nuclear RA receptors from the RA-sensitive parental HL-60 cells. Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of a single copy of the RA receptor (RAR-alpha) into this RA-resistant HL-60 subclone restored the sensitivity of these cells to RA.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the virus etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia, and human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) has been rarely associated with some forms of leukemia related to hairy-cell leukemia. Understanding the pathogenesis of these retroviruses requires elucidating the mechanism by which HTLV immortalizes cells. Two hypothetical modes of HTLV-induced transformation are discussed in this review. At the cell surface, HTLV particles via as yet unknown receptors have mitogenic effects on T-cell growth. Once HTLV productively infects the cell, it can initiate molecular changes as well. The HTLV genome encodes a viral regulatory protein, Tax, which not only activates HTLV gene expression, but may also induce inappropriate expression of cellular genes involved in cell proliferation. Models are proposed for how these events mediated by HTLV may contribute to T-cell transformation and ultimately, leukemia.","['Yip, M T', 'Chen, I S']","['Yip MT', 'Chen IS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mol Biol Med,Molecular biology & medicine,8403879,,IM,,"['Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol Med. 1990 Feb;7(1):33-44.,,,,,,,101,,,,,,,,,

The present paper aims to review briefly some of the experimental data with respect to the molecular mechanisms underlying these radiation-induced carcinogenic processes. Thymic lymphomagenesis proceeds through an indirect mechanism. Recombinant proviruses often occur in the tumour cell DNA, favouring the idea that they might be involved. However, there are indications that they might mediate tumour growth rather than induction. It is plausible that activation of ras oncogenes by somatic point mutations might play a role in the carcinogenic process, although at a yet undetermined stage. Myeloid leukaemogenesis is characterized by a very early, putative initiating event, consisting of non-random rearrangements and/or deletions of chromosome 2. These may be related to deletions in the developmentally important homeobox gene clusters and to rearrangements of the sequences flanking the IL-1 beta gene. Either a gene of the homeobox family or IL-1 beta might be considered as potentially involved in the induction process. Osteosarcomagenesis in mice is often associated with the expression of proviruses, and the tumours often contain somatically acquired proviruses. These viruses may contribute to tumour development by affecting various growth-suppressor genes. Viruses isolated from bone tumours, although non-sarcomagenic, induce osteopetrosis, osteomas and lymphomas upon infection of newborn mice. Osteogenic tumours frequently display amplification of a region on mouse chromosome 15, which encompasses c-myc and Mlvi-1 sequences. Enhanced transcription of various oncogenes is found in individual tumours, but no specificity for osteosarcomas has been identified. In vitro systems of skeletoblast differentiation are being developed to study tumour induction in vitro.","['Janowski, M', 'Cox, R', 'Strauss, P G']","['Janowski M', 'Cox R', 'Strauss PG']","['SCK/CEN, Department of Radioprotection, Mol, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Osteosarcoma/*etiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['N597456ED6YN2T7M [pii]', '10.1080/09553009014550851 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1990 Apr;57(4):677-91. doi: 10.1080/09553009014550851.,,,,,,,107,,,,,,,,,

Neoplastic transformation by AEV is mediated principally by an oncogene known as v-erb-B. We have explored the means by which this gene is expressed from the genome of AEV and uncovered an important structural determinant for the potency of the oncogene. In order to define the boundaries of v-erb-B and the supplementary oncogene, v-erb-A, we sequenced all but a small portion of the genome of the ES4 strain of AEV. We then demonstrated that, during expression in infected cells, splicing fuses the first six amino acids of the retroviral gene gag to the body of the v-erb-B protein. In order to explore the impact of this fusion on the function of v-erb-B, we constructed vectors with Murine Leukemia Virus that express the oncogene either with or without the fusion to gag. Viruses generated from these two vectors differed greatly in their abilities to transform cells: fusion of v-erb-B with gag enhanced its transforming ability 50 to 100-fold as determined by focus transformation assays and growth in soft agar. Our data suggest that the difference in transforming ability is not due to alterations in transcription or translation but, rather, may result from changes in post-translational modification.","['Bruskin, A', 'Jackson, J', 'Bishop, J M', 'McCarley, D J', 'Schatzman, R C']","['Bruskin A', 'Jackson J', 'Bishop JM', 'McCarley DJ', 'Schatzman RC']","['George-Williams Hooper Foundation, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, gag', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral', '*Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Jan;5(1):15-24.,,,"['CA12705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of these encouraging results, we treated 12 patients with another low-grade B-cell neoplasm, hairy-cell leukemia. The patients received 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) by continuous infusion for seven days. All the patients responded to treatment. Eleven had complete remissions characterized by the normalization of peripheral blood and bone marrow and disappearance of tumor masses. The longest remission has been 3.8 years. None of the patients have relapsed, and the median duration of remission has been 15.5 months. No serious toxic reactions occurred as a result of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine therapy. These results suggest that 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine may be the most effective therapy available for hairy-cell leukemia. The administration of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine resulted in a higher rate of complete remission than is observed with interferon alfa, and it required no maintenance therapy. Its toxicity may be lower than that of deoxycoformycin, and the responses were achieved with single courses of treatment.","['Piro, L D', 'Carrera, C J', 'Carson, D A', 'Beutler, E']","['Piro LD', 'Carrera CJ', 'Carson DA', 'Beutler E']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, Calif.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cladribine', 'Deoxyadenosines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1990/04/19 00:00,1990/04/19 00:01,['1990/04/19 00:00'],"['1990/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199004193221605 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1990 Apr 19;322(16):1117-21. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199004193221605.,,,"['FD-R-000280/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1 RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-range mapping by pulse-field gel electrophoresis indicated that the three mdr genes are closely linked on a genomic DNA segment of approximately 625 kilobases. The gene order and direction of transcription of the three genes were determined and indicate the arrangement (5') mdr3 (3')-(5') mdr1 (3')-(3') mdr2 (5'). Southern blotting analyses of genomic DNA from a panel of independently derived multidrug-resistant cell lines identified mdr gene amplification in 10 of 12 cell lines studied. In individual cell lines showing gene amplification, the copy number of each of the three mdr genes was identical, suggesting that the three mdr genes became amplified as part of a single amplicon in these cells. Although increased expression of all three mdr genes was detected in 2 of 12 cell lines tested, multidrug resistance was associated in 10 of 12 lines with the independent overexpression of either mdr1 (7 of 12) or mdr3 (3 of 12) but not mdr2. mdr1 overexpression was consistently associated with gene amplification, while increased mdr3 expression was detected in certain cell lines that did not show gene amplification. Increased levels of mdr1 mRNA were linked to the overexpression of a P glycoprotein of apparent molecular weight 180,000 to 200,000, whereas increased mdr3 expression resulted in increased expression of a P glycoprotein of molecular weight 160,000 to 180,000. Our results suggest that at least two members of the mouse mdr gene family, mdr1 and mdr3, can independently confer multidrug resistance in the cell lines examined.","['Raymond, M', 'Rose, E', 'Housman, D E', 'Gros, P']","['Raymond M', 'Rose E', 'Housman DE', 'Gros P']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', '*Multigene Family', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.10.4.1642-1651.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Apr;10(4):1642-51. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.4.1642-1651.1990.,,PMC362269,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 29-amino-acid peptide blocked [3H]thymidine uptake 30 to 50% by concanavalin A-stimulated CD4(+)--but not CD8(+)-enriched murine splenocytes. Maximal suppression was detected at 12.5 micrograms (3 microM) to 75 micrograms (19 microM) per ml of growth medium; stimulation of [3H]thymidine uptake was observed at higher peptide concentrations. The synthetic peptide inhibited but did not stimulate [3H]thymidine uptake by mitogen-activated thymocytes and antibody production by splenocytes as determined in a liquid hemolytic plaque assay. Similarities are reported between a consensus sequence of diverse retroviral TMs and a region of alpha interferons shown by others to be important for antiviral and cytostatic properties. The TM sequence-derived synthetic peptide blocked in a nontoxic and sequence-specific manner the release of murine leukemia virus from two chronically infected cell lines. We suggest that some of the biological effects of retroviral TM are mediated through a common pathway shared with alpha interferons.,"['Wegemer, D E', 'Kabat, K G', 'Kloetzer, W S']","['Wegemer DE', 'Kabat KG', 'Kloetzer WS']","['R.

A chimeric construct encoding the human EGF receptor extracellular domain fused to the tyrosine kinase domain of the rat neu cDNA was expressed under the transcriptional control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR promoter. This resulted in higher levels of expression of the chimeric receptor than were previously obtained from the SV40 virus early promoter in the same cells. The chimeric receptor showed strict ligand-dependent tyrosine kinase and signal transducing activities for the induction of growth-regulated biochemical activities and DNA synthesis in resting cells. The ligand-activated cells became morphologically transformed and grew in agar in the presence of EGF and TGF beta as efficiently as did the ligand-independent neu oncogene-transformed cells.

The growth of B lymphoblastoid cell lines, including promyelocytic HL-60, is highly dependent on glutamine, whereas T-cell lines are able to proliferate in glutamine-free media. Such glutamine dependency has a good inverse correlation with the activity of glutamine synthetase. Moreover, glutamine synthetase can be induced in glutamine-deficient media, especially in glutamine-independent cells. In HL-60 cells, glutamine deprivation results in the decrease of both ATP and dATP levels. The addition of adenine to the culture medium abolishes these changes without restoring cell growth, indicating that the effects of glutamine deprivation on cell growth cannot be fully explained by the perturbation of adenine nucleotide pools.","['Kitoh, T', 'Kubota, M', 'Takimoto, T', 'Hashimoto, H', 'Shimizu, T', 'Sano, H', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Kitoh T', 'Kubota M', 'Takimoto T', 'Hashimoto H', 'Shimizu T', 'Sano H', 'Akiyama Y', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041430120 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1990 Apr;143(1):150-3. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041430120.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One progenitor cell population binds to plastic and to pre-formed bone marrow derived stromal layers (P+S+) and gives rise to non-adherent granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC); the other binds to stromal layers but not to plastic (P-S+); both are separable from GM-CFC which are P-S-. We have evaluated the relevance of differential binding properties to marrow repopulation in a murine model. Murine stem cells (spleen colony-forming cells--CFU-S) can be separated into P+S+, P-S+ and P-S- subpopulations by differential adhesion, thus paralleling the progenitor cell subpopulations in human marrow. Post irradiation (850 cGy X-rays) studies have shown that the P+S+ cells are essential for survival and recovery of marrow, spleen and blood cell populations. Also, in a model for purging autografts, we have demonstrated that the leukaemic cells can be separated from P+S+ repopulating cells by exploiting their different binding properties.","['Gordon, M Y', 'Bearpark, A D', 'Clarke, D', 'Dowding, C R']","['Gordon MY', 'Bearpark AD', 'Clarke D', 'Dowding CR']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Separation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/surgery', 'Mice']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Jan;5 Suppl 1:6-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMP dehydrogenase has been purified to homogeneity from MOLT 4F human T-lymphoblast, and the Km values for IMP and NAD were 29 and 54 microM, respectively. The inhibitory mechanisms of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and ribavirin 5'-monophosphate (RMP), the active forms of the antimetabolites tiazofurin and ribavirin, were investigated on the purified enzyme. RMP inhibits competitively with respect to IMP as well as XMP, and the inhibition by TAD was similar to that by NADH, which was uncompetitive with NAD. However, the Ki values of RMP (0.58 microM) and TAD (0.075 microM) were several orders of magnitude lower than those of XMP (85 microM) and NADH (94 microM). Thus, the drugs interact with the two distinct sites of IMP dehydrogenase with much higher affinities than the natural substrates and products. Preincubation of the purified enzyme with RMP enhanced its inhibitory effect in a time-dependent manner, and the enhancement was further increased by the addition of TAD. The combination of tiazofurin and ribavirin exerted a synergistic effect on the growth inhibition in MOLT 4F cells.","['Yamada, Y', 'Goto, H', 'Yoshino, M', 'Ogasawara, N']","['Yamada Y', 'Goto H', 'Yoshino M', 'Ogasawara N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Perfectural Colony, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '131-99-7 (Inosine Monophosphate)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '83285-83-0 (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*isolation & purification', 'Inosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology']",1990/03/09 00:00,1990/03/09 00:01,['1990/03/09 00:00'],"['1990/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(90)90124-V [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(90)90124-v [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Mar 9;1051(3):209-14. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(90)90124-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data suggest that the expression of P-gp is closely associated with drug-resistance in CML.","['Kuwazuru, Y', 'Yoshimura, A', 'Hanada, S', 'Ichikawa, M', 'Saito, T', 'Uozumi, K', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Arima, T', 'Akiyama, S']","['Kuwazuru Y', 'Yoshimura A', 'Hanada S', 'Ichikawa M', 'Saito T', 'Uozumi K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Arima T', 'Akiyama S']","['Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02533.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jan;74(1):24-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02533.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is clear that sufficient numbers of functional glucocorticoid receptors are required to mediate lysis, but whether they do so through the classical model of steroid hormone activation and modulation of gene expression has not been established. In this report we have asked which region(s) of the steroid receptor are important for mediating lysis in leukemic T lymphoblasts. CEM-ICR 27 leukemic lymphoblasts, a clone of CEM cells which lack functional glucocorticoid receptors and therefore are neither lysed by dexamethasone nor capable of showing glutamine synthetase induction, were provided with steroid receptors by DNA transfections of various receptor gene constructs. We measured steroid mediated lysis, receptor number and induction of glutamine synthetase in the transfected cells. Our results provide evidence that the lysis mechanism in the ICR27 lymphoblasts is restored when functional receptor number is restored. The DNA binding region specifying high affinity for GRE sites is required. Lysis is mediated by any steroid that allows for activation of the receptor containing such a region. Our data support the view that steroid-mediated cell death occurs by a process requiring direct interaction of steroid-receptor complexes with the genome.","['Harbour, D V', 'Chambon, P', 'Thompson, E B']","['Harbour DV', 'Chambon P', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem,Journal of steroid biochemistry,0260125,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0022-4731(90)90137-h [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem. 1990 Jan;35(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/0022-4731(90)90137-h.,,,"['1R01-MH-43279-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '41407/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown before that in rat chloroleukaemia cells, maintained in suspension culture in vitro, this element is spontaneously transcriptionally activated at about half of the maximal population density. About 24 h later an explosive amplification of the L1 element is seen in DNA: about 300,000 copies are inserted into apparently random locations in the cell genome, thus creating an outburst of lethal mutations. Dead cells display morphological features typical to programmed death. The present results show that UV light and ionizing radiation induce rapid, premature activation of the L1Rn element during the fast exponential growth of chloroleukaemia cells, and that also this exogenously induced activation is followed by programmed cell death. Transcriptional activation of the L1Rn element can be very strong after the UV exposure: at least 70-fold. Severe hyperthermia, lethal to the cells, does not lead to L1Rn activation (actually a marked suppression is seen) and the mode of phenomic death is necrosis. Some biological implications of the results are discussed.","['Servomaa, K', 'Rytomaa, T']","['Servomaa K', 'Rytomaa T']","['Laboratory of Radiobiology, Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*radiation effects', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*radiation effects', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['TBM47B0HGD04TCKR [pii]', '10.1080/09553009014552441 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1990 Feb;57(2):331-43. doi: 10.1080/09553009014552441.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 effector cells specific for the minor histocompatibility Ag H-40a protects irradiated C.B-20 but not BALB/c recipients. Because C.B-20 donor cells could potentially generate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in BALB/c recipients, we investigated the possibility that GVHD prevents the anti-tumor effect.

GVHD was indicated by the histologic appearance of tissue sections from C.B-20----F1 livers, target organs of GVHD, which showed a marked mononuclear cell infiltrate around the portal tracts and central veins. In addition, splenic lymphocytes from these mice had altered CD4/CD8 ratios and were unable to respond to the polyclonal activators Con A and LPS. The mitogen unresponsiveness was at least partially due to the presence of a suppressor cell, because proliferation of normal spleen cells to Con A and LPS was suppressed upon addition of C.B-20----F1 spleen cells. Further immune dysfunction was evident by the inability of T cells from mice with GVHD to generate a CTL response to H-2 alloantigens. Addition of C.B-20----F1 spleen cells to F1 responder cells at the induction of culture did not prevent generation of CTL, indicating that a suppressor cell was not responsible for the lack of CTL activity. In this setting of GVHD, F1 recipients were able to reject BCL1 upon adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 effector cells.

Partial cDNAs for the human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase were isolated by screening human hepatoma (HepG2) and placental cDNA libraries with the rat liver cDNA for farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase as a probe. Anchored polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate the 5'-end of the cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase cDNA has high identity (86%) to the rat liver cDNA. Treatment of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 with phorbol esters led to 2--7-fold increases in mRNA concentrations for the three cholesterogenic enzymes, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase within 5 h. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled cells demonstrated that there was a corresponding increase in the rate of synthesis of all three proteins. The addition of cycloheximide to cells also led to increases in the mRNA concentrations of the three enzymes. Treatment of cells with phorbol esters and cycloheximide resulted in superinduction of all three mRNAs; HMG-CoA synthase mRNA levels increased 35-fold, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase 17-fold, and HMG-CoA reductase 16-fold 5 h after treatment. The mRNA levels returned to pretreatment levels by 20 h. Cells were also preincubated in the presence of a lipoprotein-deficient fraction of serum plus mevinolin to induce the levels of the three mRNAs. Addition of phorbol esters and cycloheximide to these derepressed cells led to further increases in the mRNA levels for all three enzymes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that THP-1 cells contain a short-lived negative transcription factor which regulates transcription of the FPP synthetase, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase genes. Phorbol esters also regulate these same genes, presumably by modifying a common negative transcription factor and/or by inducing a positive transcription factor(s).","['Wilkin, D J', 'Kutsunai, S Y', 'Edwards, P A']","['Wilkin DJ', 'Kutsunai SY', 'Edwards PA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles 90024-1679.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 2.3.3.10 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase)', 'EC 2.5.1.1 (Dimethylallyltranstransferase)', 'EC 4.1.3.- (Oxo-Acid-Lyases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/analysis', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'DNA Probes', 'Dimethylallyltranstransferase/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/*genetics', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oxo-Acid-Lyases/*genetics', 'Placenta/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transferases/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39606-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Mar 15;265(8):4607-14.,,,['HL 30568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/J05262'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have analyzed protein kinases capable of phosphorylating P-glycoprotein in membranes of HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine. Analysis of this system demonstrates that in isolated membranes the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine greatly reduces P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. In contrast, the kinase inhibitor H-7 does not affect this reaction. Fractionation of solubilized membrane proteins from sensitive and resistant cells on DEAE-cellulose reveals a major protein kinase (PK-1) which exhibits optimal activity in the presence of Mn2+ and histone H1. This enzyme fraction does not contain detectable levels of protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. PK-1 phosphorylation of two endogenous proteins is, however, greatly enhanced in the presence of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidyl-inositol. In reaction mixtures containing Mg2+ or Mn2+ in the absence of phospholipid, PK-1 from resistant cells phosphorylates an endogenous protein of 180 kilodaltons (P180), which exhibits an electrophoretic mobility identical to P-glycoprotein. In parallel experiments with PK-1 from sensitive cells there is no detectable phosphorylation of a P180 protein. P180 phosphorylated by PK-1 from resistant cells is immunoprecipitated by antibody against P-glycoprotein. Additional studies demonstrate that PK-1 is capable of phosphorylating specific synthetic peptides which correspond to the sequence of P-glycoprotein. Peptide phosphorylation occurs at both serine and threonine residues. These studies thus identify a novel membrane-associated protein kinase in HL60 cells which is capable of phosphorylating P-glycoprotein. This enzyme may have an important role in regulating levels of multidrug resistance.","['Staats, J', 'Marquardt, D', 'Center, M S']","['Staats J', 'Marquardt D', 'Center MS']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Phospholipids/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1990/03/05 00:00,1990/03/05 00:01,['1990/03/05 00:00'],"['1990/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39705-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Mar 5;265(7):4084-90.,,,['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pump is composed of a 170-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) that is encoded by the so-called mdr1 gene. The functionally relevant characteristic of MDR cells is a defect in drug accumulation that can be restored by agents which inhibit the P-glycoprotein pump. The purpose of our study was to find out whether P-glycoprotein inhibitors could increase the daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells, overexpressing the mdr1 gene. Using dot blot analysis with an mdr1-specific cDNA probe, we identified leukemic cell samples, obtained from chemotherapy-resistant AML patients, that had relatively high levels of mdr1 expression. These leukemic cells showed a reduced ability to accumulate DNR in vitro, as quantitated by flow cytometry. Addition of cyclosporin-A (Cy-A), a drug known to inhibit the P-glycoprotein pump, to the incubation medium resulted in an increase (up to 60%) in steady-state drug uptake by the leukemic cells. The degree of Cy-A-induced increase in drug accumulation in the leukemic cells correlated approximately with the level of overexpression of the mdr1 gene. Our data indicate that Cy-A is a good candidate for combination chemotherapy with cytotoxic drugs in clinical trials, aimed at the treatment of drug resistance in AML.","['Nooter, K', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Oostrum, R', 'Herweijer, H', 'Hagenbeek, T', 'Valerio, D']","['Nooter K', 'Sonneveld P', 'Oostrum R', 'Herweijer H', 'Hagenbeek T', 'Valerio D']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910450210 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Feb 15;45(2):263-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910450210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identical E2A-prl mRNA junctions were detected by PCR in three t(1;19)-carrying cell lines, indicating that the fusion transcripts and predicted chimeric protein are a consistent feature of this translocation.","['Nourse, J', 'Mellentin, J D', 'Galili, N', 'Wilkinson, J', 'Stanbridge, E', 'Smith, S D', 'Cleary, M L']","['Nourse J', 'Mellentin JD', 'Galili N', 'Wilkinson J', 'Stanbridge E', 'Smith SD', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/02/23 00:00,1990/02/23 00:01,['1990/02/23 00:00'],"['1990/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(90)90657-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(90)90657-z [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1990 Feb 23;60(4):535-45. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(90)90657-z.,,,"['5T32 CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/A33061', 'GENBANK/B33061', 'GENBANK/M31170', 'GENBANK/M31222']",,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells do not however overexpress mdr1 and do not contain detectable levels of P-glycoprotein. In the present study we have prepared antisera against synthetic peptides that correspond to various sequence domains of P-glycoprotein and have examined by Western blot analysis the reactivity of these antisera with proteins contained in membranes of HL60/Adr cells. All antisera are highly reactive with a Mr 180,000 (p180) P-glycoprotein contained in membranes of HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine (HL60/Vinc). In contrast, of 13 antisera tested 12 do not react with any resistance-associated protein in the HL60/Adr isolate. One antiserum (ASP14) is however highly reactive with a Mr 190,000 protein (p190) contained in HL60/Adr membranes. This protein is not detected in drug-sensitive cells. ASP14 also reacts with proteins p195 and p50 contained in a second independent HL60/Adr isolate. Analysis of membrane subfractions shows that p190 is located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum with only low levels contained in plasma membranes. Additional studies demonstrate that endoplasmic reticulum of HL60/Adr cells contain a major Mr 190,000 protein that is capable of binding the photoaffinity agent 8-azido[alpha-32P]ATP. p195 contained in a second HL60/Adr isolate is also labeled with 8-azido[alpha-32P]ATP. These results thus demonstrate that antiserum against a specific P-glycoprotein sequence detects a p190 (p195) resistance-associated membrane protein in two independent HL60/Adr isolates. p190 (p195) and P-glycoprotein thus contain a minor sequence homology and based on the specificity of ASP14 this occurs in a region which may be involved in nucleotide binding. Possibly this sequence is common to and essential for the functionality of proteins which contribute to resistance by reducing cellular drug levels.","['Marquardt, D', 'McCrone, S', 'Center, M S']","['Marquardt D', 'McCrone S', 'Center MS']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antibodies', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Mar 1;50(5):1426-30.,,,['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilizing two mechanism-based strategies, we have designed and prepared potential DHO inhibitor analogues of CA. One strategy replaced the gamma-carboxyl moiety of CA with a boronic acid. This substitution yields compounds which form stable charged tetrahedral intermediates and mimic the enzyme-substrate transition state. Preparation of the boronic acid analogues of CA and its carboxylic acid esters focused on a Curtius rearrangement as a key step following a malonic ester synthesis. This was followed by carbamoylation of the free amine under nonaqueous neutral conditions with Si(NCO)4. The ethyl ester was a competitive inhibitor of DHO with an apparent Ki of 5.07 microM, while the nonesterified analogue and the methyl ester were not effective inhibitors.

The differentiated cells have acquired a suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte phenotype characterized by reactivity with maturation-specific monoclonal antibodies. Coadministration of guanosine and hypoxanthine reduces the growth inhibition and diminishes the induction of differentiation by either MPA or TZ. No such reduction was observed for differentiation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), another inducer of a suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype in CEM-2 cells. During the first 2 days of treatment with MPA or TZ, a pattern of stable IMPDH mRNA levels and increased amounts of cellular enzyme was observed, perhaps, because of compensation for the inhibitor-mediated decrease in cellular IMPDH activity or a MPA- or TZ-mediated decrease in proteolysis of IMPDH. PMA treatment decreased the levels of IMPDH mRNA, protein, and activity. In addition, treatment of CEM-2 cells with either IMPDH inhibitors or PMA caused different alterations of the ribonucleotide pools. The lack of a consistent pattern of IMPDH expression in CEM-2 cells treated with IMPDH inhibitors or PMA indicates that no general association exists between the induction of cell differentiation and the expression of IMPDH. Nevertheless, our results indicating that IMPDH inhibitors can induce differentiation in CEM-2 cells suggest that this treatment may provide a useful approach to circumvent the differentiation block in some tumor cells.","['Kiguchi, K', 'Collart, F R', 'Henning-Chubb, C', 'Huberman, E']","['Kiguchi K', 'Collart FR', 'Henning-Chubb C', 'Huberman E']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439-4833.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(90)90114-P [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(90)90114-p [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1990 Mar;187(1):47-53. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(90)90114-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taxol caused a relative increase in the fraction of 4C interphase and metaphase cells in both lines although the 4C interphase accumulation was greater for the resistant K562 line.

The capacity of K562 cells to generate polyploidy in response to taxol correlated with taxol resistance by previous assay and may be a useful indicator of drug resistance.","['Roberts, J R', 'Allison, D C', 'Donehower, R C', 'Rowinsky, E K']","['Roberts JR', 'Allison DC', 'Donehower RC', 'Rowinsky EK']","['Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Paclitaxel', '*Polyploidy', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Feb 1;50(3):710-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alpha subunits of G proteins bind to guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) in the unstimulated state and guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP) in the active state. Tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide), a specific inhibitor of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, decreases guanylate synthesis from IMP in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and depletes intracellular guanine nucleotide pools. This study demonstrates that treatment of HL-60 cells with tiazofurin is associated with a fourfold increase in membrane binding sites for the nonhydrolyzable analogue GDP beta S. This increase in binding sites was associated with a 3.2-fold decrease in GDP beta S binding affinity. Similar findings were obtained with GTP gamma S. These effects of tiazofurin treatment on guanine nucleotide binding were also associated with decreased adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation of specific G protein substrates by cholera and pertussis toxin. The results further demonstrate that tiazofurin treatment results in inhibition of G protein-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms. In this regard, stimulation of adenylate cyclase by prostaglandin E2 was inhibited by over 50% in tiazofurin-treated cells. Furthermore, tiazofurin treatment resulted in inhibition of N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced stimulation of phospholipase C. Taken together, these results indicate that tiazofurin acts at least in part by inhibiting the ability of G proteins to function as transducers of intracellular signals.","['Kharbanda, S M', 'Sherman, M L', 'Kufe, D W']","['Kharbanda SM', 'Sherman ML', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85740-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 1;75(3):583-8.,,,"['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the early stages of this induction, steady-state levels of cellular IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH), messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein are increased, perhaps because of cellular compensation for the inhibition of IMPDH activity. The subsequent decrease in IMPH mRNA and protein levels after several days of treatment suggests a change in the control of IMPDH expression. In contrast to the pattern of increased IMPDH expression observed in the mycophenolic acid-treated cells, treatment of HL-60 cells with two other inducers of differentiation, namely retinoic acid and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, resulted in stable or decreased levels of cellular IMPDH mRNA and protein. However, the kinetics of this expression were different. These results suggest that a number of factors influence the regulation of IMPDH expression during the induction of HL-60 cell differentiation, including the nature of the inducer. A decrease in the cellular IMPDH activity was observed for all of the inducers, suggesting that this decreased activity may be a determining factor in the acquisition of a mature phenotype in the HL-60 cells.","['Collart, F R', 'Huberman, E']","['Collart FR', 'Huberman E']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, IL 60493-4833.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Mycophenolic Acid/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/enzymology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85738-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 1;75(3):570-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two homologous chromosomes 11 containing the alleles of the Tk gene in L5178Y 3.7.2C TK+/- cells are distinguishable at the cytogenetic level. We find, in addition, that the two alleles are distinguishable at the molecular level because of an Nco I restriction fragment length polymorphism at the 3' end of the gene. In a set of 51 large-colony and 48 small-colony TK-/- mutants induced by ionizing radiation or by chemical mutagens, we find that 78, including all except one of the small-colony mutants, have lost the Tk+ allele and that some of these have two to four copies of the remaining Tk- allele. Nineteen of the large-colony TK-/- mutants that do not show Tk+ allele loss show no other structural changes detectable at the level of Southern blot analysis. One shows a partial deletion.

Retroviral induction of T cell dysfunction in MAIDS is thus dependent on the presence of B cells, and high level virus expression in mice without B cells has little or no effect on T cell function.","['Cerny, A', 'Hugin, A W', 'Hardy, R R', 'Hayakawa, K', 'Zinkernagel, R M', 'Makino, M', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Cerny A', 'Hugin AW', 'Hardy RR', 'Hayakawa K', 'Zinkernagel RM', 'Makino M', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*microbiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.171.1.315 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Jan 1;171(1):315-20. doi: 10.1084/jem.171.1.315.,,PMC2187666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blot analysis of cells revealed the increased expression of a glycoprotein of 170-180 kDa (P-glycoprotein) in P388/ADR cells as compared with P388/0 cells, which is consistent with the findings of other studies. A modulation of the membrane morphology of in vitro P388/ADR cells was evident from one i.p. in vivo passage for 10 days, by a reversion to the non-ruffled sensitive-cell morphology. Long-term P388/ADR culture cells showed a reduction in membrane folding with as little as a 4-h exposure to the peritoneal ascitic fluid obtained when the tumor was harvested. However, there was no alteration in the expression of P-glycoprotein or in the sensitivity to Adriamycin in either of the P388 cell lines when grown in vivo or when exposed to ascites fluid from an i.p. tumor.

The ability to overcome resistance varied considerably with the nature of substituents at positions 3.5 of the 1,4-dihydropyridine, and the most suitable substituents were the pyridylalkyl-including esters. Calcium antagonistic activity of NK-compounds having pyridylalkyl-including esters at positions 3.5 and dithiene ring at position 4 of the 1,4-dihydropyridine was greater than in those compounds having the dioxene ring at position 4. NK-242, which was assessed at Grade A and had no calcium antagonistic activity, improved therapeutic effects in both VCR-sensitive (P388/S) leukemia- and P388/VCR leukemia-bearing mice when combined with VCR.

At onset, Gly (GGT) was changed to Ser (AGT) at codon 12, and at relapse, Gly (GGT) to Asp (GAT) was observed at the same codon. In addition, the DNA at relapse showed a remarkably higher transforming activity than the DNA at onset on two independent recipient cell lines. The identical cell surface phenotype and the same rearrangement patterns of both the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain and T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma chain genes indicated that the leukemic cells at onset and those at relapse were derived from the same precursor cell.

Given these results, the possible utility of DEC in treatment of retroviral and other infections warrants further study.","['Kitchen, L W', 'Mather, F J', 'Chapple, F E', 'Bilello, J A']","['Kitchen LW', 'Mather FJ', 'Chapple FE', 'Bilello JA']","['Section of Infectious Diseases, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV 25703.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Scotland,J Clin Lab Immunol,Journal of clinical & laboratory immunology,7808987,['V867Q8X3ZD (Diethylcarbamazine)'],IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/pathology/prevention & control', 'Diethylcarbamazine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Lab Immunol. 1990 Nov;33(3):97-105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biologically active form is arabinosyl thymidine triphosphate (Ara-TTP), which inhibits cellular and viral DNA-polymerases and thus interferes with DNA replication. Using two murine erythroleukemia cell lines, Friend cell clone F4-6 and F4-12N, the latter being thymidine kinase deficient (TK-) cells transformed to a TK+ phenotype with the HSV TK gene, we have determined 1) the role of cellular and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK) in the uptake of Ara-T into the cells; 2) the subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular Ara-T to Ara-TMP, Ara-TDP and Ara-TTP; 3) the incorporation of Ara-TTP into the DNA. Incorporation into DNA was studied under different conditions, including selective inhibition of the different cellular DNA polymerases by aphidicolin (that inhibits polymerases alpha and delta) and dideoxythymidine (that preferentially inhibits polymerases beta and gamma). The uptake of Ara-T into the methanol soluble pool of the cells depends upon its phosphorylation to Ara-TMP, which is more efficiently performed by the HSV TK than by the cellular TK, thus explaining the sensitivity of HSV infected cells to Ara-T. However, using increasing concentrations of Ara-T, we have shown that phosphorylation also occurs in normal control cells due to the cellular thymidine kinase. More than 90% of Ara-T is phosphorylated in the cell, and more than 60% of total Ara-T(MP, DP, TP) exists in the triphosphate form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dahmen, N', 'Kowalzick, L', 'Spadari, S', 'Koch, G']","['Dahmen N', 'Kowalzick L', 'Spadari S', 'Koch G']","['Physiologisch Chemisches Institut, Universitat Hamburg, Abteilung fur Molekularbiologie, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'NS9U4BEG7Y (thymine arabinoside)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Aphidicolin', 'Arabinonucleosides/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/genetics', 'Thymidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tritium']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1990 Jan-Feb;4(1):25-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of extracellular nucleotides in the regulation of beta-glucuronidase release in HL-60 cells. In dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-differentiated HL-60 cells, the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), the phosphorothioate analogue of ATP, adenosine 5'-O-[3-thio]triphosphate (ATP[gamma S]), and UTP increased cytosolic Ca2+ from 100 nM up to 1.2 microM with EC50 values of 4 nM, 1 microM and 100 nM, respectively. In these cells, ATP[gamma S] induced exocytosis with an EC50 of 4 microM and an effectiveness amounting to 50-70% of that of fMet-Leu-Phe. ATP, ITP, UTP, CTP, and uridine 5'-O-[2-thio]diphosphate activated exocytosis as well. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced exocytosis with an EC50 of 115 ng/ml and an effectiveness similar to that of ATP[gamma S]. Cytochalasin B (CB) differently potentiated exocytosis induced by ATP[gamma S], fMet-Leu-Phe and PMA. Treatment of Bt2cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells with pertussis toxin (500 ng/ml) for 24 h resulted in ADP-ribosylation of more than 97.5% of the G-proteins. Under these conditions, pertussis toxin almost completely inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and beta-glucuronidase release induced by fMet-Leu-Phe but only partially inhibited the effects of ATP[gamma S] and UTP. fMet-Leu-Phe at a non-stimulatory concentration (1 nM) potentiated ATP[gamma S]-induced beta-glucuronidase release in the presence but not in the absence of CB. In contrast, ATP[gamma S] and fMet-Leu-Phe synergistically activated superoxide formation in the absence of CB. PMA potentiated superoxide formation induced by ATP[gamma S] or fMet-Leu-Phe and did not affect exocytosis induced by ATP[gamma S] or fMet-Leu-Phe. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, fMet-Leu-Phe, ATP[gamma S], UTP and PMA did not induce beta-glucuronidase release. fMet-Leu-Phe did not increase cytosolic Ca2+ in undifferentiated HL-60 cells, whereas ATP[gamma S] and UTP were similarly potent and effective as in Bt2cAMP-differentiated cells. In differentiated HL-60 cells, fMet-Leu-Phe induced aggregation, and ATP[gamma S] induced a transient shape change.

Results showed significant protection at 25 and 50 j/cm2 (p less than 0.05), but at 75 j/cm2 irradiation only the 750 mg/kg dosage remained protective. The protective factor of WR-2721 is 1.65 (95% confidence interval: 1.38-1.99) WR-2721 is protective against photodynamic lesions but this protection is diminished by increased irradiation energy.

Urethane leukaemia virus (ULV) injected into adult BALB/c mice (10(5) focus-forming units/mouse) caused a small, significant splenomegaly from 2 to at least 9 weeks after virus inoculation. Virus was also present in up to 60% nucleated splenocytes (XC 'infectious centre assay'). Effects on splenomegaly and virus in splenocytes were assayed following various regimens of zidovudine given as 0.5 mg/ml or 0.25 mg/ml in drinking water. Regimens included continuous treatment both before and after ULV, only before, and only after ULV inoculation. Zidovudine was also given for a limited period immediately after virus, or initiated after virus infection was established. Zidovudine given continuously at and following ULV infection completely prevented splenomegaly and virus expression in splenocytes. No other regimen was as effective; however, limited zidovudine treatment immediately after virus inoculation greatly reduced the effects of virus, while the same dose initiated after virus infection was established had only a small ameliorating effect. We conclude that ULV may prove to be a useful addition to other available murine systems, and this is discussed.","['Harvey, J J', 'Tuffrey, M', 'Wedderburn, N', 'Alexander, F', 'Curtis, J', 'Taylor-Robinson, D', 'Dore, C']","['Harvey JJ', 'Tuffrey M', 'Wedderburn N', 'Alexander F', 'Curtis J', 'Taylor-Robinson D', 'Dore C']","['Division of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, MRC Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J STD AIDS,International journal of STD & AIDS,9007917,['4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)'],IM,,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Retroviridae/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Spleen/anatomy & histology', 'Splenomegaly/drug therapy', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/095646249000100510 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J STD AIDS. 1990 Sep;1(5):349-56. doi: 10.1177/095646249000100510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reverse transcriptase activity in the culture fluids was reduced by 80-90% when the cells (HTLV-III B/H9) were cultivated in the presence of 0.5 microM (-)-arctigenin or 1 microM (-)-trachelogenin. At the same concentrations, the formation of syncytia in the HTLV-III B/H9-Jurkat cell system was inhibited by the compounds by more than 80%. A series of other lignan type compounds displayed no anti-HIV activity. Studying the molecular mechanism of action of (-)-arctigenin and (-)-trachelogenin we found that both compounds are efficient inhibitors of the nuclear matrix-associated DNA topoisomerase II activity, particularly of the enzyme from HIV-1-infected cells.

In contrast to the second week, the fifth week of infection showed a 94% increase of plasma ACTH which then dropped back down to 38% after the sixth and seventh weeks. This opposing biphasic pattern of change was also observed in the plasma cortisol content of the infected cats.

Neutralizing antibodies and antibodies binding to the viral capsid protein were present in most animals early after infection, often before BLV-expressing cells were first detected in blood. Neutralizing antibodies increased rapidly during the period when the number of cells that expressed BLV was also increasing. However, the titers developed by individual animals were independent of the maximum number of BLV-expressing cells. Antibodies that bound to the viral surface glycoprotein on immunoblots became evident at the same time as large peaks in the numbers of BLV-expressing cells. Despite ensuing sharp drops in BLV-expressing cells, neutralizing titers remained relatively constant through the rest of the first 8 months after infection. Two early phases of BLV replication were thus defined: initial, low-level replication that induced neutralizing and capsid-specific antibodies followed by a second period of intense replication that induced sharp increases in antiviral antibodies and preceded the release of many infected cells into the blood.","['Radke, K', 'Grossman, D', 'Kidd, L C']","['Radke K', 'Grossman D', 'Kidd LC']","['Department of Avian Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Giant Cells/cytology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Sheep', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0882-4010(90)90019-M [pii]', '10.1016/0882-4010(90)90019-m [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1990 Sep;9(3):159-71. doi: 10.1016/0882-4010(90)90019-m.,,,"['CA-40653/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, throughout the rest of the first 8 months, sharply reduced numbers of cells transcribed BLV or produced virus.

Differentiation was accompanied by the expression and secretion of a plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). Incubation of the cells in the presence of other agents (dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, vitamin D3) capable of inducing differentiation towards other phenotypes did not lead to the induction of PAI expression. The inhibitor induced by PMA was partially purified and it exhibited biochemical characteristics similar to PAI-2. The molecule is a glycoprotein with a pI of 5.8. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from control and PMA-treated cells revealed the presence of an approximately 2-kilobase mRNA from treated cells that hybridized to a PAI-2-specific synthetic oligonucleotide. This mRNA did not hybridize with a PAI-I-specific oligonucleotide and was absent from control cells. These observations are consistent with the literature regarding PAI-2 expression by cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage.

The monosomy 7 was the sole anomaly in nine patients and was associated with other chromosome changes in four. A group of 19 patients with similar diseases but with normal karyotype or with anomalies not involving chromosome 7 served as control. beta-galactosidase and arylsulphatase A, whose genes are not on chromosome 7, were tested as control enzymes. We obtained evidence for a gene dosage effect for GUSB, but not for PSP. When all cases with monosomy 7 were compared with controls, no dosage effect was observed for PSP, but when this group was split into two, according to the presence of anomalies additional to the monosomy 7, the values of activity in the group with additional anomalies were significantly lower than in the controls. Thus, in the case of PSP, the loss of one allele is not followed immediately by reduction in activity, and this could be due to the specific importance of PSP in nucleic acid metabolism. We postulate that some regulatory mechanisms are able to keep normal levels of PSP even in the presence of only one allele, and that they are overwhelmed only when additional chromosome changes are present. These changes tend to involve chromosomes carrying genes for enzymes involved in a metabolic pathway closely related to PSP functions, and only then is a gene dosage effect for PSP detectable.","['Minelli, A', 'Piantanida, M', 'Maserati, E', 'Campagnoli, E', 'Pasquali, F', 'Danesino, C']","['Minelli A', 'Piantanida M', 'Maserati E', 'Campagnoli E', 'Pasquali F', 'Danesino C']","['Biologia Generale e Genetica Medica, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.3 (phosphoserine phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glucuronidase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', '*Monosomy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2870010305 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1990 Jan;1(3):216-20. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870010305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex DNA rearrangements were characterized in the TCR alpha/delta locus. Besides a productive V alpha/J alpha assembly found on the normal allele, two deletions within the J alpha cluster were identified in the translocated allele. The translocation breakpoints involved the TCR delta gene on chromosome 14 and the SCL locus on chromosome band Ip32 that was recently shown to be activated by the t(1;14) translocation of the DU 528 leukemic cell line. Significantly, both Kd and DU 528 translocation breakpoints were located at the boundaries of D delta or J delta segments and were clustered in a 10 kb genomic fragment of the SCL gene. The presence of recombination signal motifs (heptamer-12/23 bp spacer-nonamer) on both normal chromosome partners, and N nucleotide addition on both derivative chromosomes involved the recombinase system in the translocation event. The SCL locus was highly expressed as a 5 kb transcript in Kd cells and, as already reported, as a 2 kb transcript in DU 528 cells. Importantly, a 5 kb SCL transcript was also detected in immature nonlymphoid hematopoietic cells but not in normal mature T cells, suggesting that it might correspond to the normal SCL transcript. Taken together, our data support the notion that the involvement of the SCL gene in the leukemogenic process may occur through overexpression of an apparently normal transcript (Kd cells) or expression of a truncated RNA (DU 528 cells).","['Bernard, O', 'Guglielmi, P', 'Jonveaux, P', 'Cherif, D', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Berger, R', 'Larsen, C J', 'Mathieu-Mahul, D']","['Bernard O', 'Guglielmi P', 'Jonveaux P', 'Cherif D', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Berger R', 'Larsen CJ', 'Mathieu-Mahul D']","['U301 INSERM CNRS, Institute de Genetique Moleculaire, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinases)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (integron integrase IntI1)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', '*Integrases', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombinases', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2870010303 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1990 Jan;1(3):194-208. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870010303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This strategy predicts that neoplasms arising from drug-sensitive cells might be safely treatable with tumor-eradicative drug doses because the presence of a modicum of drug-insensitive stem cells will protect vital tissues from lethal depopulation. To test this prediction, lymphomas were induced with Abelson leukemia virus in mice bearing a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) transgene selectively expressed in lymphoid cells. Of 12 transgenic mice treated with the HSV-TK-specific substrate ganciclovir (GCV), 11 exhibited complete tumor regressions; 5 of these mice remained tumor-free over observation periods that exceeded 100 days. Among the lymphomas that recurred, most appeared to represent mutant subpopulations that were GCV-insensitive because they had lost HSV-TK, implying that independent insertion of multiple HSV-TK gene copies might provide a means of preventing recurrences. The results of this study demonstrate that chemosensitivity genes can enhance the efficacy of treatment in hosts who subsequently develop a neoplasm. While the use of a germ-line gene insertion model precludes direct human application, the results also imply the merits of exploring an alternative version of the strategy in which somatic insertion of chemosensitivity genes in mosaic fashion is used prophylactically to enhance the prospect that a subsequent tumor will respond to therapy.","['Moolten, F L', 'Wells, J M', 'Heyman, R A', 'Evans, R M']","['Moolten FL', 'Wells JM', 'Heyman RA', 'Evans RM']","['Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital, Bedford, MA 01730.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Ganciclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1990.1.2-125 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1990 Summer;1(2):125-34. doi: 10.1089/hum.1990.1.2-125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, NF-kappa B activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes. The ability of both mitogens and cytokines to activate NF-kappa B was also blocked in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing Tax. However, the activation of other mitogen-inducible transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, was unaffected. Thus, depending on the cellular environment, the short- and long-term effects of Tax expression can be quite different.

Administration of AZT alone or in combination with IFN alpha, beginning at the time of exposure to a 100% persistent viremia-inducing dose of FeLV-FAIDS, abrogated the progression of viral infection and protected treated animals from induction of persistent antigenemia and disease. Low levels of antigenemia were detected intermittently in some AZT-treated cats throughout the 6 week treatment and 40 week observation period. Combination of AZT with IFN alpha appeared even more effective than AZT alone. In this treatment group even transient antigenemia was undetectable throughout the therapy and posttherapy observation periods, and latent virus could not be reactivated from bone marrow cells of protected animals. These results provide additional evidence that early treatment with AZT or AZT/IFN alpha therapy can be effective in completely aborting retroviral infections.","['Hoover, E A', 'Zeidner, N S', 'Mullins, J I']","['Hoover EA', 'Zeidner NS', 'Mullins JI']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Cats', 'Drug Combinations', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb17846.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1990;616:258-69. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb17846.x.,,,['N01-AI-72663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimized HL medium was a mixture of RPMI-1640, DMEM, HamF12 and IMDM media supplemented with transferrin, insulin, Primatone RL, Pluronic F68, ethanolamine and selenite. Under these conditions, whether serum was added or not, cells grew to up to 8 x 10(6) cells ml-1, which was at least three times higher than the maximum cell density usually described. Glucose and four amino acids: cystine, glutamine, methionine and serine, were highly consumed and disappeared quickly from the medium. Nutrient supply and metabolic end-product accumulation were the most probable growth-limiting factors. Different propagation systems were used to increase the cell density further. Cells were grown in dialysis tubing where relatively high levels of nutrients and low levels of waste products were maintained, leading to cell densities of 60 x 10(6) to 70 x 10(6) cells ml-1.

Until recently, all human leukemia lines were grown in fetal bovine serum and were not dependent on exogenous hemopoietic growth factors.

Recently, factor-dependent cell lines were established from patients with acute leukemias which are absolutely dependent on growth factors for in vitro proliferation and survival. These cells were derived from different primary leukemia phenotypes, and exhibit heterogeneous growth and differentiation responses. Like the murine growth factor-dependent cell lines which preceded them, these new human lines are important models for growth factor signal transduction as well as proliferative responses and differentiation.

The comparative features amongst these animal retroviruses and those of humans must be recognized by the veterinary and medical professions since the similarities in virus replication and spread by blood transfer can provide important clues in controlling and perhaps preventing human retroviruses infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus.","['Evermann, J F']",['Evermann JF'],"['Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine and Surgery, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6610.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",7808924,,IM,,"['Animals', '*Animals, Domestic', 'Arthritis-Encephalitis Virus, Caprine/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/microbiology/transmission/*veterinary', 'Visna-maedi virus/physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0147-9571(90)90275-X [pii]', '10.1016/0147-9571(90)90275-x [doi]']",ppublish,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990;13(3):127-36. doi: 10.1016/0147-9571(90)90275-x.,,,,,,,82,,,,,,,,,

However, new interest was shown on the bovine visna-like virus after the isolation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), because of the urgent need for developing animal models for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The purpose of this paper is to describe the different stages of the identification of the bovine virus and to up-date knowledge about it. The bovine visna-like virus has recently been named the bovine immuno-deficiency-like virus (BIV) and is the sole bovine lentivirus known to-date. BIV shares morphologic, antigenic and genomic characteristics with other lentiviruses. It grows and induces large syncytia in vitro and generates virus-productive and latent infections in cell culture. It causes persistent infection and slow progressive disease in cattle and probably in sheep. As target cells of the virus are leukocytes, the type of which is unknown, perturbations of the immune system are expected. Consequently, BIV may potentiate the occurrence of secondary infections and play a role in retroviral, multiple infections. It is not oncogenic. Transmission appears to occur in cattle by contact, but evidence of transmission in human beings has not been shown. Finally, BIV may be a potential model in vitro and in vivo for HIV and AIDS.","['Bouillant, A M', 'Archambault, D']","['Bouillant AM', 'Archambault D']","['Agriculture Canada, Institut de recherches veterinaires, Nepean, Ontario, Canada.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Rech Vet,Annales de recherches veterinaires.

Response rates in most of these trials reach or exceed 50%, indicating increased activity of chemotherapy in NSCLC when used at an earlier time in the natural history of the disease, as has been shown in other diseases. In addition, histologic confirmation of complete response can occasionally be achieved. Most of the studies reviewed here have included patients with unresectable disease, who would now frequently be classified as stage IIIB. For these patient cohorts the survival data reported are frequently disappointing, suggesting that the high response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy do not necessarily translate into improved survival of the patients. On the other hand, where patients with stage IIIA disease were treated and surgery was included in the overall treatment plan, the survival data are more encouraging. Although most chemotherapy regimens have included cisplatin, it is not clear which combination of drugs and which schedules are superior. Clinical research, therefore, clearly needs to continue to focus on the development of innovative drug combinations and the evaluation of new drugs in NSCLC in an attempt to further increase overall and complete response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At the same time, randomized studies are needed to unequivocally establish whether the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to standard therapy improves survival for stage IIIA and/or stage IIIB NSCLC as compared with standard therapy alone. Results from one such randomized study, which was conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), have recently been reported. One-hundred and eighty patients with unresectable NSCLC were randomized to receive radiotherapy alone or two cycles of cisplatin and vinblastine followed by radiotherapy. One-hundred and fifty-five eligible patients were analyzed for response. Of 77 patients receiving radiotherapy alone, 43% responded, including 16% with a complete response. Of 78 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 56% responded to both treatment modalities, including 19% with complete response. With a median follow-up of 19 months, the median survival was 16.5 months for patients receiving combined modality therapy and 8.5 months for patients receiving radiotherapy alone. The pattern of relapse was identical in both study arms, showing a predominance of local recurrence or of combined local and distant recurrence, whereas few patients experienced distant disease progression alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Vokes, E E']",['Vokes EE'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Dec;4(6):1133-42.,,,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,

Ascorbic acid had no effect on the antitumor activity of ADR in mice inoculated with leukemia L1210 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, but it significantly prolonged the life of animals treated with ADR. ADR elevated lipid peroxide levels in mouse heart, and ascorbic acid prevented the elevation. The significant prevention of ADR-induced cardiomyopathy in guinea pigs by ascorbic acid was proved by electron microscopy.

The results obtained provide evidence that both the precursor and the processed molecules are oligomeric and probably form tetramers. Pulse-chase analyses indicate that assembly occurs sequentially, within 30 min of protein synthesis and prior to cleavage of the precursor. Studies using chimeric envelope glycoproteins and deletion mutants indicate that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are not essential for the formation of oligomers. Evidence is also presented that the SU subunit remains in an oligomeric form following disassociation from the TM subunit. Oligomeric envelope glycoprotein complexes linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds were also observed under certain conditions. Mink cell focus-forming virus envelope glycoprotein constructs lacking the transmembrane domain or both the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains formed intermolecular disulfide bonds more readily than the full-length molecule, suggesting that these regions are likely to make a contribution to the conformation of the glycoprotein.

Trained observers recorded significantly fewer pain- and anxiety-related behaviors in the midazolam group immediately before and after, but not during the procedures.

Progeny was registered and fertility evaluated among survivors who passed age 18 years without a relapse (n = 299). By April 1989, 48 offspring were registered, one of whom had congenital anomalies. This was no more than expected from the incidence of birth defects in the general population. No childhood malignancies or genetic diseases have so far been diagnosed in the progeny. In the study group, none of the 19 female and 8 male survivors of myeloid leukemias had become parents, and only 4 fathers were reported among the 131 male survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, 23 of the 149 females treated for ALL had delivered 41 children. Fertility was measured as cumulative rates of first birth by maternal age. In a Cox regression analysis, cases who had received prophylactic radiation of the central nervous system (CNS) had a lower first birth rate than those without radiation (rate ratio 0.39, 95% CI 0.15-1.00), indicating that doses of 18-24 Gy to the brain may possibly be a risk factor. By using the Norwegian birth cohort of 1966 as a control group, matching the median year of birth for the study subjects, the group of female ALL survivors as a whole was as likely as the general female population to have given birth up to the age of 23.

Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein which controls red blood cell production. Recombinant human erythropoietin, 50 U/kg/day, was given subcutaneously to 16 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia. All but one patient was transfusion dependent. Diverse pretreatment endogenous serum erythropoietin levels were noted and ranged from 17 to 3616 IU/l. Two patients (12.5%) demonstrated an improvement in hemoglobin levels obviating the need for transfusions. Their responses lasted 5+ and 7 months with maintenance erythropoietin treatment. The responders had endogenous serum erythropoietin levels of 44 and 170, respectively. Treatment was generally tolerated without constitutional side-effects. However, three patients developed thrombocytopenia and one developed joint pain and leukocytosis on treatment. Overall, six patients showed changes in non-erythroid cells: two patients had an increase in platelet counts; three patients, a decrease in platelet counts; and one patient, an increase in white blood cell counts. Most of these changes reversed rapidly once erythropoietin was stopped. It is concluded that (a) serum erythropoietin levels are extremely variable in anemia patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, (b) only a minority of patients benefit from treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin, and (c) erythropoietin can affect cells of the myeloid and megakaryocytic lineage in a small proportion of patients.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Talpaz, M', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Estrov, Z', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Kurzrock R', 'Talpaz M', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Estrov Z', 'Gutterman JU']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, U.T.

The percentage of marrow blasts in S phase (labeling index, LI) was increased in five patients (1.3-, 1.5-, 1.9-, 2.3- and 3.2-fold change). The increase in LI was similar 24 and 48 h after beginning GM-CSF. The RNA Index also increased in patients who showed an increased LI, suggesting that GM-CSF had recruited quiescent neoplastic cells into the cell cycle. Forty eight hours after beginning GM-CSF, chemotherapy was started. The fate of S phase cells, labeled in vivo with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immediately before cytostatic treatment, was monitored. BrdU positive cells were identified by fluorescent antibody for up to 28 days.

Different effects of RA in combination with rG-CSF compared with rGM-CSF or IL-3 were not seen when the cells were tested in suspension culture rather than in methylcellulose, a finding that may be interpreted to mean that the interaction between RA and factors affects terminally-dividing blast cells. Three normal bone marrow samples were cultured with RA and growth factors. Colony formation was stimulated by RA in the presence of rGM-CSF or rIL-3 but inhibited by RA with rG-CSF. Thus a differential effect of RA in combination with growth factors occurs in normal hemopoietic cells and persists in some AML populations.","['Tohda, S', 'Minden, M D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Tohda S', 'Minden MD', 'McCulloch EA']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Methylcellulose', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Nov;5(11):951-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakpoints in CML occur within the M-bcr region (5.8 kb) which encompasses exons 12-15 (b1-b4), and the M-bcr can be conveniently divided into five zones by restriction mapping. One of these zones (3) contains exon b3 which can be either present or absent from the hybrid mRNA, even if it is present in the chimaeric gene. We have mapped the breakpoints around BCR exon b3 and related this to the type of RNA splice site expressed, in CML patients at diagnosis. Breakpoints within zone 3 were restriction mapped to one of six sub-zones and the site related to the type of RNA splice site. Two clusters of breakpoints within zone 3 were observed. One cluster was located around exon b3 and often resulted in deletion of exon b3 from the chimaeric gene. The majority of this cluster expressed b2-a2 spliced RNA, usually as a consequence of a deletion removing exon b3. The second cluster occurred within two sub-zones that spanned an Alu sequence, and 90% of this cluster exhibited b3-a2 spliced RNA. Furthermore, a greater number of patients had entered blast crisis if the RNA contained BCR exon b3 (8 of 10 patients), compared to those with b2-a2 spliced RNA (3 of 12 patients). The high degree of heterogeneity in the site of the breakpoint within zone 3 of the M-bcr, combined with the type of BCR-ABL hybrid mRNA expressed, further implicates BCR exon b3 in the pathogenesis of CML.","['Mills, K I', 'Sproul, A M', 'Leibowitz, D', 'Burnett, A K']","['Mills KI', 'Sproul AM', 'Leibowitz D', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Nov;5(11):937-41.,['BCR'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell line has been found to express an alpha beta T-cell receptor (TCR) identifiable with the Mab124-40 anti-clonotypic antibody which is specific for C6VL/1. It has been shown to be genetically and phenotypically distinct from C6VL/1 with a unique phenotype, i.e. CD4-, CD8-, CD3+, TCR-alpha beta. 5C2 has been shown to express high levels of alpha and beta chain mRNA and to utilize the same or similar V alpha and V beta region genes as C6VL/1. Whereas C6VL/1 binds cross-reactively to both RadLV/C6VL and an unrelated isolate RadLV/VL3, 5C2 has binding specificity for only RadLV/C6VL, which induced its proliferation. The anti-clonotypic antibody Mab124-40 specifically and completely inhibits binding of 5C2 to RadLV/C6VL at concentrations as low as 300 ng/ml. The 5C2 cell line can also be stimulated to increased proliferation by RadLV/C6VL. All of these data are consistent with the role of a TCR alpha beta heterodimer in binding and stimulation by RadLV and satisfy one prediction of the receptor-mediated leukemogenesis hypothesis that T-cell clones identifiable by their T-cell receptor clonotype may be targets for transformation by a particular retrovirus.","[""O'Neill, H C""]","[""O'Neill HC""]","['Developmental Haematology Group, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', '*Retroviridae', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Nov;5(11):921-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a small fraction of the cell population undergoes differentiation spontaneously without the addition of any inducing agent. In this paper it is demonstrated that this cell line is heterogeneous with respect to the ability of the cells to differentiate spontaneously: some clones (SD+) have a higher tendency to do so than others (SD-). In semi-solid medium, SD+ cells developed diffused colonies containing mature monocytes and macrophages, whereas SD- cells developed compact colonies of promyelocytes. Based on these morphological differences the various clones were isolated and analysed. Although only a small fraction of the population actually became differentiated at any particular time, practically all the cells in the SD+ clones had the potential to differentiate spontaneously. The clones also differ in their response to differentiation inducers; whereas some agents induced complete differentiation in both types of clones, others (e.g. actinomycin C and cytosine arabinoside) induced only SD+ clones, suggesting that differentiation induced by the latter agents is related to the ability of the cells to differentiate spontaneously. Thus the potential of leukemic cells to undergo spontaneous differentiation may be an important factor when considering differentiation-inducing therapy for leukemic patients.","['Fibach, E', 'Peled, T', 'Fibich, T', 'Rachmilewitz, E A']","['Fibach E', 'Peled T', 'Fibich T', 'Rachmilewitz EA']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Oct;5(10):912-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data suggest that magnetic resonance imaging of the bone marrow is a sensitive method for assessing responses to treatment with pentostatin and alpha-interferon in patients with hairy cell leukemia.","['Bentz, M', 'Dohner, H', 'Guckel, F', 'Semmler, W', 'Kauczor, H U', 'van Kaick, G', 'Ho, A D', 'Hunstein, W']","['Bentz M', 'Dohner H', 'Guckel F', 'Semmler W', 'Kauczor HU', 'van Kaick G', 'Ho AD', 'Hunstein W']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Oct;5(10):905-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are currently treated with prednisone, either as a single treatment or with combination chemotherapy. However, both approaches are associated with high risks in this usually elderly patient population (median age 64 years). While looking for therapeutic alternatives to avoid these problems, the efficacy of low dose recombinant interferon-alpha 2a was examined. Patients received 3 x 10(6) IU daily as a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. Those who achieved a complete remission continued with a maintenance treatment of 3 x 10(6) IU s.c. three times per week. A total of 14 patients received interferon. Twelve were evaluable for response. Six received interferon as primary and six as secondary treatment after the failure of previous treatment with prednisone or chemotherapy. Complete remissions were achieved in four, partial remissions in another four of 12 patients, whereas in the remaining four patients no change or progressive disease was observed. The median remission duration was 3.5 months; the longest durations of complete remissions were 6+ and 7 months. It is concluded that low dose interferon-alpha is an effective and well tolerated drug in T-cell lymphomas of the AILD (LgX) type.

As acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) blasts can express and produce hematopoietic growth factors, the influence of TNF-alpha on the accumulation of mRNAs for c-myc, interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1 beta was evaluated in fresh blasts from 13 patients with AML. Total cellular RNA was extracted from blast cells cultured for 24 hours with or without TNF-alpha (500 U/ml). The c-myc transcript level was decreased by TNF-alpha treatment in 9/13 cases, and increased in only one case. Among the growth factor genes, the GM-CSF gene was more often and consistently influenced by TNF-alpha, increased levels of its transcript being observed in 6/13 cases following treatment with the cytokine; in no case was there a reduction of GM-CSF mRNA. G-CSF and IL-6 transcripts were more heterogeneously influenced, whereas the IL-3 transcript was never detected in our AML samples. The IL-1 beta message was present in 8/13 untreated and in 13/13 TNF-alpha treated samples. Moreover, in untreated cells, GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-6 expression was always associated with IL-beta expression. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha can modulate the levels of growth factor transcripts in AML blasts, and raise questions about the effects of TNF-alpha on leukemic hematopoiesis, considering that TNF-alpha, IL-1 and GM-CSF can synergistically stimulate the growth of AML clonogenic cells.","['Bergamaschi, G', 'Cazzola, M', 'Rosti, V', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Santini, V', 'Ponchio, L', 'Peverali, F A', 'Della Valle, G', 'Rossi Ferrini, P', 'Ascari, E']","['Bergamaschi G', 'Cazzola M', 'Rosti V', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Santini V', 'Ponchio L', 'Peverali FA', 'Della Valle G', 'Rossi Ferrini P', 'Ascari E']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Oct;5(10):886-91.,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF increased the appearance of very high molecular weight DNA fragments detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed these fragments to be as high as 200-400 kilobase pairs. The pattern of HL-60 DNA fragmentation contrasted with that of U937 cells, which exhibited lower molecular weight, nucleosome multiple sized fragments, and greater cytotoxicity in response to TNF. The peak increase of fragments from HL-60 occurred between one and two hours of incubation, with TNF concentrations of 10 U/ml or higher, and was inhibitable by 1 mM Zn2+. Southern blotting of these fragments disclosed enrichment for c-myc related sequences compared with control probes including beta-actin and kappa and lambda light chains. Treatment of DNA with NotI or gamma-irradiation, followed by PFGE, disclosed a class of still higher molecular weight DNA, which decreased following TNF treatment, and which was apparently the precursor of the TNF-induced fragments. TNF thus rapidly increases a class of high molecular weight DNA fragments which are enriched for c-myc related sequences and may arise preferentially from higher molecular weight structures which are detectable following linearization by NotI or gamma-irradiation.

This is manifested both in vivo and in long-term cultures of CML cells as an increased rate of turnover amongst Ph1-positive progenitor cell types whose counterparts in normal individuals are mainly quiescent. To determine whether this deregulated proliferative activity of primitive Ph1-positive cells might be explained by a perturbation in the production of growth factors that regulate the turnover of primitive normal cells, the possibility of either autocrine or paracrine mechanisms of Ph1-positive cell stimulation was investigated. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA extracted from various CML blood cell populations showed no evidence of increased expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) compared with analogous normal peripheral blood cell populations in which transcripts for most of these growth factors are not detectable. A similar analysis of RNA extracted from the adherent layer of 4-week-old long-term cultures established from CML marrow (in which the Ph1-positive cells typically disappear) or from CML blood seeded onto normal marrow adherent layers (in which Ph1-positive cells typically persist) also revealed no difference in growth factor production compared with analogous cultures established with exclusively normal cells. For some of the growth factors studied, the assessment of bioactivity detectable in the medium confirmed the RNA data. There was also no evidence of a decreased production of putative inhibitors of primitive hematopoietic cells, i.e. transforming growth factor-beta and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha by CML versus normal cells or cultures. These results do not support the existence of BCR-ABL induced autocrine or paracrine mechanisms in CML and suggest that constitutive activation of events normally dependent on growth factor receptor stimulation is more likely to underlie the lack of proliferation control exhibited by primitive Ph1-positive cells.","['Otsuka, T', 'Eaves, C J', 'Humphries, R K', 'Hogge, D E', 'Eaves, A C']","['Otsuka T', 'Eaves CJ', 'Humphries RK', 'Hogge DE', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Oct;5(10):861-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequential immunoprecipitation of the protein from human umbilical vein endothelial cells with 1G2 and the endoglin-specific monoclonal antibody 44G4 indicated that both antibodies react with the same molecule, a homodimer of molecular mass 180,000. This protein was first identified on acute lymphoblastic leukemia and was shown to be primarily associated with endothelial cells. In addition, 1G2 and 44G4 identified the same subpopulation of human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC), as established by two colour immunofluorescence analysis. By cell sorting and colony assays it could be demonstrated that endoglin is not expressed on hemopoietic precursor cells (CFU-G, CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, BFU-E). May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining of sorted BMMNC revealed that 1G2 recognized immature proerythroblasts and double-fluorescence analysis showed that endoglin is present on a subset of glycophorin A-positive BMMNC. 1G2 was not reactive on bone marrow B-cells (CD19, CD20), T-cells (CD3, CD7), natural killer cells (CD56), myeloid cells (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33), and on CD34-positive cells. Endoglin contains an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence, a feature generally associated with extracellular matrix proteins which interact with integrins.

The data showed that K562 cells adhered much more frequently to fibroblasts than to other cell types. In the case of some marrow-derived stromal cell layers grown in human group AB serum, the firmly adherent K562 cells showed morphological evidence of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation and, especially in the presence of haemin, sometimes developed into erythrocyte-like cells. The maturing cells were weakly or moderately benzidine-positive. By contrast, K562 cells which adhered to monolayers of fibroblasts, endothelial cells or macrophages showed little or no maturation and were either benzidine-negative or only very weakly positive. In experiments employing monolayers made up by mixing skin fibroblasts and endothelial cells or skin fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages, some adherent K562 cells developed into cells resembling early and late polychromatic normoblasts and erythrocytes. The maturing cells were moderately or strongly benzidine-positive. Maturation was most marked in K562 cells adherent to regions of the monolayer containing all three of the stromal cell types.

The screening was performed using an indirect assay in which the cells were treated firstly with the test antibody and then with a Fab' immunotoxin directed against mouse immunoglobulin. Only two antibodies, MEM75 and 120-2A3, both directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) were predicted to form immunotoxins that would inhibit protein synthesis by the cells by 50% at a concentration (IC50) of 10(-8) M or less. This prediction was subsequently confirmed using several of the antibodies directly conjugated to ricin A-chain. By contrast, the same immunotoxins were highly toxic to non-myeloid cells which shared the target antigens. A comparison was made between the rates of endocytosis and degradation by HL60 cells of an anti-TfR immunotoxin 120-2A3.dgA, that was effective at killing myeloid cells, and a CD33 immunotoxin, p67-7.dgA, that bound to myeloid cells but did not kill them. The difference in potency of the two immunotoxins on HL60 cells was not due to deficient uptake of p67-7.dgA but was probably due to the more rapid intracellular degradation of p67-7.dgA. Fast and effective degradation in lysosomes, if a general finding, could explain the poor susceptibility of myeloid cells to ricin A-chain immunotoxins.","['Engert, A', 'Brown, A', 'Thorpe, P']","['Engert A', 'Brown A', 'Thorpe P']","['Drug Targeting Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', '*Immunotoxins/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Ricin/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90115-a [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(11):1079-86. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90115-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus we subdivided patients with bcr rearrangements into those with genomic breaks at either 5' or 3' of the Bam HI site, just upstream of exon 3. Nine patients had 5' breakpoints and 13 patients had 3' breakpoints. The platelet counts of 3' patients were significantly higher than those of 5' patients (1395 vs 274 x 10(9)/l; p less than 0.03).

The consequence of these changes lead to the formation of intracellular pools of uridine. To examine the possible role of accumulated uridine in the commitment of HL-60 leukemia cells to undergo maturation, the effects of uridine on the growth and differentiation of HL-60 cells were monitored. Uridine at millimolar levels caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of cellular growth, resulting in the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle, phenomena that preceded the formation of differentiated cells. These effects of uridine were reduced by 10 microM NBMPR, an inhibitor of the facilitated transport of nucleosides. The effects of 24 mM uridine on growth and differentiation of HL-60 cells were also prevented by 5 mM inosine, and partially prevented by either 2 mM hypoxanthine or 20 microM adenosine. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with 24 mM uridine for 6 days, followed by a 2 h exposure to TPA, resulted in the rapid attachment of cells to the tissue culture dish, and the extension of long processes. Although the concentrations of uridine required for the above effects are greater than those achieved during differentiation, these observations suggest that uridine may play a role in regulating the maturation process.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Lee, C W', 'Handschumacher, R E', 'Nigam, A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Lee CW', 'Handschumacher RE', 'Nigam A', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Ribonucleotides)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Phenotype', 'Ribonucleotides/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Uridine/*pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90111-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(11):1051-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90111-6.,,,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45303/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumor activity of NKT-01 was shown to be strongly time-dependent; higher efficacy was obtained with prolongation of treatment period and with increasing the number of injections. The dosing interval seemed not to be a dominant factor regarding the activity of NKT-01. The strong dependency on treatment period was also observed in continuous infusion schedules by using Alzet 2001 osmotic minipump. The degree of dependency on infusion period was estimated to be 3- to 4-fold stronger than that on the infused dose by logarithmical plotting of the infusion periods and infused daily doses required to produce 130% of T/C(%). The effective dose range by the continuous infusion was slightly narrower than that by the repeated bolus injections, although slightly higher maximal activity was obtained at the optimal dose. Hyperacute pharmacological toxicity caused by bolus injection of high dose (51.2 mg/kg) of NKT-01 did not occur by continuous infusion method even at much higher dose (409.6 mg/kg/day). Cumulative gastrointestinal toxicity was observed by prolonged continuous infusion as well as repetitive treatment schedule. From these results on antitumor activity and toxicity by various treatment schedules, recommendable clinical modality for NKT-01 seems to be the short-time infusion on every or every other day continuing for a few weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Nishikawa, K', 'Shibasaki, C', 'Takahashi, K', 'Takeuchi, T']","['Nishikawa K', 'Shibasaki C', 'Takahashi K', 'Takeuchi T']","['Research Laboratories, Pharmaceuticals Group, Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanidines)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Guanidines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1991 Sep;44(9):917-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, our objective was to test the model's ability to mimic two strategies for reversal of drug resistance. We present data from one in vitro cell proliferation assay with drug-resistant LS174T human colon carcinoma variants and one in vivo assay of survival after treatment of female (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice inoculated with doxorubicin-resistant P388/ADR leukemia cells. The in vitro assay examined the effects of inhibiting the biosynthesis of glutathione in cells resistant to alkylating agents or cisplatin. The in vivo assay compared the effects on cell survival of low-level continuous infusion versus high-intensity bolus dosing, with or without coadministration of the drug efflux pump blocker verapamil. Results in vitro and in vivo were comparable for qualitative accuracy and predictability to results with the model. Both the in vitro study and the model showed that, for resistant cells with high levels of glutathione, short-term cell survival was dose dependent and that even high doses of drug did not eliminate all of these cells. Addition of an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis did, however, augment elimination of the resistant cells. Resistant cells with low levels of glutathione could be eliminated with high drug doses or coadministration of drug and a glutathione synthesis inhibitor. In vivo, coadministration of doxorubicin with verapamil increased animal survival when either continuous infusion or bolus dosing regimens were used. The effectiveness of the blocker is crucial; when a partially (50%) effective blocker is used, continuous infusion achieves better elimination of resistant cells, but a completely (100%) effective blocker is efficacious in both dosing scenarios. Careful interpretation of these findings is necessary because the pharmacokinetics of drug in the small populations of cells in the model are not easily extrapolated to those in large tumors. This model may be useful in determining resistance mechanisms, their levels of effectiveness, and concentrations of compounds required at target sites to overcome them.","['Slate, D', 'Michelson, S']","['Slate D', 'Michelson S']","['Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology, Syntex Research, Palo Alto, Calif 94303.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Female', 'Glutathione/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Models, Theoretical']",1991/11/06 00:00,1991/11/06 00:01,['1991/11/06 00:00'],"['1991/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/83.21.1574 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1991 Nov 6;83(21):1574-80. doi: 10.1093/jnci/83.21.1574.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a case of severe thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency (activity less than 1 U/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes) in a young girl with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The level of 6-thioguanine nucleotide in the patient's erythrocytes was seven times the population median value, and she had intolerable hematologic toxic effects during postremission therapy with a standard dosage of mercaptopurine (75 mg/m2 per day). Subsequent therapy with 6% of this dosage (10 mg/m2 three times weekly) yielded erythrocytic 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations consistently above the population median but not associated with prohibitively toxic effects. This case demonstrates that thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency does not absolutely contraindicate mercaptopurine therapy, and it also provides insight into the mechanism of excessive toxic effects of mercaptopurine sometimes observed in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Evans, W E', 'Horner, M', 'Chu, Y Q', 'Kalwinsky, D', 'Roberts, W M']","['Evans WE', 'Horner M', 'Chu YQ', 'Kalwinsky D', 'Roberts WM']","[""Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Section, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (Purine Nucleotides)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,,"['Child', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/blood/complications', 'Methyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Purine Nucleotides/blood', 'Thioguanine/analogs & derivatives/blood']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)83063-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)83063-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1991 Dec;119(6):985-9. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)83063-x.,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 04-36401/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Light-density cells isolated from the grafts of 26 patients with acute leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma were treated with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC; 30 to 60 micrograms/mL), vincristine (Vcr; 1.5 to 3.0 micrograms/mL), and methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MP; 5 mg/mL). All patients received marrow-lethal induction therapy followed by infusion of the treated grafts. Three patients died of transplant-related complications before achieving peripheral blood recovery of greater than 0.5 x 10(9) granulocytes per liter. All other patients achieved this parameter of engraftment at a median of 35 days after marrow infusion. The median time to last platelet transfusion was 45 days. These durations of aplasia were similar to those experienced by other patients receiving density-gradient separated grafts treated with 60 micrograms/mL of 4-HC as a single agent. No patient required infusion of untreated reserve marrow because of engraftment failure. The colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) content of the grafts after purging predicted these parameters of engraftment. Colony-forming unit-leukemia (CFU-L) cultured from the grafts of 12 of the patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were considerably more sensitive to the combination regimen than to 4-HC alone; the sensitivity of CFU-GM from these patients did not differ between the two regimens. The results of this trial indicate the feasibility of treating autologous bone marrow grafts with high concentrations of pharmacologics in combination. The use of combinations may increase the efficacy of ex vivo purging without increasing the toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells.","['Rowley, S D', 'Miller, C B', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Davis, J M', 'Santos, G W', 'Jones, R J']","['Rowley SD', 'Miller CB', 'Piantadosi S', 'Davis JM', 'Santos GW', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vincristine']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.12.2210 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Dec;9(12):2210-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.12.2210.,,,['CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reexamined the relationship between translocations and prognosis in 146 children with ALL who received risk-based therapy such that high-risk patients were treated with intensive drug schedules. In univariate analysis, multiple factors were associated with a relatively poor event-free survival (EFS) including age less than 2 years or greater than 10 years (combined group), WBC count greater than 10 x 10(9)/L, French-American-British (FAB) morphologic classification L2, absence of common ALL antigen (CALLA, CD10) expression, absence of hyperdiploidy with a chromosome number of 50 to 60, and presence of the specific translocations t(4; 11)(q21;q23) or t(9;22)(q34;q11) (combined group). However, there was no disadvantage with respect to EFS in patients with translocations compared with those who lacked translocations (73% at 4 years in both groups). Furthermore, when patients with specific cytogenetic abnormalities for which the prognostic significance has been well established (hyperdiploid 50 to 60, t(4;11), and t(9;22] were removed from the analysis, the remaining group with other translocations had a better EFS than the remaining group lacking translocations, although this was not statistically significant (81% v 65% at 4 years, P = .24). In a multivariate analysis, a model including WBC count and FAB classification was the strongest predictor of EFS. The presence or absence of translocations was not an independent predictor of EFS and did not contribute to the ability of any model to predict EFS. In conclusion, when effective intensive therapy is used to treat childhood ALL with high-risk clinical features, categorization of patients on the basis of chromosomal translocations without attention to the specific abnormality is not useful as a prognostic factor.","['Rubin, C M', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Mick, R', 'Bitter, M A', 'Nachman, J', 'Rudinsky, R', 'Appel, H J', 'Morgan, E', 'Suarez, C R', 'Schumacher, H R']","['Rubin CM', 'Le Beau MM', 'Mick R', 'Bitter MA', 'Nachman J', 'Rudinsky R', 'Appel HJ', 'Morgan E', 'Suarez CR', 'Schumacher HR', 'et al.']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Wyler Children's Hospital, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.12.2183 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Dec;9(12):2183-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.12.2183.,,,"['CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In line with the immunophenotype, DNA analysis revealed a rearranged configuration of both the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (beta, gamma, and delta) genes. In spite of this dual B/T phenotype and genotype, the negativity of CyCD3 favors the suggestion that the target of the neoplastic event is an early B cell, with a cross lineage involvement of the putative common recombinase. However, taking into account that a normal counterpart of a biphenotypic B/T ALL has been recognized, it could be hypothesized that the leukemic transformation may have involved an oligopotent B/T lymphoid precursor. This case confirms the lineage heterogeneity of CML-BC and suggests that DNA analyses coupled to extensive immunophenotyping may allow further insight for a more precise recognition of both normal and leukemic ontogenesis.","['Morabito, F', 'Callea, V', 'Oliva, B', 'di Celle, P F', 'Carbone, A', 'Nobile, F', 'Foa, R']","['Morabito F', 'Callea V', 'Oliva B', 'di Celle PF', 'Carbone A', 'Nobile F', 'Foa R']","['Divisione di Ematologia Ospedali Ospedali Riuniti Reggio Calabria, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*pathology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1991;5(3):119-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, the p53 gene was chosen for study, since alteration of the gene has been found in a wide variety of human cancers. Structures and expression of the p53 gene in ATL cells were investigated by Southern and Northern blot analyses and a polymerase-chain-reaction single-strand conformation-polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Either subtle alterations of the p53 gene or the absence of detectable level of p53 mRNA were found in 2 of 3 acute ATL cell lines and 2 of 12 acute ATL fresh samples. In contrast, no mutation was detected in 4 cases with less aggressive types of ATL (3 chronic and 1 smoldering ATL cases). Mutations found in acute ATL cells occurred in regions highly conserved in evolution and all the cells carrying p53 mutation showed loss of the other p53 allele.

In addition, pre-B ALL expressed the neo-lacto series GSL, paragloboside, which was not significantly seen at later stages of maturation. As a group, leukemias expressed about 10 times higher ratios of simple GSL to Globo-series GSL as compared to lymphomas, regardless of stage of differentiation. Significant amounts of GSL of other series were not found except in one CLL which contained asialo-GM2. GSL phenotype in these cells was not grossly affected by cell genotype since pre-B ALL containing Philadelphia chromosome t(9q;22q) translocations were similar to other ALL; and DHL with t(8q;14q) translocations had GSL patterns similar to other DHL samples and dissimilar to GSL patterns found in Burkitt's lymphomas with t(8q;14q).

The objective of the current studies was to investigate the potential contribution of epithelial cells to the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the tissue. We have established pure cultures of human upper airway epithelial cells from normal and inflamed nasal polyps and allergic rhinitis tissue and examined the ability of conditioned medium from these cells (EpCM) to induce differentiation of human hemopoietic progenitors in vitro. We show that, under appropriate culture conditions, EpCMs, particularly those from cells derived from inflamed tissues, induce histamine-containing cell differentiation of cells of the human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line. These EpCMs also induce the emergence of both eosinophil/basophil and granulocyte/macrophage colonies in methylcellulose cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also show that CMs from epithelial cells derived from inflamed tissues contain greater amounts of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) compared to CMs from normal epithelial cells. Finally, we show that the histamine-containing cell differentiation of HL-60 cells as well as the colony growth induced by EpCM can be fully inhibited by preincubating this CM with a monoclonal neutralizing antibody to human GM-CSF.

I made monoclonal antibodies against it by using spleen cells of the syngeneic rats in whom the Friend virus-associated tumor cells spontaneously regressed. As a result, I was able to obtain a monoclonal antibody, named TF 1, to react specifically to the infection of Friend virus and found out that TF1 antibody reacted to gp 70, a product of the envelope gene of Friend virus, on Friend virus-infected rat tumor cells. And also I found out that B16BL6 cells, which are mouse melanoma cells and are not infected with Friend virus, were positive to TF1 antibody and made it clear that the melanoma antigen which reacted to TF 1 antibody was not gp 70, but a protein of 80-85 KD. Immunizing therefore with gp 70 cross-reacting with the melanoma antigen, I was able to observe that resistance to the transplantability of B16BL6 cells was induced. The result suggests that the melanoma antigen played a role as a tumor rejection antigen.

The level of lipid peroxidation and, consequently, the concentration of its products are inversely related to the rate of cell proliferation and directly related to the level of cell differentiation. In the present paper the effects of HNE on the proliferation and differentiation of the HL-60 human promyelocytic cell line have been investigated. Repeated treatment at 45-min intervals with HNE (1 microM) was performed to maintain the cells in the presence of the aldehyde for 7 1/2 or 9 h. The effect of HNE on cell proliferation and differentiation was compared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells. HNE causes a strong inhibition of cell growth without affecting cell viability. Moreover, HL-60 cells acquire the capability to produce chemiluminescence after soluble (phorbol myristate acetate) or corpuscolate (zymosan) stimulation. The phagocytic ability has also been calculated by counting the number of cells that phagocytize opsonized zymosan. Values were 43 and 55% after 10 or 12 HNE treatments, respectively, and 88% in DMSO-treated cells. Myeloperoxidase activity, 5 days after treatment, decreased by 85% in either HNE- or DMSO-treated cells while acid phosphatase activity increased with respect to untreated cells. Results obtained indicate that HNE at concentrations close to those found in the normal tissues can induce inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation in the HL-60 cell line.","['Barrera, G', 'Di Mauro, C', 'Muraca, R', 'Ferrero, D', 'Cavalli, G', 'Fazio, V M', 'Paradisi, L', 'Dianzani, M U']","['Barrera G', 'Di Mauro C', 'Muraca R', 'Ferrero D', 'Cavalli G', 'Fazio VM', 'Paradisi L', 'Dianzani MU']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Aldehydes)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(91)90416-r [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Dec;197(2):148-52. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90416-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, leukaemic cells, although not readily apparent, persist in most patients since the remissions cannot be sustained without further cytoreductive measures. To eradicate residual disease after induction chemotherapy, various treatment options (particularly allogeneic bone marrow transplantation) have been used. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) can also lead to long-term survival, presumably due to the eradication or control of residual disease, but this occurs in only about 50% of cases transplanted. Relapse in the other patients occurs as a consequence of leukaemic cells surviving the conditioning regimen and/or the infusion of leukaemic cells present in the autografted bone marrow. In attempts to decrease the relapse rates after ABMT, chemical or immunological methods for in vitro purging of the harvested bone marrow cells to remove residual leukaemia have been used: the effectiveness of these procedures is unproven. This chapter describes the biology of long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC). How the biological differences between normal and leukaemic cells in LTBMC can be exploited to encourage the growth of normal haemopoietic cells at the expense of leukaemic cells, and how these cultured cells can be used in ABMT are discussed. The survival of patients after LTBMC/ABMT and the low relapse rate indicate that this is a useful therapeutic approach in the treatment of patients with leukaemia.","['Chang, J', 'Dexter, T M']","['Chang J', 'Dexter TM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Cell Separation', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90012-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1991 Jul;4(3):775-88. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90012-9.,,,,,,,56,,,,,,,,,

For a minority of the remaining group myeloablative chemoradiotherapy supported by allogeneic marrow from an HLA-matched donor can cure the disease. Major efforts are being made to free the potential benefit of this approach from the limitations imposed by the associated immune-biological complications, and limited donor availability. In the last decade the resurgence of autologous transplantation in remission has been a major new source of hope for further progress. Many groups have produced encouraging results, which now that they have substantial follow-up, suggest that this approach is altering the normal pattern of relapse. Almost all the experience, however, while producing consistent results, at least in AML, is anecdotal. The possibility of selection bias, particularly by the time-censoring effect, cannot be excluded, and prospective controlled trials are needed. The data available suggest which investigations could be expected to yield clear results. Other questions, particularly whether or not to purge the marrow, are only practical to investigate in well-defined patient subgroups.

Both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent effectors of GvL exist, and both may play an important role in the elimination of minimal residual disease after BMT. There is evidence that GvL activity may be separable from GvHD either by identifying T cell clones recognizing specific leukaemia antigens or by using immunomodulatory drugs or cytokines to enhance T cell-independent GvL mechanisms which operate without alloreactivity and therefore without concomitant exacerbation of GvHD. These approaches should improve survival after both autologous and allogeneic BMT.","['Brenner, M K', 'Heslop, H E']","['Brenner MK', 'Heslop HE']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90010-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1991 Jul;4(3):727-49. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90010-5.,,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,91,,,,,,,,,

The latter phenomenon suggests that either curative GVL effects may be inducible despite subclinical GVHD or alternatively that effector cells of GVL may recognize different tumour-associated targets different from cell surface determinants of 'normal' alloantigens. Alternatively, effector cells of GVL may be distinguished from effector cells of GVHD. It is tempting to suggest that NK and IL2-aspirated NK cells may play a major role as effector cells of GVL in an MHC non-restricted fashion, different from classical CD8+ cytotoxic cells that certainly play a major role in GVHD and GVL. Once proven, the latter hypothesis may help develop new and safer therapeutic approaches since NK cells and products of the NK cell family are unlikely to play a major role, if any, in GVHD. The feasibility of induction of GVL-like effects by MHC non-restricted effector cells, such as that observed by CMI, most likely through cytokine-activated NK cells, seems promising because such effector mechanisms may be utilized clinically through either adoptive transfer of in vitro-activated lymphocytes or activation of lymphocytes in vivo by administration of cytokines such as IL2 and alpha IFN. Similarly, induction of CCI following ABMT may permit establishment of GVL-like effects with no major risk of GVHD. Our animal models suggest that both approaches may be beneficial and perhaps even combined. From a practical standpoint, activation of antitumour effector cells in vivo is much more feasible, in comparison with the cumbersome and expensive technologies for large-scale in vitro manipulation of IL2-activated 'LAK' cells or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes ('TIL') at dose ranges required for obtaining clinically meaningful responses. No less important is the fact that more potent immunotherapy may be inducible by cytokine combinations (such as IL2 and alpha IFN). We are currently investigating additional cytokine combinations in order to attempt to optimize antitumour effects inducible by allogeneic and syngeneic lymphocytes since it appears logical that amplifying in vivo antitumour responses by multiple cytokine combinations may yield better antitumour effects.","['Slavin, S', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Vourka-Karussis, U', 'Nagler, A', 'Or, R', 'Naparstek, E', 'Weiss, L']","['Slavin S', 'Ackerstein A', 'Vourka-Karussis U', 'Nagler A', 'Or R', 'Naparstek E', 'Weiss L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', '*Remission Induction']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90009-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1991 Jul;4(3):715-25. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90009-9.,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,

Chemoincurability in chronic myeloid leukaemia and in myelodysplastic syndrome is the norm and is the result of tumour defect arising within the marrow stem cell compartment. We propose that this is indeed the state of affairs in the majority of adult acute leukaemias and such tumours derived from stem cells are chemoincurable. The proportion of acute leukaemias which belong to this category can only be cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation though conventional chemotherapy and autotransplant may result in prolonged periods of remission and a return to a preleukaemic state in some patients. A proportion of the acute leukaemias occurring predominantly in children are presently curable by chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that these chemocurable leukaemias derive from the compartment of haemopoietic progenitors already irreversibly committed to a single lineage. Some recent studies using markers of the leukaemic clone to determine the origin of in vitro myeloid colony forming cells support this concept. Intrinsic and/or acquired genetic chemoresistance represents a supplementary restriction to the chemocurability of acute leukaemias. New methods of detecting MRL are sensitive enough to detect up to one leukaemic cell in 10(6) bone marrow mononuclear cells. However, it is possible that even such sensitive techniques will not be sufficient to determine whether patients in complete remission continue to harbour leukaemic cells in the stem cell compartment when the marker of interest might not be expressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jasmin, C', 'Charpentier, A', 'Marion, S', 'Proctor, S J']","['Jasmin C', 'Charpentier A', 'Marion S', 'Proctor SJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', '*Remission Induction']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90003-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1991 Jul;4(3):599-607. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90003-8.,,,,,,,36,,,,,,,,,

The available evidence suggests that the normal-appearing cells during relapse may not all be remnants of normal haemopoiesis but may at least in part be derived from leukaemic cells. Although a differentiation defect is a major characteristic of acute leukaemia, it seems as if this defect is not absolute: some cells may succeed in differentiating more or less normally in spite of their descent from a leukaemic stem cell. Acute leukaemia is usually considered to be a primary white cell disorder which indirectly affects the other haemopoietic cell lines. It appears more likely, however, that acute leukaemia, at least the myeloid type, is a disorder of a stem cell common to granulocytopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and probably thrombocytopoiesis. Most descendants from the diseased stem cell fail to differentiate and remain at the blast cell level where they proliferate for some time; however, at a certain point proliferation ceases and the cells ultimately die. Another fraction of the progeny of the leukaemic stem cells may differentiate to some extent and may give rise to functionally useful cells. This is analogous to chronic myeloid leukaemia. The mechanism by which useful haemopoiesis apparently is suppressed in the presence of leukaemic blast cells has remained enigmatic so far. Previously suggested explanations which all assume some kind of cell-cell interaction by which normal haemopoietic cells succumb have neither been proved nor disproved. In this chapter, a new hypothesis is presented. It is assumed that some normal haemopoietic stem cells enter a dormant state at various distances in lineage from the fertilized ovum ('sleepers'). Another fraction of haemopoietic stem cells ('feeders') are actively proliferating and serve to feed the differentiating haemopoietic cell lines and to maintain the 'feeder' pool. When the 'feeder' pool is exhausted, a 'sleeper' cell is activated and sets up a new 'feeder' clone. Otherwise, 'sleepers' are protected against acting as 'feeders' in order to keep 'sleeper' divisions at a minimum and thus preserve their genetic information as intact as possible. It is suggested that the leukaemic event initially takes place in one or a few 'sleepers'. If the leukaemic 'sleeper' never succeeds in setting up a 'feeder' clone, clinical leukaemia will not develop. Clinical leukaemia will result if a leukaemic 'sleeper' establishes a leukaemic 'feeder' pool.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Killmann, S A']",['Killmann SA'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Remission Induction']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90002-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1991 Jul;4(3):577-98. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(09)90002-6.,,,,,,,114,,,,,,,,,

Although large numbers of compounds from diverse sources were evaluated for many years in the P388 mouse leukemia model, only a few clinically useful drugs have been identified by this in vivo screening method. Thus, there is intense interest in the development of more effective in vitro screening models for new anticancer drugs. In the present paper we have compared the discriminating power for fresh human tumors from patients, human tumor cell lines developed from 11 patients and murine P388 leukemia in tumor colony forming assays as indicators of cytotoxicity for a series of anthracene antitumor agents. Two of a series of 21 novel bisantrene analogs, R6 (N,N1-bis[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-9,10-anthracene-bis(methylamine)) and R26 (N,N1-bis(1-ethyl-3-piperidinyl)-9,10-anthracene-bis(methylamine] produced significant cytotoxicity against the 11 human tumor cell lines and were therefore selected for additional in vitro and in vivo studies. R26 was specifically selected for further testing since it had similar in vitro potency as mitoxantrone, but showed no cross-resistance against mitoxantrone-resistant WiDr colon or doxorubicin-resistant 8226 myeloma cell lines. In contrast to the cell line data, only of the 22 fresh human tumors showed significant in vitro sensitivity (i.e. less than 50% survival of tumor colony forming units) to either R6 or R26 tested at high concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Alberts, D S', 'Dorr, R T', 'Wunz, T P', 'Remers, W A', 'Einspahr, J', 'Liu, R', 'Salmon, S E']","['Alberts DS', 'Dorr RT', 'Wunz TP', 'Remers WA', 'Einspahr J', 'Liu R', 'Salmon SE']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199102000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1991 Feb;2(1):69-77. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199102000-00010.,,,"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were interested in the comparison of the antineoplastic activity of this new antimetabolite with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) against HL-60 myeloid, RPMI-8392 B-lymphoid and Molt-3 T-lymphoid leukemic cell lines. Our in vitro experiments showed that dFdC was a more potent cytostatic drug than ARA-C against all the leukemic lines with IC50 ranging from 3 to 10 nM for dFdC and from 26 to 52 nM for ARA-C for a 48 h exposure. The cytotoxicity of both drugs was evaluated by clonogenic assay and dFdC was found to be 100 times more potent than ARA-C against all the leukemic cell lines for both a 2 h and a 24 h exposure. The recovery of DNA synthesis after drug removal was much slower for dFdC than for ARA-C. However, in contrast to cytostatic and cytotoxicity results ARA-C was a more potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis than dFdC for all the leukemic cell lines for short exposure. Uptake and elimination of the drugs showed that dFdC accumulated to a higher degree in the leukemic cells than ARA-C and that elimination of this difluoro analog was slower than that of ARA-C. These results indicate that dFdC has more potent in vitro antileukemic activity than ARA-C.","['Bouffard, D Y', 'Momparler, L F', 'Momparler, R L']","['Bouffard DY', 'Momparler LF', 'Momparler RL']","['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199102000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1991 Feb;2(1):49-55. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199102000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we report on the effects of the administration of Escherichia coli-produced, human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in 15 adult patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) resistant to first-line treatment or in relapse. GM-CSF was given at a dose of 5-10 micrograms/kg/day as a 6-h i.v. infusion, prior to chemotherapy (CHT) (for 7 days) and after CHT (until evidence of failure or of remission). In the pre-CHT period there was a clear trend towards an increase of circulating neutrophils (PMN) and/or blast cell count (median 0.3 vs. 1.0 x 10(9)/l for PMN, and 0.5 vs. 2.3 for blast cells). After chemotherapy, in the patients who achieved complete remission (CR), the median time to a PMN count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l and greater than 1 x 10(9)/l was 16 days (range 13-27) and 19 days (range 13-42) respectively. The outcome of treatment was CR for 8/15 (53%), death during induction for 3/15 (20%), and failure for 4/15 (27%). All failures occurred in patients with an increase of blast cell count during pre-CHT GM-CSF administration. Toxicity and side effects were minor, apart from an acute respiratory syndrome that developed twice in the same patient, at doses of 10 and 3 micrograms/kg/day. These data suggest that investigation of GM-CSF in the treatment of ANLL is worth pursuing, with special attention to GM-CSF effects prior to chemotherapy.","['Visani, G', 'Damiani, D', 'Cenacchi, A', 'Russo, D', 'Revignas, G', 'Gamberi, B', 'Fanin, R', 'Fogli, M', 'Baccarani, M', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Damiani D', 'Cenacchi A', 'Russo D', 'Revignas G', 'Gamberi B', 'Fanin R', 'Fogli M', 'Baccarani M', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia L. e A.

We followed the serum level of the protein for 18 months. Patients with infectious complications, those receiving cytostatic treatment, and those in the preterminal period had further reduced serum alpha 2-HS glycoprotein levels. The reduction of serum alpha 2-HS glycoprotein concentration was primarily due to decreased production caused by infiltration of the liver, a hepatotoxic effect of cytostatic treatment, and, to a lesser degree, to increased consumption. We found statistically significant negative correlations between serum alpha 2-HS glycoprotein concentration and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, and IgG and IgM concentrations.

The BCR/ABL gene is transcribed from the promoter of the normal BCR gene, but little is known about the regulation of its expression. In this study, we asked whether there are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (DBP) that bind to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr, or Mbcr) within the BCR gene. Sequence-specific DBP located within the Mbcr could have a transcription-regulating effect, and they could participate in the recombination that generates BCR/ABL.

The VDJ junctional fragment of the Ig heavy chain rearranged gene was amplified at diagnosis. After length reduction by restriction digestion, the amplified fragment was recovered by chromatography, labelled using a specific hexamer as a primer and directly used as a clonospecific probe. The sensitivity of the PCR ranged from 1:10(4) to 1:10(5) cells, depending on the patient's rearrangement. Residual disease (MRD) was detected in most of the patients achieving a complete remission after induction therapy, regardless of the long-term outcome of treatment. However, in patients remaining in complete remission, the level of MRD showed a tendency to decrease and ultimately become undetectable for variable periods of time, while in patients eventually relapsing there was a trend for MRD to persist at stable levels and even to increase before relapse was clinically evident.

Trial comparing busulphan with busulphan and thioguanine.,185-92,"Portal hypertension with varices developed in 18/675 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in a randomized trial comparing busulphan with busulphan and thioguanine. All 18 had received the drug combination and none busulphan alone (P less than 0.0001). Ascites was also seen significantly more often in the combination arm (P less than 0.05). These results strongly suggest that the addition of thioguanine was responsible for the development of portal hypertension. The histological features were predominantly those of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension--either idiopathic portal hypertension with minimal morphological abnormalities, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or in two cases leukaemic infiltration only was noted. Cirrhosis was present in 3/16 cases studied. Both treatment groups developed abnormal liver function tests during the chronic phase, but particularly with progression of the disease. During chronic phase abnormalities were significantly more frequent in those receiving busulphan and thioguanine-alkaline phosphatase (P less than 0.02), transaminases (P less than 0.04), bilirubin (P less than 0.05), multiple abnormalities (P less than 0.01). The development of portal hypertension was often associated with abnormalities of these tests; however, lack of specificity precludes their use as a predictor of subsequent clinical problems. Thioguanine confers no survival advantage in this disease. In view of its hepatotoxicity it should not be used routinely for maintenance of control in chronic phase CML.","['Shepherd, P C', 'Fooks, J', 'Gray, R', 'Allan, N C']","['Shepherd PC', 'Fooks J', 'Gray R', 'Allan NC']","['Western General Hospital, Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.6.1.- (Transaminases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Ascites/chemically induced', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Esophageal and Gastric Varices/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Portal/*chemically induced', 'Jaundice/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/*adverse effects', 'Transaminases/blood']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04520.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Oct;79(2):185-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04520.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After several decades of relative inactivity, important progress has been made in our understanding of the biology and immunology of this disorder. In addition, exciting therapeutic results have been achieved with several new, unique, and effective therapies. The most interesting chemotherapeutic agent is fludarabine, a purine analogue which achieves complete remission in 13% of relapsed or refractory patients and in greater than 30% of previously untreated patients; the overall response rates of 60% and 75%, respectively, are superior to reports with other single agents or combination regimens. Related drugs with promising activity are 2'-deoxycoformycin, and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Preliminary studies are evaluating allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation as potentially curative therapy. Biological approaches exploiting new insights into the immunology of CLL include the use of lymphoid growth factors. Interpretation of results of CLL studies has suffered from variability in eligibility and response criteria, especially definitions of complete remission. Recently published standardized guidelines for CLL clinical trials will facilitate comparisons among therapies and help identify those which are most promising.

Determination of the excretion of protein, albumin, alpha-1-microglobulin immunoglobulin G (Ig G), 3. serum creatinine. The investigations were done every 2 weeks and took 70 weeks. We found an increase in the excretion of all 4 enzymes which remained stable during the whole observation period, protein excretion was pathological in about 20% of all pts and reached values of up to 9.07 g/L alpha-1-microglobulin was excreted in pathological amounts in about 20% of all pts during the whole observation period, albumin was found in pathological quantities in about 15% of all pts and Ig G was pathologically increased in the urine in about 10% of the pts.

In the study group there were fewer HLA (A, B and DR) mismatches (P less than 0.05) and greater pretransplant haematocrit (P less than 0.01) than in the control group. Other clinical factors--previous allografts, panel reactive cytotoxic antibodies, duration and type of dialysis, transplant function, pre- and post-transplant blood pressure, number of rejection episodes, cyclosporin concentration and dose, smoking habits and use of diuretics--did not differ significantly between the two groups. In our experience, erythrocytosis in cyclosporin-treated patients is a relatively common phenomenon and does not, in general, resolve spontaneously. It is unrelated to transplant function or rejection episodes but affects patients with well-matched kidneys and elevated pretransplant haematocrit values.","['Innes, A', 'Pal, C R', 'Dennis, M J', 'Ryan, J J', 'Morgan, A G', 'Burden, R P']","['Innes A', 'Pal CR', 'Dennis MJ', 'Ryan JJ', 'Morgan AG', 'Burden RP']","['Department of Renal Medicine, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia/*etiology', '*Postoperative Complications']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ndt/6.8.588 [doi]'],ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1991;6(8):588-91. doi: 10.1093/ndt/6.8.588.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mycetoma, which usually develops following trauma, is the most common infection caused by Acremonium spp. Other sites of infection include the eye (generally following abrogation of ocular defenses), colonizing disease of the lung and gastrointestinal tract, as well as locally invasive infections such as osteomyelitis, sinusitis, arthritis, and peritonitis. Pneumonia and disseminated infections including meningitis, endocarditis, and cerebritis rarely have been reported. Optimal treatment of acremonium infections is not well defined both because infections due to these organisms are rare, and because many reports antedate effective antifungal therapy. In addition, susceptibility testing of filamentous fungi is poorly standardized, and in vitro sensitivity may not correlate with clinical response. Based on anecdotal reports, treatment of most invasive acremonium infections requires a combination of surgical intervention, when possible, and a regimen of amphotericin B. Some azoles also display inhibitory activity. Until more details are available regarding susceptibility of these organisms to antifungal agents, amphotericin B is recommended as initial therapy with the addition of either ketoconazole or fluconazole in infections of a life-threatening nature.","['Fincher, R M', 'Fisher, J F', 'Lovell, R D', 'Newman, C L', 'Espinel-Ingroff, A', 'Shadomy, H J']","['Fincher RM', 'Fisher JF', 'Lovell RD', 'Newman CL', 'Espinel-Ingroff A', 'Shadomy HJ']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia Hospital and Clinics, Augusta.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,,"['*Acremonium/growth & development', 'Ecology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycology', 'Mycoses/classification/complications/*microbiology', 'Terminology as Topic']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005792-199111000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1991 Nov;70(6):398-409. doi: 10.1097/00005792-199111000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The B-ring trifluoroacetamido-substituted analogues exhibit moderate enhancement of potency compared to the nonfluorinated analogues for tubulin assembly inhibition and cytotoxicity toward two wild type cell lines. The C-ring substituted fluoroethylamides have reduced relative potencies in the same systems due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the fluoro derivatives. The fluoro colchicinoids are much more cytotoxic toward drug-resistant cell lines than to the wild type cell lines. Their enhanced potency is probably due to an effect of the fluoro moiety on functions specific to resistant cells and/or their higher hydrophobicity that may result in higher intracellular drug content.

Zebularine provides increase in life span (ILS) values of ca. 70% against intraperitoneal (ip) murine B16 melanoma and 50% against P388 leukemia. This compound is active when administered either ip or orally against ip or subcutaneously implanted L1210 leukemia, producing ILS values of about 100% at an optimum dose of 400 mg/kg. 1b is also active (60% ILS) against ara-C-resistant L1210. The analogous unsubstituted purine riboside nebularine (2) has modest activity against P388 leukemia (60% ILS). While 2'-ara-fluorozebularine (7b) is only marginally active (40% ILS) at high doses against L1210 leukemia, 5-fluoro analogue 6b is more active than zebularine and is ca. 100 times more potent. Although the activity of 6b is about the same as that of 1b against P388 leukemia, greater potency also is realized in this model. Zebularine is a strong inhibitor of cytidine deaminase, but in contrast to tetrahydrouridine, 1b is acid-stable. In an attempt to use this property to advantage in oral administration, 1b and ara-C have been orally coadministered to mice with ip L1210 leukemia. When zebularine is given in divided doses, up to a 2-fold increase in activity is realized, relative to treatment with the same dose of ara-C alone.","['Driscoll, J S', 'Marquez, V E', 'Plowman, J', 'Liu, P S', 'Kelley, J A', 'Barchi, J J Jr']","['Driscoll JS', 'Marquez VE', 'Plowman J', 'Liu PS', 'Kelley JA', 'Barchi JJ Jr']","['Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, DTP, DCT, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', ""136675-88-2 (2'-arafluorozebularine)"", '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '64967-16-4 (5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1991/11/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/11/11 19:15'],"['1991/11/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/11/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00115a017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 Nov;34(11):3280-4. doi: 10.1021/jm00115a017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The selectivity of kansuiphorin A, which inhibits the growth of particular cell types within the disease-oriented human cancer cell line panels, is discussed.","['Wu, T S', 'Lin, Y M', 'Haruna, M', 'Pan, D J', 'Shingu, T', 'Chen, Y P', 'Hsu, H Y', 'Nakano, T', 'Lee, K H']","['Wu TS', 'Lin YM', 'Haruna M', 'Pan DJ', 'Shingu T', 'Chen YP', 'Hsu HY', 'Nakano T', 'Lee KH']","['Natural Products Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '135883-24-8 (kansuiphorin A)', '135928-39-1 (kansuiphorin B)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/np50075a011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 1991 May-Jun;54(3):823-9. doi: 10.1021/np50075a011.,,,['CA 17625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe the effects of methylprednisolone (MP) and etoposide (VP16) alone or in combination on 5 tumor cell lines (HL-60, a promyelocytic cell line; Molt-4, a T cell leukemia; Daudi, a Burkitt's lymphoma and R10/8226 and R40/8226, doxorubicin-resistant myeloma cell lines). The tumor cell kill efficiency of the drugs was assayed using the limiting dilution assay. We determined the toxic effect on progenitor cells by assaying granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU). With a combination of MP at 10(-3) M and VP16 at 75 microM, we observed the following log reduction in tumor cell clones: HL-60, 4.695 +/- 0.001; Molt-4, 3.626 +/- 0.036; Daudi, 5.633 +/- 0.001; R10/8226, 3.052 +/- 0.544; R40/8226, 3.126 +/- 0.080. CFU recovery was 24% +/- 5%. Mixing tumor cell lines with a 20-fold excess of normal irradiated BM cells did not eliminate the inhibitory effect of the drug combination. We propose that MP and VP16 used in concert produce effective purging of malignant hematopoietic cells from BM while sparing normal progenitors needed for engraftment.","['Miller, G', 'Brashear, T', 'Stone, M', 'Fay, J']","['Miller G', 'Brashear T', 'Stone M', 'Fay J']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor University Medical Center, Charles A.

Assessment of nucleated cells and clonogenic progenitors in the adherent and nonadherent fractions of LTC revealed active hemopoiesis for greater than 5 wks in 4 of 8 cultures of AML blood, and 4 of 7 of AML marrow. The morphology and kinetics of nucleated cells and progenitors with putative normal (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units or CFU-gm), and abnormal (blast) phenotype in LTC from AML blood were similar to those from AML marrow, and adherent cells positive for collagen I and III and vimentin were found in both types of LTC. Growth of CFU-gm colonies ceased by wk 5-8 in AML cultures, significantly earlier than in LTC of normal marrow cells (survival of greater than 10 wks), which may indicate derivation of the CFU-gm from a transformed clone or deficiency of stromal function in the leukemic state. In most AML blood and AML marrow LTCs, growth of abnormal (blast) colonies continued until wk 4-6. This study demonstrates certain similarities of morphology and function between LTC of AML blood and AML marrow cells.

Reduction of the arrest and retention of the radiolabeled tumor cells in the liver of mice was found when CH-271 was co-injected with tumor cells. L5178Y-ML25 cells adhered both concentration- and time-dependently to the substrates precoated with fibronectin, laminin and reconstituted basement membrane, Matrigel. The tumor cell adhesions to the substrates were inhibited in the presence of CH-271. The tumor cell interaction with CH-271-substrate was inhibited by heparin, and monoclonal antibodies (IST-1 or IST-2) against the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin. However, monoclonal antibodies against the cell-binding domain failed to block the interaction. Similarly, CH-271-mediated antimetastatic activity was also inhibited by the treatment of CH-271 with IST-1 before the co-injection with tumor cells, whereas monoclonal antibody against the cell-binding domain had no effect. Thus, the antimetastatic effect of CH-271 fusion fragment on liver metastasis of L5178Y-ML25 cells may be partly due to interference with the adhesive interaction of tumor cells with extracellular matrix or basement membrane components by a heparin-binding domain-dependent mechanism.","['Matsumoto, Y', 'Saiki, I', 'Makabe, T', 'Yoneda, J', 'Murata, J', 'Kimizuka, F', 'Ishizaki, Y', 'Kato, I', 'Azuma, I']","['Matsumoto Y', 'Saiki I', 'Makabe T', 'Yoneda J', 'Murata J', 'Kimizuka F', 'Ishizaki Y', 'Kato I', 'Azuma I']","['Institute of Immunological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Basement Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01767.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1991 Oct;82(10):1130-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01767.x.,,PMC5918258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The polypeptides containing heparin-binding domain, H-271 and CH-271, were able to inhibit liver metastasis when co-injected i.v. with L5178Y-ML25 T-lymphoma cells, while C-274 with cell-binding domain showed much weaker antimetastatic activity. Treatment with H-271 or CH-271 substantially prolonged the survival time of mice injected i.v. with L5178Y-ML25 cells. CH-271, containing cell- and heparin-binding domains, was more antimetastatic than H-271. The reason why CH-271 was more effective in inhibiting liver metastasis than H-271 can not be explained in terms of a difference in the stability in the circulation or in the molecular size of the polypeptide. The polypeptides used in this study did not affect the tumor cell growth or viability in vitro. CH-271 was found to be still active in inhibiting liver metastasis even when natural killer cells or macrophages were removed from this system. Furthermore, multiple administrations of CH-271 after tumor implantation effectively inhibited liver metastasis and enhanced the survival rate as compared with H-271, C-274 and untreated control. Thus, the fusion of H-271 with C-274 (i.e. CH-271) augments the antimetastatic property of H-271, possibly through the interaction between tumor cells and the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin.","['Saiki, I', 'Matsumoto, Y', 'Murata, J', 'Makabe, T', 'Yoneda, J', 'Okuyama, H', 'Kimizuka, F', 'Ishizaki, Y', 'Kato, I', 'Azuma, I']","['Saiki I', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Murata J', 'Makabe T', 'Yoneda J', 'Okuyama H', 'Kimizuka F', 'Ishizaki Y', 'Kato I', 'Azuma I']","['Section of Chemistry, Hokkaido University, Sapporo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '71012-19-6 (asialo GM1 ganglioside)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fibronectins/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', '*G(M1) Ganglioside', 'Glycosphingolipids/physiology', 'Heparin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/prevention & control/secondary', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Analysis']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01766.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1991 Oct;82(10):1120-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01766.x.,,PMC5918250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth-inhibitory effect on a murine leukemia cell line L1210 following treatment with NKT-01 was time-dependent, and there was little or no effect on the syntheses of DNA and RNA. Thus, the inhibitory activity of NKT-01 was not attributable to the inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. The influence of NKT-01 on cell cycle progression was studied by flow cytometric analysis. Bromodeoxyuridine/DNA distribution patterns in cells that were treated for 72 h, showed that the growth inhibition is due to the delay of cell cycle progression but not to cytotoxicity. This finding was also supported by evidence that the treated cells were re-proliferative in fresh medium. In addition, a majority of drug-treated cells was prevented from traversing from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase by 144 h or longer exposure to NKT-01.

The extent to which an epidemiologic study supports a causal relation between radiation exposure and increased cancer risk can be evaluated using a set of criteria that have become known as Hill's postulates. In our review, epidemiologic studies yielded results that were biologically plausible and were supported by experimental data, but in almost all of the studies the methodologies were not adequate for evaluating causality. In the majority of cases, the methodologies did not permit examination of dose-response associations, making it impossible to support or refute causal relations. We suggest that investigators consider these issues when designing studies and employ dose reconstruction methodology to estimate radiation doses for specific individuals and population groups.","['Shleien, B', 'Ruttenber, A J', 'Sage, M']","['Shleien B', 'Ruttenber AJ', 'Sage M']","['Scinta, Inc., Silver Spring, MD 20902.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Energy', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-199112000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1991 Dec;61(6):699-713. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199112000-00001.,,,,,,,86,,,,,,,,,

During subsequent years, various epidemiological studies have investigated the claim in more detail. Geographical analyses of childhood leukemia incidence in the northern region and mortality in England and Wales using routinely available data made the first contribution. As a result, it was confirmed that leukemia rates in the area, particularly the neighboring village of Seascale, were high compared to other districts, although not totally extreme. Cohort studies of children born in Seascale or attending schools in Seascale were carried out to resolve some of the difficulties of interpretation of geographical analysis. Cohort studies indicated that the excess of leukemia was concentrated among children born in Seascale and was not found among those moving in after birth and suggested that any causal factors may be acting before birth or very early in life. A case-control study of leukemia (and lymphoma) among young people in West Cumbria has examined potentially important individual factors in detail. The study demonstrated a relationship between the raised incidence of leukemia in children and father's recorded external radiation dose during work at Sellafield before his child's conception. The association can effectively explain statistically the observed geographical excess.","['Gardner, M J']",['Gardner MJ'],"['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit (University of Southampton), Southampton General Hospital, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'England/epidemiology', '*Fathers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', '*Occupational Exposure']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.94-1567974 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1991 Aug;94:5-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.94-1567974.,,PMC1567974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first two are expressed in all tissues, whereas TR beta-2 appears to be expressed only in the pituitary. The differences in the roles of the three receptor isoforms are unknown, but may involve preferential interaction with different subsets of thyroid hormone-regulated genes in different tissues. We tested the binding of the three TR isoforms to putative thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) from genes that are expressed in the pituitary or other tissues and are regulated by thyroid hormone. In vitro translated 35S-labeled rat TR alpha-1, rat TR beta-2, and human TR beta-1 receptors were bound to a battery of biotinylated synthetic deoxyribonucleotides containing naturally occurring putative TREs from genes expressed either in only pituitary (rat glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit, TSH beta-subunit, and GH) or in nonpituitary (rat alpha-myosin heavy chain, malic enzyme, and Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter) tissues. All three receptor forms bound to each of the TREs. TR beta-2 did not show preferential binding to TREs of pituitary-specific genes compared to TR beta-1. Additionally, TR alpha-1 had a similar TRE-binding pattern as the TR beta s, except for possibly less binding to rat glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit TRE. Finally, rat pituitary and liver nuclear extracts enhanced TR binding to TREs, with the greatest enhancement seen with the alpha-subunit TRE. These studies suggest that all TR isoforms bind similarly to native TREs. Also, TR binding to TREs can be differentially enhanced by interactions with nuclear proteins.","['Yen, P M', 'Darling, D S', 'Chin, W W']","['Yen PM', 'Darling DS', 'Chin WW']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thyroid Hormones/*pharmacology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo-129-6-3331 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1991 Dec;129(6):3331-6. doi: 10.1210/endo-129-6-3331.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-myc was expressed in five of six AML cases studied, in one of nine acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases, and in several leukemia cell lines, while c-myc mRNA was detected in all leukemias and leukemia cell lines studied. Coexpression of all three myc genes was observed in Dami and MOLT-4 cell lines and in two AMLs, and either L-myc or N-myc was coexpressed with c-myc in several other cases.

Administration of dThd or HU (0.5 to 3 mmol/L) in conjunction with high concentrations of Ara-C either sequentially or simultaneously lead to enhanced (and in some cases a supra-additive) inhibition of HL-60/Ara-C suspension culture growth and soft agar colony formation. In addition, exposure of cells to 0.5 mmol/L dThd or HU for 48 hours significantly increased the percentage of HL-60/Ara-C in S-phase.

To examine this possibility further, we have compared Ca2+ transport in platelets and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a megakaryoblastic cell line which synthesizes GP IIb-IIIa complexes that appear to be identical to those found on platelets. As with platelets, the results show the presence in unstimulated HEL cells of a rapidly exchangeable cytosolic Ca2+ pool that is in equilibrium with an intracellular sequestered Ca2+ pool and with extracellular Ca2+. Allowing for differences in cell size, the rate constants for Ca2+ exchange in HEL cells were similar to those in platelets. As in platelets, thrombin caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that was due partly to enhanced Ca2+ influx and partly to the mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores. Incubation of the HEL cells with EDTA at 37 degrees C irreversibly altered the GP IIb-IIIa complex as evidenced by decreased binding of a complex-specific monoclonal antibody. In platelets this was accompanied by a 40% decrease in the rate of Ca2+ influx. However, in HEL cells there was neither a diminution in Ca2+ influx nor a reduction in the magnitude of the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ caused by thrombin. These results show that the parameters of Ca2+ distribution and movement are similar in HEL cells and platelets and that in HEL cells, as in platelets, the GP IIb-IIIa complex can be altered by removing Ca2+. However, unlike platelets, dissociation of the HEL cell IIb-IIIa complex has no discernible effect on plasma membrane Ca2+ transport. This suggests that earlier observations in platelets correlating changes in the rate of Ca2+ influx with changes in the number of intact IIb-IIIa complexes reflect an indirect, rather than a direct, role of these proteins in Ca2+ transport.","['Suldan, Z', 'Brass, L F']","['Suldan Z', 'Brass LF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Biological Transport', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75264-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Dec 1;78(11):2887-93.,,,['HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well-defined morphologic stages of differentiation ranging from primitive erythroblasts to nuclei-extruding normoblasts were seen. Transforming growth factor-beta inhibited GM-CSF- and Epo-dependent growth, but not erythroid maturation. Indirect immunofluorescence using globin chain-specific monoclonal antibodies detected fetal, but not adult hemoglobin in the uninduced cells. beta-globin was induced and gamma-globin was increased after Epo exposure.

Quantitative S1 analysis of beta-like globin transcripts showed very low levels of epsilon- and beta-globin expression and high levels of gamma-globin expression in cells maintained in GM-CSF. Five days after induction with Epo, epsilon message decreased to barely detectable levels while gamma and beta transcripts increased threefold and 20-fold, respectively.

No single group showed significantly higher levels when compared to healthy children. All patients showing high IL-1 or TNF levels had fevers at the time of diagnosis. These findings suggest that fever in bacterial infection is associated with the production of IL-1 but not TNF (except in cases of septic shock), whereas fever in acute leukemia may be associated with the production of either IL-1 or TNF.

In addition, hyperdiploid B cells were found to possess a unique chromosome pair which lacked terminal C-bands. This observation allowed analysis of the fate of transferred NZB hyperdiploid B cells into unirradiated recipients. The hyperdiploid B cells were found to expand in recipients and become the dominant population in several lymphoid organs.

In Ca(2+)-rich medium (1.8 mM) however there was a large increase in both parameters. We showed recently (Her et al., 1990) that hydrocortisone (HC) and dexamethasone markedly suppressed the elevated [Ca2+]i induced by antigen. Following HC pretreatment, there was a modest (35%) suppression of [Ca2+]i elevation induced by submaximal (0.1 microM) as well as maximal (1 microM) doses of ionomycin (nevertheless, 8 fold increase above basal level was still observed), LTC4 formation, however, was only inhibited (47%) by HC when induced by submaximal dose of ionomycin, but not that induced by higher doses of ionomycin. Phorbol ester (TPA) abolished elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by antigen. Short treatment with TPA had a modest inhibitory (28%) effect on elevation of [Ca2+]i and on LTC4 formation (23%) induced by ionomycin. It is proposed that high [Ca2+]i, possibly originated mainly from extracellular source, is essential for induction of LTC4 formation.","['Her, E', 'Zor, U']","['Her E', 'Zor U']","['Department of Hormone Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Lipid Mediat,Journal of lipid mediators,8913460,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (SRS-A)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Culture Media', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'SRS-A/*biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Lipid Mediat. 1991 Sep-Oct;4(2):175-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These changes were followed by sequential increases in mRNAs for enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Namely, mRNAs for the erythroid-specific ALAS, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase started to increase at 12, 18, 18-24 and 24 h, respectively.

At 3 hr which is a relatively short interval compared to whole S phase, modification of cells by parasitic invasion was most remarkable. The number of Toxoplasma that penetrated was increased to more than six times. The shape of the cells became sludgy and almost indiscernible by strong accessibility of parasites only for an hour of mid-S phase.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated 15-PGDH activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) also stimulated the enzyme activity, although a much delayed stimulation was observed. Western blot studies indicated that PMA increased significantly a 28 kDa immunoreactive protein characteristic of 15-PGDH. L-[35S]Methionine labelling of the PMA-treated cells showed a similar enhancement over the control cells. These studies indicate that PMA induced synthesis of 15-PGDH. Stimulation of 15-PGDH activity by PMA or DMSO appears to be mediated by protein kinase C activation, since an inactive analogue of PMA failed to induce the effect, and both staurosporine and H-7 blocked the stimulation. Stimulation by PMA was optimal at 10 nM and less effective at higher concentrations. Western blot studies indicated that a similar, if not greater, amount of enzyme protein was induced at high concentrations of PMA, suggesting that enzyme inactivation might be occurring. Possible enzyme inactivation by protein kinase C activation was further examined by incubating DMSO-treated cells with a high concentration of PMA (50 nM). Time-dependent inactivation of 15-PGDH within the first 1 h was observed and this inactivation was partially blocked by staurosporine and H-7. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that 15-PGDH had a rapid turnover rate (t 1/2 = 47 min), and PMA shortened the half-life of the enzyme (t 1/2 = 33 min), suggesting that PMA might have an additional effect on 15-PGDH degradation. The rapid turnover of 15-PGDH indicates that the enzyme activity depends on continued enzyme synthesis, and this could be susceptible to hormone and drug control mechanisms.","['Xun, C Q', 'Tian, Z G', 'Tai, H H']","['Xun CQ', 'Tian ZG', 'Tai HH']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40536-0082.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.141 (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases/*biosynthesis', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'NAD/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2790553 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Oct 15;279 ( Pt 2):553-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2790553.,,PMC1151639,['HL-32727/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last years there has been a remarkable increase of publications about this syndrome in the equine. The clinical leucosis key recommended by us has been confirmed in principle considering the latest literature. In about 70 individual symptoms which can be clinically observed in equine with leucosis 11 can be considered as main symptoms because of their frequency; they are again classified in primary (lymph node tumours including splenomegaly--loss of condition, weakness--cachexia, weight loss, periphery oedema), secondary (anorexia, inappetence--fever--paleness of mucous membrane--anaemia--tachycardia) and accessory (incoordination--tachypnoea, dyspnoea--apathy, lethargy) main symptoms. Furthermore in future it will be necessary to take into more consideration the symptoms ""recurrent colic"" and ""hydrothorax"" within differential diagnosis. The main symptom ""incoordination"" (ataxia, asynergy, paresis, paralysis) is used by us more precisely only in case of impairment of nervous system by neoplastic infiltrations and does not signify as possible symptoms of general physical weakness, for example faltering, staggering, tumbling or lameness. The morphological classification follows further on our previous recommendation. There exist generalized forms with tumour infiltrations in abdominal and in thoracic cavity as well as especially in peripheral lymph nodes. On the other hand there are characteristic manifestations in certain regions of the body, which establish distinctly the clinical symptomatology.

The effect of CE was irreversible and ADM activity was potentiated only in the presence of CE. While, CE could not augment anticancer activities of mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We also found an increase of cellular plasma membrane potential in the presence of CE. In physiological condition, ADM was charged positively, while MMC or 5-FU was neutrally charged compound. Thus, we suggest that CE can potentiate the activity of positively charged anticancer drugs by increasing plasma membrane potential. Since electronegative plasma membrane potential exerts a net driving force which attracts and retains positively charged compound, it may be accompanied with an increase of drug accumulation.","['Nishiyama, M', 'Aogi, K', 'Saeki, S', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Toge, T']","['Nishiyama M', 'Aogi K', 'Saeki S', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Toge T']","['Dept. of Surgery, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Ito, T. Tanaka, T. Yoshida, K. Onoda, H. Ohta, M. Hagiwara, Y. Itoh, M. Ogura, H. Saito, and H. Hidaka, 1988, J. Cell Biol. 107, 929). In the present study, we analyzed the roles of the intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) and diacylglycerol (DG) levels in thrombin-induced translocation of PKC using MEG-01 cells. When the cells were treated with thrombin (0.5 U/ml), PKC was translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane after 15 s, and the maximal membrane association was observed after 90 s. The [Ca2+]i of the cells rapidly increased (15 s) and reached a maximum level at 60 s which was sustained for a total of 600 s after thrombin addition. The increase in DG was biphasic with the first phase occurring in the first 15 s and the increase during the second phase lasting less than 600 s. The experiments without extracellular Ca2+ indicated that Ca2+ efflux accompanied by DG in the first phase was sufficient to initiate the membrane association of the PKC and that the large Ca2+ influx enhanced the binding. PKC returned to the cytosol within 600 s despite high levels of both [Ca2+]i and DG. We found that a relatively selective PKC inhibitor, H-7, enhanced thrombin-induced translocation of PKC without modulating [Ca2+]i or DG levels. These results indicate that certain protein phosphorylation events, potentially those mediated by PKC, may be responsible for, at least in part, inhibiting membrane association and further activation of the enzyme.","['Ito, T', 'Kozawa, O', 'Hidaka, H', 'Saito, H']","['Ito T', 'Kozawa O', 'Hidaka H', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (1,2-diacylglycerol)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(91)90126-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(91)90126-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1991 Dec;291(2):218-24. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(91)90126-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that differentiation of HL60 cells with DMSO results in coordinate induction of 5-LO and 5-LO activating protein (FLAP). The production of LTB4, 5-LO protein, 5-LO mRNa and FLAP RNA increased coordinately. However, two approaches demonstrated no increase in the initiation of transcription of 5-LO and FLAP pre-mRNA and no changes in the mRNA half lives. Moreover, cycloheximide inhibits the induction of the mRNAs and proteins. Thus, we suggest that 5-LO and FLAP are coordinately regulated in HL60 cells via mechanisms involving changes in RNA processing. To better understand potential mechanisms involved, we have cloned and sequenced several human 5-LO introns and compared them to analogous rat 5-LO introns. A number of regions of potential regulatory significances are conserved and may be important in controlling the rate of pre-mRNA processing.","['Crooke, S T', 'Monia, B P', 'Chiang, M Y', 'Bennett, C F']","['Crooke ST', 'Monia BP', 'Chiang MY', 'Bennett CF']","['ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, California 92008.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Alox5ap protein, rat)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Leukotrienes/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb37968.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1991;629:120-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb37968.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Study of 391 consecutive patients with uniformly treated multiple myeloma, followed until death in 63% of patients. SETTING: Tertiary, referral cancer center. PATIENTS: A total of 391 consecutive, previously untreated, symptomatic patients with various stages of multiple myeloma. INTERVENTION: Various chemotherapy regimens that included doxorubicin or glucocorticoids, or both, with a consistent response rate (53%). MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included clinical response based on a 75% reduction of calculated tumor load and survival time from treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven percent of patients showed a high serum LDH level of more than 5.0 mukat/L (300 U/L). An elevated LDH level was seen more frequently with a rise in the tumor load; an increased level was present in 26% of patients with high tumor mass. A high LDH level was associated with plasma cell leukemia or lymphoma-like clinical features (43%) and with plasma cell hypodiploidy (17%). Only 20% of patients with elevated LDH levels responded to chemotherapy compared with a response rate of 57% for patients with low levels of LDH. Using multivariate analysis, LDH was a significant independent predictor of response (P = 0.001), with an odds ratio of 0.25 (95% Cl, 0.11 to 0.57). A high LDH level was associated with a short median survival (9 months) and showed the highest relative risk (2.63; Cl, 1.75 to 3.95; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of the LDH level suggests the presence of occult extraosseous disease and high tumor mass. The LDH level is a predictor of a poor prognosis in selected patients who should be considered for early intensive treatment.","['Dimopoulos, M A', 'Barlogie, B', 'Smith, T L', 'Alexanian, R']","['Dimopoulos MA', 'Barlogie B', 'Smith TL', 'Alexanian R']","['University of Texas M.

We have developed a rapid screening method, termed allele specific restriction analysis (ASRA), for detection of N-ras mutations at these three critical codons in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patient DNA samples are amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using primers that induce restriction sites in normal but not mutant N-ras alleles. We have used ASRA to identify 5 point mutations in four out of 19 patients at initial presentation of de novo AML. Three patients had one mutation at codon 12, 13, or 61 respectively, while a fourth patient had concurrent mutations at codons 12 and 13. N-ras mutations were more common in patients over 65 years of age (P less than 0.04), but did not correlate with FAB classification, attainment of complete remission, disease free survival, or overall survival. ASRA can also be used as the first step in a more sensitive approach to the detection of ras mutations. When ASRA was combined with allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization the sensitivity and specificity of these assays were increased. This allowed identification of additional low level mutations in two patients. The data presented here constitute the first complete analysis of N-ras mutations in leukemia by ASRA and include the first identification of three concurrent N-ras mutations in a single leukemic patient. By facilitating sensitive sequential studies, ASRA should contribute to our understanding of the role of N-ras mutations in leukemogenesis.","['Todd, A V', 'Ireland, C M', 'Radloff, T J', 'Kronenberg, H', 'Iland, H J']","['Todd AV', 'Ireland CM', 'Radloff TJ', 'Kronenberg H', 'Iland HJ']","['Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Alleles', 'Codon', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides', '*Restriction Mapping']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830380310 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Nov;38(3):207-13. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830380310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Host-type hematopoietic cells were detected in cultured bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) from 4 out of 6 patients studied, who were all in complete remission. In 2 patients of the mixed chimeras, the relative amount of host-derived YDNA from BMMC increased after methylcellulose cultures for 14 days. Analysis of individual colonies derived from granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) from these mixed chimeras, including 2 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), revealed approximately 30% of total colonies were host-type, although no evidence for the existence of residual Ph1 positive cells was obtained by using polymerase chain reaction for detecting bcr-abl chimeric messenger RNA in the 2 CML patients. These findings provide direct evidence that considerable numbers of host-derived normal hematopoietic progenitors survive and persist for a long term in a certain population of marrow recipients, after BMT following supralethal radiochemotherapy.","['Nakatsumi, T', 'Nakao, S', 'Ohtaguro, M', 'Chujo, T', 'Tsuchiya, H', 'Niki, T', 'Shiobara, S', 'Mori, T', 'Nagai, K', 'Matsuda, T']","['Nakatsumi T', 'Nakao S', 'Ohtaguro M', 'Chujo T', 'Tsuchiya H', 'Niki T', 'Shiobara S', 'Mori T', 'Nagai K', 'Matsuda T']","['Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*DNA Probes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', '*Y Chromosome']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830380305 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Nov;38(3):178-83. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830380305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know the germline contains hundreds of VH genes, and if we assume that most of these are used in the generation of antibody diversity, then we must ask how have the a allotype-encoding regions been maintained over time? On the other hand, if we assume that only one (or a small number) of these VH gene(s) is (are) used in VDJ gene rearrangements, then, how is antibody diversity generated? To address these questions, we have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the 3'-most germline VH genes from the a1, a2 and a3 chromosomes and shown in each case that the 3'-most H gene, VH1-a1, VH1-a2, or VH1-a3, encodes an a1, a2 or a3 VH region, respectively. Analysis of rearranged VDJ genes from leukemic B cells showed that VH1 was utilized in these rearrangements. Based on these data, we propose that the allelic inheritance of the VH allotypes is explained by the preferential usage of the VH1 gene in VDJ rearrangements. Support for this hypothesis was obtained from analysis of the mutant rabbit Alicia in which most serum Ig molecules do not have VHa allotypic specificities, but instead have so-called VHa-negative Ig molecules. In this rabbit, VH1 is not expressed as it has been deleted. Analysis of cDNA clones from spleen of Alicia rabbits suggests that the expressed VHa-negative molecules also are encoded by a single germline VH gene. Thus, we suggest that nearly all rabbit VH regions are encoded by one to two germline VH genes and that antibody diversity is generated primarily by somatic hypermutation and gene conversion.","['Knight, K L', 'Becker, R S', 'DiPietro, L A']","['Knight KL', 'Becker RS', 'DiPietro LA']","['Department of Microbiology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Allotypes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Antibody Diversity/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Allotypes/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-5943-2_26 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1991;292:235-44. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-5943-2_26.,"['VDJ', 'VH1']",,,"['GENBANK/S63477', 'GENBANK/S63482', 'GENBANK/S63491']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to a two-fold increase in CFU-S13 recovery was observed, from 9.7 x 10(-5) cells in untreated controls to 17.6 x 10(-5) cells when 10U/ml LIF is added to the culture medium. Intermediate concentrations of LIF (.1U/ml and 1U/ml) were not significantly different from the control. Histological analysis of spleen colonies harvested thirteen days posttransplant demonstrated that LIF does not cause a detectable alteration in the differentiative potential of CFU-S13. The efficiency of retroviral-vector infection in CFU-S13 is also improved, from 15% (24/158) in untreated controls to 91% (116/127) at a LIF concentration of 10U/ml. LIF concentrations of .1U/ml and 1U/ml increased infection efficiency to 35% (14/40) and 71% (37/51), respectively. Analysis of proviral insertion sites in spleen colonies indicated that some CFU-S13 precursors were infected in the LIF-treated marrows, but no identical pairs were detected in the controls. Finally, long-term expression of provirally-encoded human adenosine deaminase (hADA) was measured in hematopoietic tissues of bone marrow transplant recipients six months posttransplant. In all tissues analyzed (spleen, thymus, bone marrow, splenic B cells, peritoneal macrophages, and blood) differentiated progeny of LIF-treated marrows had higher levels of hADA than untreated controls. Tenfold increases in levels of hADA are detected in some tissues, but levels were variable. These experiments demonstrate that LIF directly or indirectly enhances retroviral infection efficiency of hematopoietic stem cells, and might be used to improved existing gene transfer protocols.","['Fletcher, F A', 'Moore, K A', 'Williams, D E', 'Anderson, D', 'Maliszewski, C', 'Belmont, J W']","['Fletcher FA', 'Moore KA', 'Williams DE', 'Anderson D', 'Maliszewski C', 'Belmont JW']","['Institute for Molecular Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Deaminase/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transfection/*drug effects']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-5943-2_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1991;292:131-8. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-5943-2_15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first technique allows detection of Ag expressed on the cytoplasmic membrane of living cells, whilst the second shows the presence of intracytoplasmic Ag on fixed cells. In general, the percentages of lymphoid Ag expression on AML cells are relatively low with both IE (15.2%) and IF (17.4%). We found a good correlation between the two methods for CD2 (4/4), CD7 (4/5), CD20 (1/1) and CD4 (2/2). The Ag CD19, CD21 and CD8 were negative in all cases, both with IE and with IF. CD3 (2 cases) and CD22 (1 case) were only evident with IE. CD10 was seen in 1 case with IF, whilst it was found more frequently with IE.

IGIV preparations are approved for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent bacterial infections due to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The mechanism of action in the first two indications is passive replacement of antibodies, but in ITP the mechanism is not clearly established. The clinical literature on the use of IGIV for these indications is summarized. In patients with ITP, platelet counts return to safe levels and the number of infections is reduced in patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency treated with IGIV. The use of IGIV in pregnant women and premature infants is controversial. Adverse reactions are primarily related to infusion rate, activation of complement, and anaphylactic reactions to a component of the product. There is minimal to no risk of viral transmission with IGIV therapy. IGIV also has been administered safely on an outpatient or homecare basis. This has led to a feeling of greater control by patients over their chronic illness. Other uses of IGIV are under investigation.

In the present study, this method was compared quantitatively and qualitatively to the leading front assay. Further, the potential usefulness of a simple shape-change assay as a rapid measure of chemotactic activation of neutrophils was assessed and compared with the migration assays. It was concluded that the two migration assays are superior to the shape-change assay, even though both suffer from certain methodological drawbacks.

The results indicated that BMT from MHC-incompatible allogeneic (B10) donor significantly improved the survival of the treated mice as compared with that from syngeneic (C3H) donor. When donor (B10) bone marrow cells were treated with either anti-Thy 1.2 or anti-Lyt 2.2 antibody plus complement prior to BMT, a beneficial GVL effect was completely abolished. On the other hand, BMT from MHC-compatible allogeneic donors (B10.BR, CBA, AKR) failed to show an improvement in survival. However, intentional enhancement of GVH reaction by preimmunization of B10.BR donor mice with a relatively small number (10(4) approximately 10(5] of C3H spleen cells or by an addition of B10.BR lymph node cells to the donor bone marrow resulted in a significant improvement in survival. The depletion of all T cells completely abrogated the GVL effect, while the depletion of either Lyt 2+ or L3T4+ T cells from donor (B10.BR) bone marrow resulted in only partial, if any, abrogation of GVL effect. The results indicate that GVL effect observed in leukemic mice treated with allogeneic BMT from MHC-compatible (B10.BR) and -incompatible (B10) donors was totally dependent on T cells contaminated in the donor bone marrow, and suggest that the roles of T cell subsets in the induction of GVL effect were different between MHC-compatible (B10.BR) and -incompatible (B10), allogeneic BMT.","['Aizawa, S', 'Sado, T']","['Aizawa S', 'Sado T']","['Division of Physiology and Pathology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Isoantibodies/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199111000-00025 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1991 Nov;52(5):885-9. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199111000-00025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, rhIL-1 indirectly stimulates normal haemopoietic cell proliferation without any influence on the differentiation, and can also induce lysozyme secretion by leukaemic cells. On the other hand, rhIL-2 is capable of indirectly stimulating the proliferation of monocytic precursors. Nevertheless, the effect of both factors on the expression of Fc receptors or on the proliferation of cells of myeloid origin has not been evaluated thus far. In order to assess whether these interleukins take part in the induction to proliferation of Fc receptor expression by homogeneous populations of myeloid cells, two leukaemic cell lines were used in this work, namely, WR19M.1, macrophagic, and WEHI3BD-, myelomonocytic. The results achieved show that: 1) rhIL-1 strongly stimulated the expression of Fc receptors in both leukaemic cell lines; 2) rhIL-1 does not stimulate the proliferation of these lineages; 3) on the contrary, rhIL-2 stimulated cell proliferation in both leukaemic cell lines, and 4) rhIL-2 had no effect on the induction of Fc receptors or on the stimulation of lysozyme secretion.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the incidence and characteristics of the possible antigenic changes with regard to the diagnosis. Along with the classic markers, a panel comprised of 20 monoclonal antibodies against lymphoid and myeloid antigens was used. Major phenotypic changes (acquisition of myeloid antigens CD13 and CD33) were found only in one case amongst the relapsing ALL (7%). Seven other patients (47%) showed minor phenotyping changes, including: 1) acquisition or loss of antigens (2 cases); 2) changes in more then 50% of any antigen's expression (4 cases); 3) both (1 case). These results might suggest that antigenic changes are rather frequent in relapsing ALL; however, none of such changes modified in our experience the phenotypic diagnosis so any change of this last should be regarded as an exceptional event. The majority of these antigenic changes consisted of the loss of maturation antigens (CD20) or acquisition of early markers (TdT, HLA-DR) or activation markers (CD38); this would mean that the relapsing blast cells show a functional status of activation and proliferation, with a phenotype more immature than that of the diagnosis, thus explaining the poorer prognosis of the patients in relapse. No phenotypic changes were found in the primary resistant ALL, which may indicate the persistence of the original cell clone without any alteration.","['Gomez, E', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Orfao, A', 'Canizo, M C', 'Ciudad, J', 'Lopez Borrasca, A']","['Gomez E', 'San Miguel JF', 'Gonzalez M', 'Orfao A', 'Canizo MC', 'Ciudad J', 'Lopez Borrasca A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico, Salamanca.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1991 Jun;36(3):201-4.,,,,,,,,Cambios fenotipicos de las leucemias agudas linfoblasticas en recaida y resistentes.,,,,,,,,

As a single agent in refractory disease, interferon in partially purified preparations and, more recently, recombinant alpha-interferon (rIFN) has demonstrated response rates of 10% to 20%. Because of its demonstrated activity as a single agent, various combinations of rIFN with chemotherapy have been evaluated. The Italian Myeloma Study Group has found that maintenance therapy with rIFN alpha 2b prolongs the time to relapse following a year of standard chemotherapy. The Cancer and Acute Leukemia Group B has evaluated a regimen that combines rIFN alpha 2b with simultaneous melphalan and prednisone. In a third approach, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group has developed a regimen consisting of alternating cycles of VBMCP (vincristine, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) chemotherapy with rIFN alpha 2b. This regimen yields an 80% objective response rate, including 30% complete responses defined by disappearance of M-protein from serum and urine and complete morphologic normalization of the bone marrow. On preliminary analysis, the response duration and median survival were both approximately 1 year longer than generally observed in patients with multiple myeloma on standard regimens. Hematologic toxicity, although more severe than that observed previously with VBMCP alone, was not associated with increased infections or bleeding. To substantiate the observation of apparent increased activity of VBMCP + rIFN alpha 2b, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group is currently conducting a randomized comparison of this regimen with treatment using VBMCP alone.","['Oken, M M', 'Kyle, R A']","['Oken MM', 'Kyle RA']","['Virginia Piper Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN 55407.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Rate']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(91)90038-O [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1991 Oct;18(5 Suppl 7):30-2.,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,

Except for the patient with rhinocerebral mycosis, the diagnosis was not established during the patients' lifetime. 3 patients received systemic antimycotic therapy. Our observations suggest that infarctions of internal organs in immunocompromised patients should direct suspicion towards angio-related mycoses, not only of aspergillosis, but also of zygomycosis.","['Donhuijsen, K', 'Grothey, A', 'Volker, B', 'Dermoumi, H']","['Donhuijsen K', 'Grothey A', 'Volker B', 'Dermoumi H']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Universitatsklinik Essen.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/complications/drug therapy/*pathology']",1991/10/12 00:00,1991/10/12 00:01,['1991/10/12 00:00'],"['1991/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1991 Oct 12;121(41):1493-8.,,,,,,,40,Zygomykosen: Klinik und Pathologie bei 10 Patienten.,,,,,,,,

When the expression of MYC protein was evaluated by Western blot analysis, we found no correlation between c-myc gene alterations and p67 c-myc, which was expressed in the 15 samples studied. The analysis of expression also revealed various MYC-related proteins (115, 110 and 60 kD). These proteins were expressed at variable levels in all leukemic cells, other transformed cells, and in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) induced to proliferate with interleukin 2. We detected the 110 kD and 40 kD MYC-related proteins in fresh normal PBL and in samples from patients in complete remission. These studies indicate that the c-myc alterations and protein expression are unrelated to percentage of leukemic blasts, cell morphology or immunophenotype.

It causes leukemia in humans and a variety of solid tumors in rats and mice. Decades of research on benzene metabolism, pharmacokinetics, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity in vivo and in vitro are starting to converge on a small set of overlapping hypotheses about the most probable biological mechanisms of benzene toxicity and carcinogenicity. Although there is still room for surprises, it seems likely that the ultimate answer to the mystery of how benzene exerts its multiple effects will consist of elaborations and extensions of one or more of the current hypotheses. This paper reviews benzene health effects and biology, showing how various aspects of metabolism and cytotoxicity fit together with genotoxic and nongenotoxic effects to help explain how benzene may cause cancer. Its goals are: (i) to introduce the qualitative biological background needed for detailed quantitative dose-response modeling of benzene cancer risks; and (ii) to survey a rapidly evolving area of research that shows promise of producing fundamental insights into the mechanisms of toxicity and carcinogenesis for several chemicals--benzene and perhaps phenols, catechols, and other hydroxylated ring hydrocarbons--in the decade ahead.","['Cox, L A Jr']",['Cox LA Jr'],"['U.

In this paradigm, sphingomyelin hydrolysis by a sphingomyelinase generates ceramide, which may be converted to the protein kinase C inhibitor sphingosine or to ceramide 1-phosphate. Ceramide may have second-messenger function because it induces epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation, presumably on Thr-669 in A-431 cells. The present studies describe a kinase that may mediate ceramide action. With a 19-amino acid epidermal growth factor receptor peptide containing Thr-669, a membrane-bound activity that phosphorylated the peptide was detected in A-431 cells. Activity was linearly related to ATP (0.3-300 microM) and peptide concentration (0.02-1 mg/ml), possessed a physiologic pH optimum (pH 7.0-7.4), and was Mg(2+)-dependent. Other cations--Ca2+, Mn2+, and Zn(2+)--were ineffective. Natural and synthetic ceramide induced time- and concentration-dependent enhancement of kinase activity. Ceramide (0.5 microM) increased kinase activity 2-fold by 30 s, and activity remained elevated for at least 15 min. As little as 0.001 microM ceramide was effective, and 1 microM ceramide induced maximal phosphorylation. Sphingosine was similarly effective. Because tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha rapidly induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, its effects on kinase activity were assessed. Kinase activity was increased 1.5-fold at 5 min and 2-fold at 2 hr in membranes derived from TNF-stimulated cells. The effective concentration range was 3 pM-30 nM TNF. Exogenous ceramide induced a similar effect. In sum, these studies demonstrate the existence of an unusual Mg(2+)-dependent ceramide-activated protein kinase that may mediate some aspects of TNF-alpha function.","['Mathias, S', 'Dressler, K A', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Mathias S', 'Dressler KA', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.22.10009 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Nov 15;88(22):10009-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.22.10009.,,PMC52856,"['CA-09512-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA quantitation by image analysis indicates that cytomegalic cells of the adrenal cortex, pancreas, and pituitary contain increased amounts of DNA (hyperdiploid aneuploid), with adenocytes containing over 25 times the normal amount of DNA in some instances. These data and morphological features suggest that cytomegaly is a reflection of polyploidy due to either partial DNA replication or partial DNA replication plus other modes of polyploidization.

Complications associated with rectal lesions may be severe enough to cause life-threatening septicemia. Clinical research evaluating the effects of preventive perirectal skin care is scarce. This study's purpose was to determine whether using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in a prophylactic perirectal skin-care regimen decreases perirectal infections and whether it produces more skin irritation than a nonmedicated skin cleanser. The sample consisted of 40 patients, 16 of whom were randomized to use chlorhexidine and 24 of whom were randomized to use nonmedicated skin cleanser. Chi-square and t-tests were used to analyze the incidence of skin breakdown and rectal infections; the correlation between the two factors; a positive history of rectal infections, fissures, or hemorrhoids; presence of hemorrhoids; severity of diarrhea; and duration and severity of granulocytopenia. A positive relationship was found between the severity of granulocytopenia and the incidence of rectal infections (p = 0.02). No significant difference was seen in the occurrence of perirectal infections (p = 0.35) or skin breakdown (p = 0.18) between the two groups. The data suggest that CHG does not offer increased protection against perirectal infections in patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, nor is it more irritating than a nonmedicated skin cleanser. Further studies are needed to examine the efficacy of hygienic measures such as using skin disinfectants to prevent infections in patients who are immunocompromised.","['Yeomans, A', 'Davitt, M', 'Peters, C A', 'Pastuszek, C', 'Cobb, S']","['Yeomans A', 'Davitt M', 'Peters CA', 'Pastuszek C', 'Cobb S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,"['MOR84MUD8E (chlorhexidine gluconate)', 'R4KO0DY52L (Chlorhexidine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/complications', 'Chlorhexidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hygiene', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proctitis/etiology/*prevention & control']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 1991 Sep-Oct;18(7):1207-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ets-1 gene is preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells. To understand the regulation of the ets-1 gene expression the regulatory sequences of this gene were identified and isolated. The promoter is found to be functioning in the lymphoid cell line Daudi and the erythromyeloid cell line K562 but not in the promyelocytic cell line HL60. Sequence analysis indicates that the ets-1 promoter does not contain the TATA or CAT box. It contains multiple transcription initiation sites in a tight cluster. The promoter contains one binding site each for AP1 and AP2. It has one definitive and five presumptive sp1-binding sites. In addition, the ets-1 promoter contains one ets-1 protein-binding site. Functional analysis has shown that c-jun enhances the activity of the ets-1 promoter, whereas the combination of c-fos and c-jun expressions has no synergistic effect. The expression of exogenous AP2 and ets-1 also enhances the activity of the ets-1 promoter. These results suggest that the AP1, AP2 and ets-1 proteins have a positive regulatory effect. The presence of the ets-1 protein-binding site indicates the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism for the expression of the ets-1 gene.

We therefore assessed the importance of potential risk factors for secondary AML in 734 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who attained complete remission and received continuation (maintenance) treatment according to different schedules of epipodophyllotoxin administration. RESULTS: Secondary AML was diagnosed in 21 of the 734 patients, in 17 of whom this complication was the initial adverse event. Prolonged administration of epipodophyllotoxin (teniposide with or without etoposide) twice weekly or weekly was independently associated with the development of secondary AML (P less than 0.01 by Cox regression analysis). The overall cumulative risk of AML at six years was 3.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 percent to 6.1 percent); but within the subgroups treated twice weekly or weekly, the risks were 12.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.7 percent to 25.4 percent) and 12.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.1 percent to 24.4 percent), respectively. In the subgroups not treated with epipodophyllotoxins or treated with them only during remission induction or every two weeks during continuation treatment, the highest cumulative risk was 1.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 percent to 6.1 percent). After adjustment for treatment frequency, there was no apparent relation between the total dose of epipodophyllotoxins and the development of secondary AML. The relative hazard of etoposide as compared with teniposide could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of epipodophyllotoxin-related AML depends largely on the schedule of drug administration. Other factors, including the cumulative dose of epipodophyllotoxin, radiotherapy, and the initial biologic features of the leukemic blast cells, do not appear to have critical roles.","['Pui, C H', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Hancock, M L', 'Rivera, G K', 'Evans, W E', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Head, D R', 'Behm, F G', 'Mahmoud, M H', 'Sandlund, J T']","['Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Hancock ML', 'Rivera GK', 'Evans WE', 'Raimondi SC', 'Head DR', 'Behm FG', 'Mahmoud MH', 'Sandlund JT', 'et al.']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Podophyllotoxin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage']",1991/12/12 00:00,1991/12/12 00:01,['1991/12/12 00:00'],"['1991/12/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/12 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199112123252402 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 Dec 12;325(24):1682-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199112123252402.,,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current approaches to the treatment of CML are chemotherapy (conventional or aggressive with immuno-modulators) and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Neither of the above treatment modalities results in long-term remission or cure. Hence, an alternative approach which aims at correcting the genetic defect should be considered. Taking advantage of the consistent abnormal presence of the bcr-c-abl gene in the treated and untreated CML patients at all stages, a gene therapy at the level of blocking mRNA might be considered. Such an antisense RNA therapy should include removal of patient's bone marrow, administration of the gene for constitutive expression of an antisense RNA for the bcr-c-abl fusion gene into the myeloid stem cells and reinjecting the engineered marrow into the patient.

The growth inhibition of the KG-1 cells was accompanied by morphological changes into cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Histochemically, the ET-18-OCH3-treated KG-1 cells increase 17-fold in the nonspecific esterase activity when compared to control non-treated cells, whereas they responded negatively in the assay for the reduction of soluble nitroblue tetrazolium into insoluble blue formazan deposits (a marker for cells of the granulocytic lineage). Taken together, our data revealed that the synthetic ether-lipid inhibited the growth of the KG-1 acute myelogenous leukemic cells while inducing the differentiation of these cells into cells of the monocyte/macrophage-lineage.

Both types of receptors on monocytes as well as on leukemic blasts could be down-modulated in a similar fashion by IL-4 and activators of protein kinase C (PKC), but not by the calcium ionophore A23187. The down-modulation by PKC activators was caused by an increased internalization, degradation and release of radiolabeled IL-4 in the medium. Finally, the functionality of the IL-4 receptors were tested on AML cells with a 3H-thymidine proliferation assay. In 8/11 cases IL-4 affected AML proliferation. These data demonstrate two different binding sites for IL-4 on normal and leukemic cells, which can be modulated by external activation signals in an analogous way.","['Wagteveld, A J', 'van Zanten, A K', 'Esselink, M T', 'Halie, M R', 'Vellenga, E']","['Wagteveld AJ', 'van Zanten AK', 'Esselink MT', 'Halie MR', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Sep;5(9):782-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper describes the clonal origin of cells in a patient with Philadelphia-chromosome negative, M-bcr rearrangement-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, observed in two episodes of lymphoid blast crisis (BC), the intervening chronic phases (CP), and following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Serial analysis of immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain (IgJH, IgCK), beta-T-cell receptor (beta-TcR) and bcr major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) gene rearrangements was performed. Clonal IgJH rearrangements present in cells of the first lymphoblastic crisis (BC1) were altered during the chronic phase post-treatment (CP1), and were again altered in recurrent blast crisis (BC2). In addition, the M-bcr gene rearrangement present in BC1 and CP1 was absent from cells in BC2. These observations suggest that the course of clinical neoplastic disorders may not always be characterized simply by a hierarchical process of clonal evolution, but may also involve clonal succession of malignant cells. Moreover, the deletion of M-bcr in recurrent BC suggests that bcr/abl may not be essential for the maintenance of cell growth in established BC.","['Laneuville, P', 'Sullivan, A K']","['Laneuville P', 'Sullivan AK']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recurrence']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Sep;5(9):752-6.,"['abl', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 54 cases and a review of the literature.,744-51,"Fifty-four unselected acute non-lymphocytic leukemias (ANLL) were analyzed for their immunophenotype, especially the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), as well as for rearrangements and/or deletions in the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH), Ig kappa, Ig lambda, T-cell receptor (TcR)-beta, TcR-gamma and TcR-delta/alpha genes. In 15% (8/54) of the ANLL patients one or more genes were rearranged. This especially concerned IgH gene rearrangements (seven cases) and to a lesser extent rearrangements of Ig kappa genes (one case), TcR-beta genes (three cases), TcR-gamma genes (two cases) and TcR-delta genes (two cases). Combined results from this study and from literature data on 378 unselected ANLL revealed that IgH gene rearrangements occurred in 14% of ANLL and Ig kappa gene rearrangements in 2% of ANLL patients. Rearrangements of Ig lambda genes have never been reported. Rearrangements of TcR-beta genes, TcR-gamma genes and TcR-delta genes have been found in 7, 5, and 9% of ANLL, respectively. In this study it was not possible to demonstrate an association between the presence of a TdT+ leukemic subpopulation and the occurrence of cross-lineage Ig or TcR gene rearrangements in ANLL. These rearrangements were detected in 13% (5/38) of ANLL with a TdT+ leukemic subpopulation and in 19% (3/16) of TdT- ANLL. Review of these data and over 400 published ANLL cases in which at least two different Ig and/or TcR genes had been investigated revealed that cross-lineage rearrangements of these genes concur frequently. Ig kappa gene rearrangements were only found in ANLL with rearranged IgH genes, whereas TcR-beta genes and TcR-gamma genes were only rearranged in combination with rearranged TcR-delta genes and/or IgH genes. Based on these data, an ordered pattern of cross-lineage Ig and TcR gene rearrangements in ANLL can be postulated, in which rearrangements of IgH genes or TcR-delta genes precede the other cross-lineage rearrangements.","['Adriaansen, H J', 'Soeting, P W', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Adriaansen HJ', 'Soeting PW', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Sep;5(9):744-51.,,,,,,,50,,,,,,,,,

Populations of hyperdiploid cells with double the near haploid number were observed in six of the patients, one of whom demonstrated further clonal evolution, and it is proposed that some cases classified as hyperdiploid ALL with greater than 50 chromosomes may also have arisen from a near haploid stem line.","['Gibbons, B', 'MacCallum, P', 'Watts, E', 'Rohatiner, A Z', 'Webb, D', 'Katz, F E', 'Secker-Walker, L M', 'Temperley, I J', 'Harrison, C J', 'Campbell, R H']","['Gibbons B', 'MacCallum P', 'Watts E', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Webb D', 'Katz FE', 'Secker-Walker LM', 'Temperley IJ', 'Harrison CJ', 'Campbell RH', 'et al.']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Sep;5(9):738-43.,,,,,,,23,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that this translocation activates a proto-oncogene designated BCL1. In an effort to better understand the mechanism by which this translocation leads to malignancy, we have studied this translocation in two human cell lines. MO1094 and MO2058 were derived from patients with prolymphocytic variants of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Southern blotting of the MO2058 cell line documented that the translocation linked the Jh region in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene to the previously described BCL1 major translocation cluster (MTC). Using the polymerase chain reaction, we cloned this translocation and showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint was within 7 bp of two other samples reported previously. Southern blotting of the MO1094 cell line suggested that the translocation in this cell line might link Jh sequences to a new region in the BCL1 locus on chromosome 11. Therefore, the MO1094 breakpoint was cloned from a genomic library. Comparison with normal cloned DNA from the BCL1 locus showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint occurred 24 kb telomeric of the MTC. This work reinforces the concept that translocation breakpoints in the BCL1 locus are scattered over at least 63 kb.","['Meeker, T C', 'Sellers, W', 'Harvey, R', 'Withers, D', 'Carey, K', 'Xiao, H', 'Block, A M', 'Dadey, B', 'Han, T']","['Meeker TC', 'Sellers W', 'Harvey R', 'Withers D', 'Carey K', 'Xiao H', 'Block AM', 'Dadey B', 'Han T']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Sep;5(9):733-7.,,,['CA 01102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferative effects are exerted on the level of the multipotent as well as the unipotent progenitor cell. Functional effects on mature phagocytes comprise bactericidal and tumoricidal mechanisms including induction of cytokine release. GM-CSF receptors are present on normal hematopoietic progenitors as well as on mature granulocytes, on leukemic cells and some non-hematopoietic cells. Alteration of the GM-CSF gene has been associated with distinct features of AML and ALL. The glycosilated molecule is produced by various hemolymphopoietic and possibly non-hematopoietic cells, amongst whom T-lymphocytes and marrow stroma may be most relevant for myelopoiesis. The regulation of gene expression is exerted on both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels of gene expression. GM-CSF production may play a role in steady state as well as in stress hematopoiesis. In vivo application of GM-CSF leads to a marked increase of phagocytes, in particular granulocytes. GM-CSF reduces the duration of neutropenia following aplasiogenic and ablative therapy. GM-CSF may possibly be helpful in the treatment of victims of radiation accidents and in patients with acquired neutropenias and glykogenosis IB.

COALL study group].,231-5,"Prognostic factors to estimate the risk of relapse are crucial for risk-adapted therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a cooperative multicenter treatment study for childhood ALL (COALL-03-85) the prognostic relevance of the bone marrow (BM) blast count at day 28 was evaluated. Treatment was adjusted to the initial risk factors; patients with high risk (white blood count (WBC) greater than or equal to 25/nl, age greater than or equal to 10 years, T- or NULL-ALL) received intensified therapy consisting of rotation of 6 non cross-resistant drug combinations with 12 different agents. After 4 weeks 289/305 (94.8%) children were in complete remission (CR); one child died of infection, and 15 (14 high-risk patients) still had more than 5% blasts in the BM. Twelve of these 15 patients were in remission after 2 to 4 weeks additional treatment. Poor responders often had a high initial WBC, age above 10 years of T- or NULL-ALL. In spite of continuation of intensive therapy all children with more than 10% blasts in the BM on day 28 suffered an early relapse except 2 who were transplanted in first remission. Event-free survival for the poor responders is 0.15 compared to 0.71 (p = 0.0001) for the good responders (median observation time 48 months). In multivariate analysis remission status on day 28 was the only significant prognostic factor in high-risk patients above one year of age; traditional risk factors as initial WBC, age above 10 years, hepatosplenomegaly, and immunological subtype were of no prognostic significance in this study.

At onset, the bone marrow was hypercellular and 77% of the cells were blasts, mainly lymphoblast-like cells and cytogenetic study demonstrated 45, XY, -7 in all blasts. Cytochemically most of those blasts were negative for peroxidase, sudan black B, alpha-NB esterase staining. The immunological phenotype was J5 (CD10)+, I2 (HLA-DR)+, SmIg-, CyIgmu-, Leu1 (CD5)-, OKT11 (CD2)-, MY7 (CD13)-, suggesting common ALL. Eight months later, the bone marrow cells were occupied with large sized blasts which were almost positive for peroxidase stain and the cells showed coexpression of Mo1 (CD11b)+, MY4 (CD14)+, MY7+, MY9 (CD33)+, MCS2 (CD13)+, I2+, J5-, B4 (CD19)-, Mo2 (CDw14)-, at relapse. He died 2 years and 6 months after his initial diagnosis. An autopsy was performed which revealed generalized infiltration of leukemic cells and aspergillosis of the lung. In general, monosomy 7 is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome in childhood, and is terminated to acute myeloblastic leukemia. In this case, bone marrow blasts demonstrated monosomy 7 cytogenetically, and this case was considered as an acute mixed lineage leukemia of bilineal type. And this case proved that a monosomy 7 can also be terminated to acute mixed lineage leukemia with both lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes.","['Kawakami, K', 'Kitahara, T', 'Nakazono, S', 'Takezaki, T']","['Kawakami K', 'Kitahara T', 'Nakazono S', 'Takezaki T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,,"['Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Monosomy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1991 Aug;32(8):862-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of HTLV-II Rex to interact directly with the HTLV-II splice donor site suggests that HTLV-II Rex may increase expression of unspliced gag-pol mRNA, in part, by inhibiting splicing.","['Black, A C', 'Ruland, C T', 'Yip, M T', 'Luo, J', 'Tran, B', 'Kalsi, A', 'Quan, E', 'Aboud, M', 'Chen, I S', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Black AC', 'Ruland CT', 'Yip MT', 'Luo J', 'Tran B', 'Kalsi A', 'Quan E', 'Aboud M', 'Chen IS', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.12.6645-6653.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Dec;65(12):6645-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.12.6645-6653.1991.,,PMC250733,"['CA 01314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 01566-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 53632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Abelson virus strains encoding proteins missing portions of this region have a reduced ability to transform lymphoid cells in vitro and in vivo. One such strain, called P90A, is unique in that P90A-injected mice almost always develop tumors containing highly oncogenic variants that encode new forms of Abelson protein. In this work, we have examined the mechanism by which these variants are generated and used the variants to identify carboxyl-terminal protein sequences important for the induction of Abelson disease. Analysis of mice injected with helper-free P90A virus stocks demonstrates that the variants are generated during viral replication in vivo, probably as a consequence of error-prone reverse transcription. The sequence of the P90A viral genome reveals that a 19-base deletion is responsible for synthesis of the truncated Abelson protein. As a consequence of this mutation, 167 carboxyl-terminal amino acids normally found in the wild-type protein have been replaced by 33 amino acids derived from an alternative reading frame. Site-directed mutants show that the combination of the deletion and the P90A carboxyl terminus is required for the generation of variants. Thus, the particular structure of the P90A protein, not the specific residues lost or gained, alters the transforming potential of the Abelson protein. Finally, the sequence of the variants encoding smaller Abelson proteins reveals that as few as 452 v-abl-encoded amino acids are required for rapid induction of Abelson disease.","['Parmar, K', 'Huebner, R C', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Parmar K', 'Huebner RC', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.12.6478-6485.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Dec;65(12):6478-85. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.12.6478-6485.1991.,,PMC250691,['CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This regimen did not significantly affect the immune response of infected mice assessed in terms of delayed hypersensitivity (ear thickness) and the hemagglutination assay. In contrast, a single challenge with a large dose of morphine (up to 300 mg/kg), which is not lethal in noninfected mice, increased mortality markedly (up to 100%) in infected mice when administered at day 14 or 21 postinfection. Repeated i.p. injections with pentazocine (50 mg/kg b.i.d. for 5 days before infection, followed by 30 mg/kg for 14 days postinfection) had no influence on mortality or immune responses in infected mice; similar results were obtained with a single high-dose injection (up to 100 mg/kg). Lastly, repeated i.p. injections of cocaine, using the same experimental procedure as that for pentazocine, decreased immune responsiveness and slightly increased mortality, whereas a single injection was devoid of lethal effect.

These particular abilities are tested in a group of 43 ALL survivors, with comparisons against solid tumor as well as sibling controls. The results indicate that four cognitive processes are affected by CNS prophylaxis for ALL: short-term memory, speed of processing, visuomotor coordination, and sequencing ability. Younger children have a more severe speed of processing deficit and children treated with a less rigorous protocol appear to be slightly less affected generally. The specific cognitive deficits found are related to neurological evidence on both theoretical and empirical grounds.

Although previous reports had suggested that the sulfhydryl-containing compound mesna might be superior to forced diuresis in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis, there were concerns about the effect of mesna on engraftment in these studies. To address these concerns, 100 patients were randomized to receive mesna or forced saline diuresis while undergoing bone marrow transplant conditioning with regimens that included high-dose cyclophosphamide. To try to minimize the likelihood of graft rejection, patients who were being transplanted with cyclophosphamide as a sole agent were excluded from the study. After randomization and administration of therapy, patients were monitored by microscopic and dip-stick urinalyses; they were also followed for effects of therapy on engraftment. The incidence of consistent or severe hematuria was 33% in the mesna arm and 20% in the hyperhydration arm (P = .31). Severe bleeding occurred in 12.5% of mesna patients and 7.5% of hyperhydration patients (P = .71). No unexpected toxicities were encountered, and engraftment times did not differ.

We report the results of further studies designed to investigate the ability of GM-CSF, erythropoietin, interleukin-1, and lithium to modulate AZT toxicity on murine hematopoietic granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), megakaryocytic (CFU-Meg), and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors cultured from bone marrow and spleen cells from mice infected with RLV. Hematopoietic progenitors from either normal or RLV-infected animals when exposed to AZT demonstrated concentration-dependent toxicity and differed for each progenitor with BFU-E being the most sensitive (ID50 concentration, 5 x 10(-9) M) and CFU-GM the least sensitive (ID50 concentration, 5 x 10(-5) M). As has been previously demonstrated using normal murine hematopoietic progenitors, when cultured with RLV-infected marrow or spleen cells, addition of GM-CSF, Meg-CSF or erythropoietin failed to inhibit AZT toxicity in vitro on CFU-GM, CFU-Meg, and BFU-E, respectively. However, in the presence of interleukin-1 (recombinant human IL-1 alpha, 30 ngm) or lithium chloride (ultra-pure, 1.0 mM), AZT toxicity CFU-GM, CFU-Meg, and BFU-E cultured from RLV-infected marrow or spleen cells was reduced. These results further demonstrate interleukin-1 and lithium are effective in modulating the toxic action of AZT on hematopoietic progenitors and that RLV-infected animals serve as a useful viral model system to study the effect of agents capable of modulating hematopoiesis in the presence of the anti-viral drug AZT.","['Gallicchio, V S', 'Hughes, N K', 'Hulette, B C', 'Noblitt, L']","['Gallicchio VS', 'Hughes NK', 'Hulette BC', 'Noblitt L']","['Department of Medicine, Lucille P.

In the present study we have investigated some of the possible mechanisms involved in the regulation of HILDA/LIF gene expression in activated human monocytes and compared them to those of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and IL-1 beta gene expression. In the absence of added stimuli HILDA/LIF mRNA was barely detectable in isolated monocytes. HILDA/LIF mRNA accumulation was weakly induced by stimuli such as LPS or phorbol ester. However, a synergy was observed when each stimulus was used in combination with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Nuclear run-on analysis did not detect an increase in HILDA/LIF gene transcription upon stimulation with LPS or phorbol ester in combination with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. HILDA/LIF mRNA half-life showed an increase when phorbol ester and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were used in combination over that obtained for each stimuli alone. HILDA/LIF mRNA expression was largely inhibited when monocytes were stimulated in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) added either at the onset or 4 h after the beginning of the stimulation period. When CHX was added at later time points, 2 h before cell harvesting, HILDA/LIF mRNA levels were superinduced when compared with those in cells stimulated in the absence of CHX. This superinduction can be at least partially explained by post-transcriptional mechanisms, since HILDA/LIF mRNA half-life in CHX-superinduced cells was significantly increased when compared with values on stimulated CHX-untreated cells. In contrast to HILDA/LIF, G-CSF and IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation showed a different response pattern to the same stimuli, and a augmentation of their gene transcription was detected by the run-on technique in activated monocytic cells when compared with controls. Furthermore, G-CSF and Il-1 beta mRNA levels were superinduced in monocytes stimulated in the presence of CHX from the onset of the stimulation period. These studies indicate that, when compared to G-CSF and IL-1 beta, the expression of HILDA/LIF gene is under the control of relatively specific regulatory mechanisms. HILDA/LIF gene expression is controlled by newly synthesized proteins acting at early and late time points of the stimulation period and with opposite effects on HILDA/LIF mRNA levels. Finally, HILDA/LIF mRNA levels are regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms of mRNA stabilization probably controlled through labile newly synthesized proteins.","['Anegon, I', 'Grolleau, D', 'Soulillou, J P']","['Anegon I', 'Grolleau D', 'Soulillou JP']","['INSERM U211, Plateau Technique CHU, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Dec 1;147(11):3973-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon priming in vivo and repetitive stimulation in vitro with HTLV-I+ syngeneic T cells, HTLV-I-specific CD8+ CTL were demonstrated in LEW and F344 rat spleen cell cultures. Interestingly, these CTL were directed against HTLV-I env and pX gene products. Immunization of LEW and WKA rats with the env and gag gene-expressing rVV, respectively, resulted in generation of HTLV-I-specific CD8+ CTL. However, a pX-gene expressing rVV failed to prime either rat strain. In addition, HTLV-I-specific CD8+ CTL from F1 hybrid (WKA x LEW) rats generated by immunization and restimulation with HTLV-I+ syngeneic T cells showed gag and pX Ag specificity on WKA rat cells and env and pX Ag specificity on LEW rat cells. These results suggest that immunogenicity of HTLV-I gag and env Ag in induction of HTLV-I-specific CTL varies depending on MHC, and that the pX Ag expressed by rVV is not a potent immunogen for rats.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Isobe, A', 'Masuda, M', 'Tozawa, H', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Shida, H']","['Tanaka Y', 'Isobe A', 'Masuda M', 'Tozawa H', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Yamamoto N', 'Shida H']","['Department of Immunology, School of Hygienic Sciences, Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vaccinia virus']",1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Nov 15;147(10):3646-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell death occurs as a consequence of colloid osmotic lysis. In the present investigation early leukotoxin-induced changes in membrane permeability were studied by flow cytometry and quantitative spectrofluorimetry in leukotoxin-susceptible and resistant targets. Within 5 s toxin-susceptible cells exhibited concentration-dependent, sustained increases in systolic free Ca2+, and this was rapidly followed by a progressive fall in membrane potential. These early manifestations of membrane injury occurred approximately 10-15 min before cell death, as reflected by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide stained cells. The rise in cytosolic Ca2+ was almost entirely due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. The results of Hill plots for the action of leukotoxin on Ca2+ permeability in human neutrophils or HL-60 cells suggested that two or more toxin molecules participate in the assembly of an ion conducting pore in the plasma membrane. Changes in membrane permeability or cell viability were not observed in response to heat-inactivated toxin. Under appropriate conditions toxin-induced membrane abnormalities were inhibited by leukotoxin-neutralizing mAb or relatively high concentrations (greater than or equal to 2.5 mM) of extracellular Ca2+. Leukotoxin-resistant target cells showed no evidence of membrane injury even when exposed to high concentrations of leukotoxin for prolonged periods of time. These included resistant human K562 erythroleukemia cells and murine SP2 myeloma cells which have previously been shown to adsorb the toxin, suggesting that they possess a protective mechanism(s) which impedes toxin insertion or assembly in the lipid bilayer. These data support the concept that A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin acts as a cell-specific, pore-forming protein which permeabilizes the plasma membrane of susceptible target cells.","['Taichman, N S', 'Iwase, M', 'Lally, E T', 'Shattil, S J', 'Cunningham, M E', 'Korchak, H M']","['Taichman NS', 'Iwase M', 'Lally ET', 'Shattil SJ', 'Cunningham ME', 'Korchak HM']","['University of Pennsylvania, School of Dental Medicine, Department of Pathology, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antitoxins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (leukotoxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans/*pathogenicity', 'Antitoxins/immunology', 'Bacterial Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cytosol/physiology', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/*drug effects', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Nov 15;147(10):3587-94.,,,"['DE 07118/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 08239/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 09517/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The examination of wettability of the copolymer surfaces showed that the contact angle of water on the hydrophobic surfaces is an increasing linear function of styrene content in the copolymer. Cell adhesion to the unwettable surfaces is low (within 2-4%). A novel method of modification of the styrene copolymer surfaces was used to render these surfaces suitable for cell attachment. The modification consists of sulfonation of the surfaces with sulfur trioxide at the gas/solid interface. The contact angle of sulfonated copolymer surfaces is a decreasing linear function of styrene content in the copolymer. The contact angle decreases due to the increased number of highly hydrophilic sulfonic groups bonded to styrene. By acetylation of the sulfonated surfaces it was shown that cell adhesion to acetylated surfaces is not diminished and is at the same level as cell adhesion to sulfonated copolymer surfaces. Thus, it can be concluded that sulfonation of copolymer surfaces does not form hydroxyl groups. Cell adhesion to substrata of high wettability stabilizes after 30s. The relative number of cells adhering to the sulfonated copolymer surfaces is a decreasing linear function of the contact angle. For the copolymer surfaces containing 50% of styrene units the contact angle decreases sevenfold, due to sulfonation, and the number of adhering cells increases 40-fold. The results obtained show that for cell-substratum adhesive interaction the presence of sulfonic groups at the substratum surface is important.","['Kowalczynska, H M', 'Kaminski, J']","['Kowalczynska HM', 'Kaminski J']","['Department of Biophysics and Biomathematics, Medical Center of Postgraduate Education, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '9003-53-6 (styrofoam)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Culture Media', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Polystyrenes', 'Sulfonic Acids', 'Surface Properties']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1991 Jul;99 ( Pt 3):587-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work demonstrates that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibits TPA-induced increases in c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels in U-937 leukemia cells. These findings were associated with a block in appearance of the monocytic phenotype, including inhibition of TPA-induced increases in lamin A, lamin C, and vimentin transcripts. Other studies have demonstrated that TPA-induced monocytic differentiation and expression of the c-jun and c-fos genes in myeloid leukemia cells are regulated by protein kinase C (PKC). The finding that dexamethasone has no effect on TPA-induced activation of PKC suggests that this glucocorticoid inhibits signals downstream or parallel to this enzyme. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that: (1) induction of c-jun and c-fos expression by TPA is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms, (2) TPA-induced expression of c-jun and c-fos does not require protein synthesis, and (3) TPA-induced expression of both genes is inhibited at the transcriptional level by dexamethasone. To further define the effects of dexamethasone at the molecular level, we prepared a series of deleted c-jun promoter fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Increases in CAT activity during transient expression of these constructs in TPA-treated U-937 cells could be assigned to the region (-97 to -20) of the promoter that contains the AP-1 binding site. This induction of CAT activity was sensitive to dexamethasone. These findings suggest that dexamethasone down-regulates TPA-induced transcription of the c-jun gene during monocytic differentiation by inhibiting activation of the AP-1 site.","['Hass, R', 'Brach, M', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Giese, G', 'Traub, P', 'Kufe, D']","['Hass R', 'Brach M', 'Kharbanda S', 'Giese G', 'Traub P', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', '*Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041490116 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Oct;149(1):125-31. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041490116.,"['c-fos', 'c-jun']",,['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein undergoes major changes in its state of phosphorylation upon induction of differentiation of leukemic cells in culture. The same protein appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes that include regulation of hormone secretion, T cell activation, muscle differentiation, and brain development. In this report, we describe our studies of the regulation of expression of this gene in leukemic cells. We show that the expression of this gene is markedly reduced upon induction of differentiation of a variety of leukemic cells in culture. We use a cDNA clone that we constructed earlier which encodes this protein as a probe to isolate the human chromosomal p18 gene. We characterize the 5' end of this gene in detail and identify its promoter element. We also identify a regulatory element in the first intervening sequence (IVS-1) of this gene which loses its DNase I hypersensitivity upon induction of differentiation of leukemic cells in culture. Our DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrate nuclear protein binding to multiple sequence motifs within its promoter element and its IVS-1 regulatory element. Functional studies using a transient expression system show that deletion of these sequence motifs has profound effects on the expression of this gene. These studies begin to shed some light on the mechanism of regulation of a gene that may be involved in control of cell growth and differentiation and in a variety of other vital cellular processes.","['Luo, X N', 'Arcasoy, M O', 'Brickner, H E', 'Mistry, S', 'Schechter, A D', 'Atweh, G F']","['Luo XN', 'Arcasoy MO', 'Brickner HE', 'Mistry S', 'Schechter AD', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Health Science Center, Brooklyn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Introns', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/11/05 00:00,1991/11/05 00:01,['1991/11/05 00:00'],"['1991/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)54811-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Nov 5;266(31):21004-10.,,,"['HL-16008/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/M74239', 'GENBANK/S61326', 'GENBANK/S61330', 'GENBANK/S61332', 'GENBANK/S61335', 'GENBANK/S61337', 'GENBANK/S61340', 'GENBANK/S61342', 'GENBANK/S61344', 'GENBANK/S65030', 'GENBANK/S65043']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hodgkin's disease and follicular lymphomas are relatively rare in Asia. Among NHL, the Asians have a higher rate of aggressive NHL, as compared with the NCI data. Immunologic analysis revealed that PTCL is common in Asia. The relative frequency of PTCL is comparable among Chinese in Taiwan, the east coast of China, and Hong Kong, as well as in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) nonendemic areas in Japan. The increased rate of T-cell lymphomas in Asia is attributed to the low incidence of follicular lymphomas. The similar patterns of distribution in histopathologic and immunologic subtypes of NHL in Asia suggest that a common ethnic or geographic factor exists. To elucidate it, further detailed epidemiologic studies are needed. Primary extranodal NHL is slightly more prevalent in Asia than in the United States; the most frequent primary site is Waldeyer's ring in Japanese patients and the GI tract in Chinese patients. Primary small intestinal lymphoma in Asia showed the pattern of the Western type. Primary cutaneous lymphomas are rare in Asia. The clinical features of PTCL in Asia are comparable with those described in the United States, except for a predilection for the nasal/paranasal region. In Asia, outside Japan, ATLL has been reported only in Taiwan. The seroepidemiologic survey of carriers of ATLL showed the rate of seropositivity for HTLV-I in Taiwan was similar to that in nonendemic areas in Japan. The clinicopathologic features of ATLL in Taiwan and Japan are essentially identical. In children in Japan and Taiwan, Hodgkin's disease is much less frequent than in the West. However, the relative frequencies of the histopathologic and immunologic subtypes of childhood NHL in Japan and Taiwan do not differ significantly from those of the West.

The B-cell NHLs phenotypically correspond to normal cells in the mid stages of normal differentiation. More specifically, by their expression of B-cell activation antigens, these tumors are the neoplastic counterparts of normal activated B cells. The follicular lymphomas--including the small cleaved, mixed small and large cell, and large cell types, as well as the small noncleaved cell (Burkitt's) lymphomas--represent malignant expansions of normal germinal center B cells by their expression of pan-B cell antigens, B-cell activation antigens, and CD10 (CALLA). The diffuse lymphomas also correspond to normal activated B cells. The small lymphocytic lymphomas express the low-affinity IL-2 receptor and CD5, both of which are induced on normal B cells following mitogen stimulation. The other diffuse B-cell NHLs similarly express activation antigens and resemble ""transformed"" B cells. The T-cell NHLs generally correspond to normal activated CD4+ T cells. These tumors--which include most peripheral T-cell lymphomas, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemias/lymphomas--express antigens induced on activated T cells, including IL-2 and transferrin receptors (CD25 and CD71, respectively), as well as HLA-DR. The lymphoblastic lymphomas, which are generally of T-cell lineage, phenotypically correspond to stages of intrathymic differentiation, often by their coexpression of CD4 and CD8, as well as expression of CD1. It remains controversial whether the immunophenotype of lymphoblastic lymphoma differs significantly from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Since immunologic heterogeneity of NHL was first observed, attempts have been made to employ the data as a prognostic variable. Early studies suggested that lineage derivation or expression of markers of proliferating cells affected outcome in NHL. However, these reports were often retrospective, included various histologies, and did not treat patients uniformly. More recent prospective studies with relatively uniformly treated patients, predominantly involving DLCL, suggest that certain immunologically defined subgroups may have significantly different clinical outcomes.

However, isotretinoin does not potentiate the antileukemic effects of VCR, DNR and 6-TG against leukemic cells obtained from patients with ALL.","['Pieters, R', 'Huismans, D R', 'Loonen, A H', 'Hahlen, K', 'Veerman, A J']","['Pieters R', 'Huismans DR', 'Loonen AH', 'Hahlen K', 'Veerman AJ']","['Free University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Vitamin A/*pharmacology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01942.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1991 Sep;82(9):1051-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01942.x.,,PMC5918603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential disadvantages of elective pelvic irradiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease include compromise of future tolerance of chemotherapy in the event of treatment failure, and infertility. Gonadal function was assessed in 67 patients less than 35 years old at the time of treatment. Compromise of gonadal function was correlated with the lack of special testicular shielding during pelvic irradiation and chemotherapy in the male, and with no oophoropexy before pelvic irradiation in the female. Twelve of 26 patients with recurrence after either less than MTNI or MTNI, with or without chemotherapy, were alive and without evidence of disease at greater than 2 years after completing salvage therapy, compared with 7 of 11 patients with recurrence after TNI.","['Mendenhall, N P', 'Taylor, B W Jr', 'Marcus, R B Jr', 'Million, R R']","['Mendenhall NP', 'Taylor BW Jr', 'Marcus RB Jr', 'Million RR']","['Dept. of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gonads/radiation effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lymph Nodes/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Pelvic Neoplasms', 'Pelvis/*radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1991/10/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/10/11 19:15'],"['1991/10/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/10/11 19:15 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(91)90271-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(91)90271-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Oct;21(5):1157-65. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(91)90271-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cytotoxins are, respectively, 1,023 and 953 amino acids in length and are encoded by genes within identically organized operons. They share 45% amino acid sequence identities but differ in their target cell specificities. In vitro-derived recombinant hybrid genes between hlyA and lktA were constructed by using restriction endonuclease sites created by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The cytolytic activity of hybrid proteins was investigated using as targets sheep erythrocytes and two cultured cell lines from different species (BL3, bovine leukemia-derived B lymphocytes; and Raji, human B-cell lymphoma cells). HlyA is cytolytic to all three cell types. LktA lyses only BL3 cells. Among the hybrid proteins displaying cytolytic activity, the striking finding is that the hemolytic activity of several LktA-HlyA hybrids was independent of any cytolytic activity against either cultured cell species. The hemolytic activity was associated with the HlyA region between amino acids 564 and 739. Structures that are critical for HlyA cytolytic activity against BL3 or Raji cells were destroyed when LktA-HlyA and HlyA-LktA hybrids were made, respectively, at amino acid positions 564 and 739 of HlyA. In contrast to HlyA, which lysed the two different cultured cell lines with equal efficiency, Lkt-HlyA hybrids possessing the amino-terminal 169 residues of LktA lysed BL3 cells more efficiently than Raji cells.

PKC was cytosolic in long-term PMA-treated and control RBL cells and its translocation occurred regardless of the total PKC cell content, showing a possible correlation between the level of functional PKC (susceptible to be translocated) and exocytosis.

METHODS: Seven CML patients in blast crisis (four lymphoid and three myeloid) who obtained a complete clinical remission after an intensive polychemotherapy treatment were evaluated by cytogenetic and molecular analysis both in blast and remission phases. Standard cytogenetic and Southern techniques were employed; in addition, minimal residual disease status (MRD) was ascertained by amplification (PCR) of the specific bcr-abl chimeric transcripts. RESULTS: After a single cycle of induction, all lymphoid cases displayed a complete restoration of Ph1-negative hemopoiesis; by contrast, one myeloid blast crisis showed a partial suppression of Ph1-positive hemopoiesis only after two cycles of chemotherapy, and in the remaining two cases the hematological remission was indeed a reversion to the chronic phase. CONCLUSIONS: Ph1-positive chronic clones present in lymphoid blast crisis showed a higher degree of sensitivity to intensive chemotherapy than those present in the myeloid cases. This observation further suggests that the growth properties of the Ph1-positive clones are highly variable from case to case and probably tend to progress during the time-course of the disease.","['Guerrasio, A', 'Martinelli, G', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Falda, M', 'Paolino, F', 'Rege-Cambrin, G', 'Rosso, C', 'Pignatti, P F', 'Gasparini, P', 'Perona, G']","['Guerrasio A', 'Martinelli G', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Falda M', 'Paolino F', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Rosso C', 'Pignatti PF', 'Gasparini P', 'Perona G', 'et al.']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Mar-Apr;76(2):126-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Serum and urine concentrations of CP were determined in 19 patients who received 2 or more high doses of CP before bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: Urinary recovery ranged between 1% and 32% and was essentially the same after the first and the second CP dose. In contrast, the pattern of disappearance from the serum of the two doses of CP was substantially different. The serum half-life of the first dose varied over a wide range (4.4 to 25.0 h, mean 8.7 +/- 4.6 h), while the half-life of the second dose was always shorter (1.7 to 6.0 h, mean 3.6 +/- 0.9 h). Accordingly, the CP area under the curve (AUC) of the first dose was much more variable and was always much higher than the CP AUC of the second dose. Therefore, prior administration of CP resulted in a very significant increase of CP metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These differences can be relevant to the outcome of treatment, and suggest that the metabolism of CP can be manipulated and can be made more homogeneous, either by giving a priming dose of CP (leading to a lower CP AUC, to a faster conversion into activated metabolites and to the exposure of host cells to a higher concentration of the metabolites for a shorter time) or by giving the drug as a continuous infusion over a longer time, to obtain the opposite results.","['Fasola, G', 'Lo Greco, P', 'Calori, E', 'Zilli, M', 'Verlicchi, F', 'Motta, M R', 'Ricci, P', 'Baccarani, M', 'Tura, S']","['Fasola G', 'Lo Greco P', 'Calori E', 'Zilli M', 'Verlicchi F', 'Motta MR', 'Ricci P', 'Baccarani M', 'Tura S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/surgery', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/surgery', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism/surgery']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Mar-Apr;76(2):120-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively evaluated in a series of 342 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In univariate analysis, survival was significantly influenced (p less than 0.01) by traditional prognostic factors: number of lymphoid areas involved, volume of adenopathies, presence and degree of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral blood lymphocytosis (greater than 60 x 10(9)/l), percentage of bone marrow lymphocytes (greater than 50%). Among variables not included in the traditional staging systems, age over 70, hypoproteinemia (less than 6 gr/dl) and hypoalbuminemia (less than 3.5 gr/dl) adversely affected prognosis. All the most widely adopted staging systems recognize no more than three groups of patients with statistically different outcomes. In multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of serum albumin was independent of both age and the group of variables included in each staging system considered. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that evaluation of the serum albumin level could be useful, in future multicenter studies, for further implementation of the staging of CLL.","['Levis, A', 'Ficara, F', 'Marmont, F', 'De Crescenzo, A', 'Resegotti, L']","['Levis A', 'Ficara F', 'Marmont F', 'De Crescenzo A', 'Resegotti L']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Maggiore di San Giovanni Battista e della Citta di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serum Albumin/*analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Mar-Apr;76(2):113-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigate the relationship of opening and shutting to recombination in two ways. First, we have tested a series of substrates containing one or two joining signals in an in vivo assay. Opening and shutting can be readily observed in substrates that have only one consensus joining signal. Thus, unlike recombination, the majority of open and shut events do not require interactions between two canonical joining signals. Next we examined two-signal substrates to investigate the effect of signal proximity on the frequency of dual open and shut events. These experiments indicate that at least some of the time opening and shutting can be a two-signal transaction. Together these results point to two mechanistically related, but distinct origins for open and shut joining events. In one case, cutting and closing may occur without interaction between two signals. In the other, we suggest that interaction of a canonical signal with 'cryptic' signal-like elements whose sequence is extensively diverged from canonical signals, may bias the V(D)J recombination machinery towards opening and shutting rather than recombination. Open and shut operations could in this way provide a means whereby mistakes in target recognition by the V(D)J recombination machinery produce a non-recombinant outcome, avoiding deleterious chromosomal rearrangements in lymphoid tissues.","['Lewis, S M', 'Hesse, J E']","['Lewis SM', 'Hesse JE']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1991 Dec;10(12):3631-9.,,PMC453094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, even within a single system, LIF can display totally different effects, i.e. induction of differentiation of one leukemic cell line vs. stimulation of proliferation of another. The corollary to these observations is that there appears to be many parallels in developmental systems. For instance, in the case of neuronal ""lineage commitment,"" the events that relate to migration of neural crest cells along various pathways and their ultimate arrest in different locales demonstrate sufficient analogies to hematopoietic lineage commitment phenomena that, in a provocative review, Anderson coined the term ""neuropoiesis"". This type of analogy becomes even more intriguing when one realizes that some of the same molecules are regulating neuronal and hematopoietic ""lineage"" proliferation and differentiation. In this respect, several interleukins in addition to LIF are important in neuronal development, and nerve growth factor turns out to also be a hematopoietic regulatory molecule. Similar parallels are enacted in other organ systems as well. The mediation of identical effects by distinct cytokines bound to unique receptors could conceivably be explained by receptor transmodulation or by overlapping signaling sequences. It is nevertheless also unclear how a single cytokine attached to a single receptor can accomplish varied and opposing effects, although divergent intracellular signaling mechanisms could account for some of these phenomena. Yet another enigma relates to how cells from one system can be properly influenced by a pleiotropic molecule such as LIF without significant ""cross-effects"" on other potentially responsive systems. Cytokine production that is restricted to certain developmental stages, or very localized distribution and spheres of influence within a microenvironment, could be explanatory. The findings of Rathjan and colleagues, i.e. that LIF exists as both a diffusible molecule and as a molecule incorporated into the extracellular matrix, is of special interest in relation to the above questions. Indeed, the distinctions between the roles of diffusible and immobilized signaling molecules could be crucial to the multiplicity of LIF's actions. Diffusible regulatory factors allow communication between spatially separated cells. Cellular responsiveness to such factors is dictated by the presence of appropriate receptors and postreceptor machinery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kurzrock, R', 'Estrov, Z', 'Wetzler, M', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Estrov Z', 'Wetzler M', 'Gutterman JU', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson, Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Endocr Rev,Endocrine reviews,8006258,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Nervous System/growth & development']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/edrv-12-3-208 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr Rev. 1991 Aug;12(3):208-17. doi: 10.1210/edrv-12-3-208.,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,

To explore this relationship further, we have now examined the expression of H- and M-type LDH isoenzymes immunocytochemically in human resting and mitogen-activated B and T lymphocytes. In the resting state, T lymphocytes showed strong staining for H-type LDH but showed little or no staining for M-type LDH, while B lymphocytes showed only weak staining for M-type LDH. During activation of T cells, M-type LDH started to increase when cells entered the early stages of the cell cycle. The staining intensity increased to a maximum when the percentage of the T cells at the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle reached its peak. M-type LDH expression declined when the activated T cells returned to their resting state. Staining for H-type LDH remained strong in T cells during activation. In B lymphocytes, both H- and M-type LDH isoenzymes increased concomitantly following activation and the staining intensity also correlated well with the percentage of the S/G2/M fraction. The expression of H- and M-type LDH was also determined in fresh leukaemia and a variety of lymphoid cell lines. It was noted that cells of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and pro-lymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), morphologically similar to normal lymphocytes, showed a LDH staining pattern resembling that of resting B lymphocytes, while lymphoblasts in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), high grade B cell lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed cell lines showed a LDH staining pattern similar to that in activated T or B lymphocytes. Taken together, our results have demonstrated a significant correlation between expression of LDH and proliferative activity of cells.

Resting lymphocytes lack ADR activity and contain an intracellular inhibitory factor that suppresses DNA synthesis in normal but not transformed nuclei. In this study we describe a MOLT-4 subline that produces both the activator and inhibitory activities which can be separated by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The inhibitor is heat stable and inhibits ADR-mediated DNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. It does not inhibit DNA polymerase alpha activity. The inhibitor must be present at the initiation of DNA replication to be effective, as it loses most of its effectiveness if it is added after replication has begun. The presence of inhibitory activity in proliferating MOLT-4 cells, taken with the previous observation that inhibitor derived from normal resting cells does not affect DNA synthesis by MOLT-4 nuclei, suggests that failure of a down-regulating signal may play an important role in proliferative disorder.","['Coffman, F D', 'Fresa, K L', 'Oglesby, I', 'Cohen, S']","['Coffman FD', 'Fresa KL', 'Oglesby I', 'Cohen S']","['Department of Pathology, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,,"['DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(91)90162-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90162-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Dec;138(2):381-9. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90162-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments were designed to examine, by FACS analysis and by measurement of messenger RNA levels, the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of HLA-DR molecules. The expression of HLA-DR molecules induced by IFN-gamma was blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors sphingosine, staurosporine, and H7. H7 when added up to 20 hr after the initial stimulation with IFN-gamma prevented the further expression of HLA-DR. The general kinase inhibitors H8, H9, and HA1004, all less potent PKC inhibitors than H7, did not block the IFN-gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR at the concentrations employed. W7, a calmodulin antagonist, but not a PKC inhibitor, was also unable to prevent the IFN-gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR. Treatment of THP-1 with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a direct activator of PKC, alone or with Ca2+ ionophore A23187, was unable to induce HLA-DR expression. However, pretreatment with PMA for 24 hr prior to IFN-gamma stimulation decreased the IFN-gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR without decreasing IFN-gamma receptor levels. These results suggest that PKC plays a significant role in the IFN-gamma-induced signal transduction pathway leading to the expression of HLA-DR in cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage, and that PKC activity is required throughout the course of events leading to the actual expression of HLA-DR.","['Gumina, R J', 'Freire-Moar, J', 'DeYoung, L', 'Webb, D R', 'Devens, B H']","['Gumina RJ', 'Freire-Moar J', 'DeYoung L', 'Webb DR', 'Devens BH']","['Department of Inflammation Biology and Immunology, Syntex Research, U.S.A., Inc., Palo Alto, California 94304.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Second Messenger Systems/physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(91)90152-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90152-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Dec;138(2):265-79. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90152-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of ML-1 myeloblastic leukemia cells to nonlethal doses of the DNA damaging agents, gamma-irradiation or actinomycin D, causes a transient inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis via both G1 and G2 arrests. Levels of p53 protein in ML-1 cells and in proliferating normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells increase and decrease in temporal association with the G1 arrest. In contrast, the S-phase arrest of ML-1 cells caused by exposure to the anti-metabolite, cytosine arabinoside, which does not directly damage DNA, is not associated with a significant change in p53 protein levels. Caffeine treatment blocks both the G1 arrest and the induction of p53 protein after gamma-irradiation, thus suggesting that blocking the induction of p53 protein may contribute to the previously observed effects of caffeine on cell cycle changes after DNA damage. Unlike ML-1 cells and normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells, hematopoietic cells that either lack p53 gene expression or overexpress a mutant form of the p53 gene do not exhibit a G1 arrest after gamma-irradiation; however, the G2 arrest is unaffected by the status of the p53 gene. These results suggest a role for the wild-type p53 protein in the inhibition of DNA synthesis that follows DNA damage and thus suggest a new mechanism for how the loss of wild-type p53 might contribute to tumorigenesis.","['Kastan, M B', 'Onyekwere, O', 'Sidransky, D', 'Vogelstein, B', 'Craig, R W']","['Kastan MB', 'Onyekwere O', 'Sidransky D', 'Vogelstein B', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,['Cancer Res. 2016 Jul 1;76(13):3663-5.

A new filter-binding assay is described, which allows rapid quantification of nonprotein-linked DNA fragmentation involved in apoptosis. Both cell lines showed similar loss of colony formation ability following 30 min of treatment with various VM-26 concentrations even though the initial topoisomerase II-mediated DNA single-strand break frequency was higher in HL-60 cells. DNA repair studies following drug removal indicated that VM-26-induced DNA breaks reversed rapidly and completely in HT-29 cells, while in HL-60 cells, the initial lesions persisted at and above 5 microM VM-26. In both cell lines, topoisomerase II cleavage complexes, as measured by DNA-protein cross-links by alkaline elution, reversed rapidly and completely within 2-3 h. Secondary DNA fragmentation resembling chromatin endonucleolytic cleavage by apoptosis could be detected in HL-60 cells 3 h after VM-26 or etoposide treatment but not in HT-29 cells. Secondary DNA fragmentation was also induced in the human colon cancer cell lines COLO 320, which have c-myc amplification. Since HL-60 cells also have c-myc amplification and HT-29 do not, it is possible that c-myc overexpression may be involved in secondary DNA fragmentation. Finally, our results indicate heterogeneity of cell death mechanisms after exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors among human cancer cell lines.","['Bertrand, R', 'Sarang, M', 'Jenkin, J', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Pommier, Y']","['Bertrand R', 'Sarang M', 'Jenkin J', 'Kerrigan D', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Dec 1;51(23 Pt 1):6280-5.,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not known whether the inhibitory effect of gallium on ribonucleotide reductase is solely the result of limiting iron availability for enzyme activity or whether a direct effect of intracellular gallium on the enzyme is also involved. In the present study, utilizing a cell-free assay, we show that gallium nitrate directly inhibits CDP and ADP reductase activity. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by gallium nitrate thus appears to be due to a combination of a block in iron availability to ribonucleotide reductase and a direct inhibition of the enzyme by gallium.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Narasimhan, J', 'Guy, J', 'Sem, D S', ""O'Brien, W J""]","['Chitambar CR', 'Narasimhan J', 'Guy J', 'Sem DS', ""O'Brien WJ""]","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Nov 15;51(22):6199-201.,,,"['P30-EY01931/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its efficacy as an antileukemic agent, 6-MP has not been previously administered by the intrathecal (IT) route. In anticipation of a clinical trial of IT 6-MP, preclinical cytotoxicity and pharmacology studies were performed to define a safe, effective dose. The optimal concentration (greater than 1 microM) and duration of exposure (greater than 12 h) to 6-MP required for cytotoxicity were determined in vitro using human leukemia cell lines. The dose required to achieve the desired cerebrospinal fluid concentrations in humans was derived from pharmacokinetic parameters determined in rhesus monkeys. A phase I/II study was then performed in pediatric patients with refractory meningeal leukemia. Nine patients (aged 3.5 to 16 years) with chronic meningeal leukemia (2 to 6 central nervous system relapses) were entered onto the study. All had previously failed, at a minimum, IT methotrexate, IT cytarabine, and cranial (+/- spinal) radiation. A 10-mg IT dose of 6-MP (calculated to produce cytotoxic cerebrospinal fluid levels for 12 h) was administered twice weekly for 4 weeks. There were four complete responses and three partial responses. The duration of complete responses ranged from 7 to 22 weeks. Observed toxicities were not dose limiting and included mild headache (three patients) and minimal nausea (two patients). Pharmacokinetic studies performed in patients confirmed that cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 6-MP were greater than 1 microM for 12 h. These results indicate that the IT administration of 6-MP is feasible, is not associated with significant toxicity, and has definite activity in patients with refractory meningeal leukemia.","['Adamson, P C', 'Balis, F M', 'Arndt, C A', 'Holcenberg, J S', 'Narang, P K', 'Murphy, R F', 'Gillespie, A J', 'Poplack, D G']","['Adamson PC', 'Balis FM', 'Arndt CA', 'Holcenberg JS', 'Narang PK', 'Murphy RF', 'Gillespie AJ', 'Poplack DG']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Nov 15;51(22):6079-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditioning of the medium reduces the cytotoxic effect, suggesting that parinaric acid and not a metabolite is the active agent. The mechanism of parinaric acid toxicity appears to involve lipid peroxidation because the toxic action can be blocked by the addition of butylated hydroxytoluene. When U-937 cells are differentiated to the monocytic form, they become resistant to as much as 30 microM parinaric acid. This difference in sensitivity may be explained in part by the fact that the undifferentiated cells take up 3 to 4 times more parinaric acid. Concentrations of parinaric acid less than 5 microM are also toxic to human THP-1 monocytic leukemia, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia, and Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells. Measurements of protein synthesis indicate that differentiated U-937 cells, confluent cultures of human fibroblasts, bovine aortic endothelial cells, and CaCo-2 colonic mucosal cells are much less sensitive to parinaric acid than the malignant cell lines tested, suggesting that the cytotoxic action may be selective for rapidly growing malignant tumors. Thus, parinaric acid may be the prototype of a new class of lipid chemotherapeutic agents that contain a conjugated system of double bonds and act by sensitizing tumor cells to peroxidation.","['Cornelius, A S', 'Yerram, N R', 'Kratz, D A', 'Spector, A A']","['Cornelius AS', 'Yerram NR', 'Kratz DA', 'Spector AA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'PK8M3ENX8C (parinaric acid)']",IM,,"['Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Nov 15;51(22):6025-30.,,,['HL39308/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strains LY-R and LY-S differ in their relative sensitivities to UVC radiation, X-radiation, and PDT; both responded to PDT by undergoing apoptosis. The DNA was degraded into fragments with lengths which are multiples of approximately 180-190 base pairs (i.e., oligonucleosome size), a biochemical marker of apoptosis. The DNA fragmentation was dose and time dependent which indicates this response to be an enzymic process related to cell killing. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and actinomycin D, an RNA synthesis inhibitor, enhanced the endonucleolytic DNA fragmentation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed chromatin condensation around the periphery of the nucleus, which is also characteristic of apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis in L5178Y cells by PDT was rapid, with marked degradation of DNA occurring in as little as 30 min. The rapidity of the response to PDT suggests that cellular damage produced by PDT can directly activate endonucleolysis and chromatin condensation, thereby by-passing many of the early steps in the signal transduction program which are acted upon by other agents causing apoptosis.","['Agarwal, M L', 'Clay, M E', 'Harvey, E J', 'Evans, H H', 'Antunez, A R', 'Oleinick, N L']","['Agarwal ML', 'Clay ME', 'Harvey EJ', 'Evans HH', 'Antunez AR', 'Oleinick NL']","['Department of Radiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '14154-42-8 (chloroaluminum phthalocyanine)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)']",IM,,"['Aluminum/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Death/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chromatin/drug effects/radiation effects/ultrastructure', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'X-Rays']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Nov 1;51(21):5993-6.,,,"['P01CA-48735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37CA-15378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37CA-15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cobalt compounds produce tumors in animals and are probably carcinogenic to humans. The mechanisms of the carcinogenicity of these metal compounds, however, have remained elusive. In the present work, we have investigated the ability of Ni(II) and Co(II) ions in the presence of H2O2 to cause chemical changes in DNA bases in chromatin extracted from cultured cells of human origin. Eleven modified DNA bases in chromatin were identified and quantitated by the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 2-Hydroxyadenine (isoguanine), which has not previously been shown to occur DNA or chromatin, was also identified. Products identified were typical hydroxyl radical-induced products of DNA bases, suggesting that the hydroxyl radical was involved in their formation. This idea was supported by partial inhibition of product formation by typical scavengers of hydroxyl radical. Partial inhibition of product formation indicated a possible ""site-specific"" formation of hydroxyl radical by unchelated Ni(II) and Co(II) ions bound to chromatin. Although treatment of chromatin for 1 h with Co(II)/H2O2 caused formation of significant amounts of products, treatment with Ni(II)/H2O2 required incubation times of more than 5 h and an increase in Ni(II) concentration before increases in product amounts above background levels became detectable. In both cases, ascorbic acid did not increase product yields. Glutathione at a physiologically relevant concentration had little overall effect on DNA base modification. Superoxide dismutase increased the yields of most products. Chelation of Ni(II) and Co(II) ions with EDTA almost completely inhibited product formation. Ni(II) in the presence of H2O2 produced greater base damage to the DNA in chromatin than to isolated DNA, unlike other metal ions tested. DNA damage in chromatin caused by Ni(II) and Co(II) ions in the presence of H2O2 may contribute to the established genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of these metal ions.","['Nackerdien, Z', 'Kasprzak, K S', 'Rao, G', 'Halliwell, B', 'Dizdaroglu, M']","['Nackerdien Z', 'Kasprzak KS', 'Rao G', 'Halliwell B', 'Dizdaroglu M']","['Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*drug effects', 'Cobalt/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Histones/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Nickel/*pharmacology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Nov 1;51(21):5837-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A concordance study and a Pediatric Oncology Group study.,249-56,"Cytogenetic analysis yields important objective information that has been shown to correlate with both patient response to therapeutic intervention and patient survival. Bone marrow samples are submitted to a common reference laboratory for cytogenetic analysis from children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) registered on frontline Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) therapeutic studies (classification 8600 series). A portion of the sample from the Texas Children's Hospital (Houston, TX) a POG affiliate, was also submitted to a local cytogenetics laboratory for analysis. This study retrospectively compares karyotypic data and methods from the Laboratory of Medical Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham (reference laboratory) with those of the Kleberg Cytogenetics Laboratory at the Baylor College of Medicine (local laboratory) over a 35-month period to evaluate the effect of differences in specimen procurement, handling, and laboratory methodology on yield of cytogenetic information. Each laboratory was able to identify clonal abnormalities in 72% of cases examined during the last year of the study. When these data were combined, the overall detection rate of clonal abnormalities was 87.5%. Utilizing the same bone marrow aspirate from 73 children, this study demonstrates that cytogenetic methodology significantly affects the yield of identifiable clonal abnormalities, while variables such as overnight shipping have no discernable effect. This study also supports the contention that central laboratory testing effectively yields information critical to ongoing large-scale research endeavors.","['Katz, J A', 'Taylor, L D', 'Carroll, A', 'Elder, F F', 'Mahoney, D H']","['Katz JA', 'Taylor LD', 'Carroll A', 'Elder FF', 'Mahoney DH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90085-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90085-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Sep;55(2):249-56. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90085-9.,,,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,
