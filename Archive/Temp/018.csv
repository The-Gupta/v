However, it remains to be elucidated whether the CD19 CAR T cell therapy is effective for ALL cells in central nervous system (CNS) because the patients with isolated or advanced CNS disease were excluded from clinical trials of systemic intravenous (i.v.) delivery of CAR T cells. Therefore, the preclinical evaluation for the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy against ALL cells in CNS is essential for clinical application. We evaluated the effect and adverse reaction of CD19 CAR T cells against ALL in CNS using a xenograft mouse model by i.v. or intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) delivery of CAR T cells. Injection of piggyBac CD19 CAR T cells by i.v. had partial effects, whereas all CAR T i.c.v.-delivered mice had eliminated ALL in CNS. Although some CAR T i.c.v.-delivered mice showed transient changes of clinical symptoms during the first few days after treatment, none of CAR T i.c.v.-delivered mice displayed fatal adverse events.

The molecular mechanisms behind liver fibrosis remain largely unknown. Many studies have indicated the role of microRNA (miRNA) in hepatic tumorigenesis. But the role of miRNA in liver fibrosis is little known. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) can secret extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) and are the major contributors to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Here, a microarray assay of quiescent and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) activated HSCs indicated that miR-98 might play a crucial role in liver fibrosis. We found that miR-98 was significantly downregulated in activated HSCs. miR-98 overexpression inhibited HSCs activation. Furthermore, we hypothesized that miR-98 regulated hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) expression by binding to the 3' UTR of its mRNA directly, as evidenced by luciferase reporter assay. HLF overexpression increased HSCs activation by inducing hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression, resulting in the activation of TGF-beta/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Besides, low expression of miR-98 was also found in liver tissues from various fibrotic murine models, including carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), bile duct ligation (BDL), and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced liver fibrosis. miR-98 overexpression in vivo by ago-miR-98 injection could attenuate CCl4-, BDL-, and HFD-induced murine hepatic fibrosis. Meanwhile, miR-98 overexpression suppressed HLF expression and reduced fibrosis marker expression. Collectively, our study demonstrates that miR-98 suppress HSCs activation by targeting HLF directly and interacting with HIF-1alpha/TGF-beta/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, which may be an effective therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Wei, Zhou, Li, Zhou, Shi, Shi, Qiu and Lu.']","['Wang, Qi', 'Wei, Song', 'Zhou, Haoming', 'Li, Lei', 'Zhou, Shun', 'Shi, Chengyu',

This study was a retrospective analysis of the treatment results and genetic characteristics of ML of DS (ML-DS) in Poland from 2005 to 2019. Methods: All 54 patients with ML-DS registered in the Polish Pediatric Leukemia and Lymphoma Study Group in analyzed period were enrolled to the study. There were 34 children treated with Acute Myeloid Leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 2004 Interim Protocol (group I) and 20 patients treated with ML-DS 2006 Protocol (group II). In the first protocol, there was reduction of the antracyclines doses and intrathecal treatment for ML-DS compared to non-DS patients. In the second protocol, further reduction of the treatment was introduced (omission of etoposide in the last cycle, no maintenance therapy). Results: Probabilities of 5-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival in the whole analyzed group were 0.85 +/- 0.05, 0.83 +/- 0.05, and 0.97 +/- 0.03, respectively. No significant differences were found between two protocols in the terms of OS and EFS (0.79 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.05, p = 0.14, and 0.76 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.05, p = 0.12, respectively). All deaths were caused by the treatment-related toxicities. Reduction of the treatment-related mortality was noticed (20% in group I and 5% in group II). The only one relapse in the whole cohort occurred in the patient from group I, older than 4 years, without GATA1 gene mutation. He was treated successfully with IdaFLA cycle followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from matched sibling donor. No significant prognostic factor was found in the study group probably due to low number of patients in the subgroups. Conclusions: The study confirms that the reduced intensity protocols are very effective in ML-DS patients. The only cause of deaths was toxicities; however, systematic decrease of the treatment-related mortality was noticed.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Czogala, Pawinska-Wasikowska, Ksiazek, Sikorska-Fic,

However, the effect of FLT3 mutation on survival is currently still controversial and the leukemogenic mechanisms are still under further investigation. The aim of our study is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in FLT3-mutant AML and to find crucial DEGs whose expression level is related to prognosis for further analysis. By mining the TCGA-LAML dataset, 619 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and 1,428 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified between FLT3-mutant and FLT3-wildtype samples. Through weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and the following Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we constructed the prognostic risk models to identify the hub DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs associated with AML prognosis. The presence of both SH3TC2 divergent transcript (SH3TC2-DT) and SH3TC2 in respective prognostic risk models promotes us to further study the significance of this gene pair in AML. SH3TC2-DT and SH3TC2 were identified to be coordinately high expressed in FLT3-mutant AML samples. High expression of this gene pair was associated with poor survival. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that high SH3TC2-DT/SH3TC2 expression was associated with FLT3 mutation, high WBC count, and intermediate cytogenetic and molecular-genetic risk. AML with SH3TC2-DT/SH3TC2 high expression showed enrichment of transcripts associated with stemness, quiescence, and leukemogenesis. Our study suggests that the SH3TC2-DT/SH3TC2 gene pair may be a possible biomarker to further optimize AML prognosis and may function in stemness or quiescence of FLT3-mutant leukemic stem cells (LSCs).","['Copyright (c) 2020 Yu, Lan, Song and Pan.']","['Yu, Pengfei', 'Lan, Haifeng', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Pan, Zengkai']","['Yu P', 'Lan H', 'Song X', 'Pan Z']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hannover Medical School, Institute of Virology, Hanover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200619,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7318790,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3 mutation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'divergent transcription', 'prognostic signature', 'the cancer genome atlas']",,2020/07/09 06:00,2020/07/09 06:01,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00829 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 19;10:829. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00829. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to WHO, in Ukraine there was registered the highest number of measles cases in Europe during that period [8]. Measles is characterized by an acute course with fever, maculopapular rash, cough, conjunctivitis and can lead to central nervous system complications (encephalitis, encephalomyelitis) and bronchopulmonary system complications (laryngotracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia). In immunocompetent patients, viremia ends after the end of clinical signs, in contrast to immunosuppressed individuals, who could develop viremia from one month up to a year.

It is involved in the pathophysiology of multiple pathological entities (neoplasms, disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular and renal pathology etc.), as well as in the pharmacokinetics of specific treatments for these pathologies. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative disease for which current standard treatment is BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). It is known that OS is involved in CML pathogenesis and response to TKIs therapy, but in reality, there are a number of additional factors (associated comorbidities, specific therapies) that modulate oxidative status, possibly affecting the evolution and prognosis of CML. In the present paper we proposed the evaluation of OS in a group of patients with CML following treatment with TKIs, depending on the presence of comorbidities and associated treatments. There were considered associated comorbidities: diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease. The variability of the oxidative status was found depending on the type of associated comorbidity, but also according to the associated treatment, with the possibility of producing drug interactions between the standard treatment of CML and the associated specific therapies. Their impact on the prognosis of CML patients in treatment with TKIs is not negligible and may represent a future research topic.","['Copyright (c) 2014, Medical University Publishing House Craiova.']","['Pascu VInturiS, Emilia Georgiana', 'GAman, Amelia Maria']","['Pascu VInturiS EG', 'GAman AM']","['University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.', 'University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Filantropia Municipal Hospital, Craiova, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200331,Romania,Curr Health Sci J,Current health sciences journal,101597164,PMC7323725,['NOTNLM'],"['antioxidant capacity', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'comorbidity', 'reactive oxygen species']",,2020/07/09 06:00,2020/07/09 06:01,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12865/CHSJ.46.01.04 [doi]', '2020.1.04 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Health Sci J. 2020 Jan-Mar;46(1):23-30. doi: 10.12865/CHSJ.46.01.04.

Phosphorylated level of RSK (T573) was increased in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and associated with poor survival. To examine the role of RSK in AML, we analyzed apoptosis and the cell cycle profile following treatment with BI-D1870, a potent inhibitor of RSK. BI-D1870 treatment increased the G2/M population and induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and patient AML cells. Characterization of mitotic phases showed that the metaphase/anaphase transition was significantly inhibited by BI-D1870. BI-D1870 treatment impeded the association of activator CDC20 with APC/C, but increased binding of inhibitor MAD2 to CDC20, preventing mitotic exit. Moreover, the inactivation of spindle assembly checkpoint or MAD2 knockdown released cells from BI-D1870-induced metaphase arrest. Therefore, we investigated whether BI-D1870 potentiates the anti-leukemic activity of vincristine by targeting mitotic exit. Combination treatment of BI-D1870 and vincristine synergistically increased mitotic arrest and apoptosis in acute leukemia cells. These data show that BI-D1870 induces apoptosis of AML cells alone and in combination with vincristine through blocking mitotic exit, providing a novel approach to overcoming vincristine resistance in AML cells.",,"['Chae, Hee-Don', 'Dutta, Ritika', 'Tiu, Bruce', 'Hoff, Fieke W', 'Accordi, Benedetta', 'Serafin, Valentina', 'Youn, Minyoung', 'Huang, Min', 'Sumarsono, Nathan', 'Davis, Kara L', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Chae HD', 'Dutta R', 'Tiu B', 'Hoff FW', 'Accordi B', 'Serafin V', 'Youn M', 'Huang M', 'Sumarsono N', 'Davis KL', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Pigazzi M', 'Horton TM', 'Kornblau SM', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Onco-Hematology Clinic, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Onco-Hematology Clinic, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Onco-Hematology Clinic, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200623,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC7321696,['NOTNLM'],"['BI-D1870', 'RSK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'spindle assembly checkpoint', 'vincristine']",['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],2020/07/09 06:00,2020/07/09 06:01,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27630 [doi]', '27630 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Jun 23;11(25):2387-2403. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27630. eCollection 2020 Jun 23.,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated with the potent anti-tumor antibiotic calicheamicin, represents a promising targeted therapy for AML. Annexin A5 (ANXA5) is a proposed marker for the clinical prognosis of AML to guide treatment choice. Methods: In total, 253 patients with pediatric AML were enrolled and divided into two treatment groups: conventional chemotherapy alone and conventional chemotherapy in combination with GO. Univariate, multivariate, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted to assess risk factors and clinical outcomes, and to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence interval. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: In the GO treatment group, high ANXA5 expression was considered a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). Multivariate analysis showed that high ANXA5 expression was an independent favorable factor for OS (HR = 0.629, p = 0.084) and EFS (HR = 0.544, p = 0.024) distinct from the curative effect of GO treatment. When all patients were again divided into two groups, this time based on the median expression of ANXA5, patients undergoing chemotherapy combined with GO had significantly better OS (p = 0.0012) and EFS (p = 0.0003) in the ANXA5 high-expression group. Gene set enrichment analysis identified a relevant series of pathways associated with glutathione metabolism, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and hematopoietic cell lineage. Conclusion: The expression level of ANXA5 can help optimize the treatment regimen for individual patients, and patients with overexpression of ANXA5 may circumvent poor outcomes from chemotherapy combined with GO.","['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']","['Zhang, Nan', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Lou, Shifeng', 'Chen, Ying', 'Li, Huan', 'Zeng, Hanqing', 'Shen, Yan', 'Deng, Jianchuan']","['Zhang N', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang P', 'Lou S', 'Chen Y', 'Li H', 'Zeng H', 'Shen Y', 'Deng J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Jiangnan, Chongqing, P.R.

These features are typical of early-memory T cells, which can be enriched with specific manufacturing procedures, providing signal one and signal two in the proper steric conformation and in the presence of homeostatic cytokines. In this project, we exploited our expertise with paramagnetic beads and IL-7/IL-15 to develop an optimized protocol for CAR T cell production based on reagents, including a polymeric nanomatrix, which are compatible with automated manufacturing via the CliniMACS Prodigy. We found that both procedures generate similar CAR T cell products, highly enriched of stem cell memory T cells (TSCM) and equally effective in counteracting tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Most importantly, the optimized protocol was able to expand CAR TSCM from B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, which in origin were highly enriched of late-memory and exhausted T cells. Notably, CAR T cells derived from B-ALL patients proved to be as efficient as healthy donor-derived CAR T cells in mediating profound and prolonged anti-tumor responses in xenograft mouse models. On the contrary, the protocol failed to expand fully functional CAR TSCM from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that patient-specific factors may profoundly affect intrinsic T cell quality. Finally, by retrospective analysis of in vivo data, we observed that the proportion of TSCM in the final CAR T cell product positively correlated with in vivo expansion, which in turn proved to be crucial for achieving long-term remissions. Collectively, our data indicate that next-generation manufacturing protocols can overcome initial T cell defects, resulting in TSCM-enriched CAR T cell products qualitatively equivalent to the ones generated from healthy donors. However, this positive effect may be decreased in specific conditions, for which the development of further improved protocols and novel strategies might be highly beneficial.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Arcangeli, Falcone, Camisa, De Girardi, Biondi, Giglio,', 'Ciceri, Bonini, Bondanza and Casucci.']","['Arcangeli, Silvia', 'Falcone, Laura', 'Camisa, Barbara', 'De Girardi, Federica', 'Biondi, Marta', 'Giglio, Fabio', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Casucci, Monica']","['Arcangeli S', 'Falcone L', 'Camisa B', 'De Girardi F', 'Biondi M', 'Giglio F', 'Ciceri F', 'Bonini C', 'Bondanza A', 'Casucci M']","['Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Experimental Hematology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Experimental Hematology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200619,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7317024,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL and PDAC', '*CAR T', '*CAR T cell fitness', '*CAR T cell manufacturing', '*CAR design', '*patient samples']",,2020/07/09 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01217 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jun 19;11:1217. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01217. eCollection 2020.,,,,20210405,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical/*methods', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 transmits through mother-to-child infection via breastfeeding, sexual intercourses, and blood transfusions. Early HTLV-1 infection, presumably through mother's milk, is crucial in developing ATL. The estimated cumulative risk of the development of ATL in HTLV-1 carriers is a few percent after transmission from their mothers. The median age of ATL onset is about 70 in Japan and is now rising, whereas an overall mean age in the mid-forties is reported in other parts of the world. ATL is classified into four clinical subtypes (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering) defined by organ lesions and LDH/calcium values. In aggressive ATL (acute, lymphoma or unfavorable chronic types) and indolent ATL (favorable chronic or smoldering types), intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and watchful waiting until disease progression has been recommended, respectively, in Japan. Based on a worldwide meta-analysis and multiple other retrospective studies, the antiviral combination of interferon alpha (IFN) and zidovudine (AZT) is recommended in many parts of the world in acute, chronic, and smoldering ATL whereas patients with the lymphoma subtype are treated with chemotherapy, either alone or combined with AZT/IFN. Several new agents have been approved for ATL by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) after clinical trials, including an anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody, mogamulizumab; an immunomodulatory agent, lenalidomide; and an anti-CD30 antibody/drug conjugate, brentuximab vedotin.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Tsukasaki, Marcais, Nasr, Kato, Fukuda, Hermine and', 'Bazarbachi.']","['Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Marcais, Ambroise', 'Nasr, Rihab', 'Kato, Koji', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Tsukasaki K', 'Marcais A', 'Nasr R', 'Kato K', 'Fukuda T', 'Hermine O', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Hematology, International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Institut Imagine - INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital, University of Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Necker Hospital, University of Paris, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institut Imagine - INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital, University of Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Necker Hospital, University of Paris, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200619,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC7317092,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL)', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)', 'chemotherapy', 'treatment', 'zidovudine (AZT)']",,2020/07/09 06:00,2020/07/09 06:01,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.01207 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Jun 19;11:1207. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01207. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Herein, the interaction of as-synthesized Co3O4 NPs with HSA was explored by different kinds of fluorescence and CD spectroscopic methods, as well as molecular docking studies. Also, the anticancer effect of Co3O4 NPs against leukemia K562 cells was investigated by MTT, LDH, caspase, real-time PCR, ROS, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. Afterwards, the antibacterial effects of Co3O4 NPs against three pathogenic bacteria were disclosed by antibacterial assays. Results: Different characterization methods such as TEM, DLS, zeta potential and XRD studies proved that fabricated Co3O4 NPs by sol-gel method have a diameter of around 50 nm, hydrodynamic radius of 177 nm with a charge distribution of -33.04 mV and a well-defined crystalline phase. Intrinsic, extrinsic, and synchronous fluorescence as well as CD studies, respectively, showed that the HSA undergoes some fluorescence quenching, minor conformational changes, microenvironmental changes as well as no structural changes in the secondary structure, after interaction with Co3O4 NPs. Molecular docking results also verified that the spherical clusters with a dimension of 1.5 nm exhibit the most binding energy with HSA molecules. Anticancer assays demonstrated that Co3O4 NPs can selectively lead to the reduction of K562 cell viability through the cell membrane damage, activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3, elevation of Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio, ROS production, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Finally, antibacterial assays disclosed that Co3O4 NPs can stimulate a promising antibacterial effect against pathogenic bacteria. Conclusion: In general, these observations can provide useful information for the early stages of nanomaterial applications in therapeutic platforms.",['(c) 2020 Arsalan et al.'],"['Arsalan, Niloofar', 'Hassan Kashi, Elahe', 'Hasan, Anwarul', 'Edalat Doost, Mona', 'Rasti, Behnam', 'Ahamad Paray, Bilal', 'Zahed Nakhjiri, Mona', 'Sari, Soyar', 'Sharifi, Majid', 'Shahpasand, Koorosh', 'Akhtari, Keivan', 'Haghighat, Setareh', 'Falahati, Mojtaba']","['Arsalan N', 'Hassan Kashi E', 'Hasan A', 'Edalat Doost M', 'Rasti B', 'Ahamad Paray B', 'Zahed Nakhjiri M', 'Sari S', 'Sharifi M', 'Shahpasand K', 'Akhtari K', 'Haghighat S', 'Falahati M']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Lahijan Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAU), Lahijan, Guilan, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha 2713, Qatar.', 'Biomedical Research Centre, Qatar University, Doha 2713, Qatar.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Lahijan Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAU), Lahijan, Guilan, Iran.', 'Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Lahijan Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAU), Lahijan, Guilan, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nanotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology (RI-SCBT), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Physics, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nanotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200625,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC7328876,['NOTNLM'],"['antibacterial', 'anticancer', 'cobalt oxide', 'docking', 'nanoparticle', 'spectroscopy', 'synthesis']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2020/07/09 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S257711 [doi]', '257711 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2020 Jun 25;15:4607-4623. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S257711. eCollection 2020.,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8380-2233', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5061-3142', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1546-7864', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2153-0564']",20200825,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxides)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', 'USK772NS56 (cobalt oxide)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cobalt/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Oxides/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/drug effects', 'Serum Albumin, Human/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied a large family consisting of several affected individuals with hematologic abnormalities, including one family member who died of acute leukemia. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel frameshift variant in the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1). This heterozygous variant (c.1995delA) truncates the canonical Sp1 molecule in the highly conserved C-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger domains. Transcriptomic analysis and gene promoter characterization in patients' blood revealed a hypermorphic effect of this Sp1 variant, triggering superactivation of Sp1-mediated transcription and driving significant up-regulation of Sp1 target genes.

Adult patients fit for pediatric-inspired protocols have an excellent outcome with chemotherapy alone. However, it is unclear whether patients receiving hyper-CVAD should undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as postremission therapy. Our aim was to examine the role of HCT at first complete remission (CR1) in adult ALL/LBL after hyper-CVAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL/LBL receiving frontline hyper-CVAD from 2008 to 2018 were identified and records retrospectively extracted. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were identified and included for further analysis. The median (range) age was 23 (14-68) years, and 56 (66%) were male. A total of 24 (28%) had adverse cytogenetics, and 48 (56%) had at least one risk factor. All patients received hyper-CVAD as induction; induction failure was seen in 10 (12%). A total of 38 patients continued the hyper-CVAD course, while the remaining 47 received HCT in CR1. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival for the entire cohort were 51.4% and 61.6%, respectively. Median follow-up of alive patients was 39.9 (3.8-123.8) months. At multivariable analysis for EFS, induction failure was associated with worse outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-13.7; P = .003), whereas HCT in CR1 improved outcome (HR, 0.42; 95% CI 0.18-0.97; P = .044). Furthermore, HCT in CR1 was the only prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0.3; 95% CI 0.11-0.85; P = .023). CONCLUSION: HCT at CR1 resulted in a favorable EFS and overall survival in ALL/LBL patients after hyper-CVAD frontline therapy.

This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the TGP (paclitaxel, gemcitabine, cisplatin) combination chemotherapy as a second-line salvage therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 16 consecutive patients with metastatic GCC who had been treated with first-line VIP therapy followed by second-line TGP therapy between 2005 and 2019 were reviewed and statistically analyzed. Ten patients, excluding the 6 patients treated with TGP without unequivocal progression, were included in the efficacy analysis. All 16 patients were included in the safety analysis. RESULTS: The median follow-up period from initial TGP administration was 78 months (interquartile range, 46-120 months). The estimated 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates for the 10 patients in the efficacy analysis were 70% and 100%, respectively. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred in all 16 patients, but none developed uncontrollable infections or life-threatening bleeding. One patient died of treatment-related secondary leukemia, however. CONCLUSION: The present study is to our knowledge the first to examine the therapeutic outcomes and safety profile of second-line TGP chemotherapy. VIP followed by TGP might be an alternative first- and second-line conventional regimen for patients with metastatic GCC in this granulocyte colony-stimulating factor era, especially for patients at a high risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In order to exert its pharmacological effect, ribavirin has to enter cancer cells. However, there is little information concerning the transport mechanism of ribavirin into K562 cells. In this study, therefore, we examined the uptake mechanism of ribavirin in K562 cells. The uptake of ribavirin in K562 cells was time- and temperature-dependent, and was saturable with a Km value of 1.5 mM. Ribavirin uptake was inhibited by nucleosides such as adenosine and uridine, and by inhibitors of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) such as S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine and dipyridamole in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the expression of ENT1 mRNA in K562 cells was confirmed by real-time PCR. On the other hand, Na(+)-dependence of ribavirin uptake was not observed, suggesting the involvement of ENT1, but not Na(+)-dependent concentrative nucleoside transporters, in ribavirin uptake in K562 cells. Treatment of K562 cells with sodium butyrate induced erythroid differentiation, but ribavirin uptake activity and sensitivity of the uptake to various inhibitors were not different between native and differentiated K562 cells. These results suggest that ribavirin uptake into K562 cells is mainly mediated by ENT1, which may have a pivotal role in anticancer effect of ribavirin.",,"['Takano, M', 'Higashi, M', 'Baba, S', 'Kawami, M', 'Yumoto, R']","['Takano M', 'Higashi M', 'Baba S', 'Kawami M', 'Yumoto R']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan;, Email: takanom@hiroshima-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,,,,,2020/07/09 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1691/ph.2020.0440 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmazie. 2020 Jul 1;75(7):329-334. doi: 10.1691/ph.2020.0440.,,7,,20210527,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribavirin/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although its overall prognosis is good, the outcome after relapse is poor. CD19 is highly expressed on the membrane of most malignant B-cells, and was shown to be a promising therapeutic target of B-LL. In this present work, we designed and synthesized a novel drug carrier, anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody-conjugated human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSA-CD19 NPs). Doxorubicin (DOX) was well encapsulated into the HSA-CD19 NPs to form an anticancer nanodrug DOX/HSA-CD19. DOX/HSA-CD19 was preferentially uptaken by CD19(+) B-LL cell line KOPN-8. DOX/HSA-CD19 showed strong antiproliferative effect on KOPN-8 cells with an IC50 value of 4.1 mug/mL. Further, proapoptotic Bax and caspase-3 were significantly elevated, but antiapoptotic Bcl2 was reduced in DOX/HSA-CD19 treated KOPN-8 cells, indicating the activation of the apoptosis pathway by the nanodrug. By contrast, DOX/HSA-CD19 did not show affinity to CD19-monocytic cell line, U937, and did not affect its proliferation.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian man, positive for asymptomatic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, presented with a blind painful right eye in our ophthalmology department to evaluate enucleation bulbi. After enucleation, a histopathologic examination revealed the presence of intertrabecular infiltration in the metaplastic bone marrow of non-Hodgkin B lymphoma, with small lymphocytes, with similar characteristics to the already known disease. CONCLUSION: This uncommon case reveals the possibility of the localization of malignant cells within bone metaplasia of intraocular ossification in an enucleated blind painful eye.

New drugs which improve the outcome of AML patients are urgently required. In this work, the activity and mechanism of action of the cytotoxic indole alkaloid Jerantinine B (JB), was examined in AML cells. METHODS: We used a combination of proliferation and apoptosis assays to assess the effect of JB on AML cell lines and patient samples, with BH3 profiling being performed to identify early effects of the drug (4 h). Phosphokinase arrays were adopted to identify potential driver proteins in the cellular response to JB, the results of which were confirmed and extended using western blotting and inhibitor assays and measuring levels of reactive oxygen species. RESULTS: AML cell growth was significantly impaired following JB exposure in a dose-dependent manner; potent colony inhibition of primary patient cells was also observed. An apoptotic mode of death was demonstrated using Annexin V and upregulation of apoptotic biomarkers (active caspase 3 and cleaved PARP). Using BH3 profiling, JB was shown to prime cells to apoptosis at an early time point (4 h) and phospho-kinase arrays demonstrated this to be associated with a strong upregulation and activation of both total and phosphorylated c-Jun (S63). The mechanism of c-Jun activation was probed and significant induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was demonstrated which resulted in an increase in the DNA damage response marker gammaH2AX. This was further verified by the loss of JB-induced C-Jun activation and maintenance of cell viability when using the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). CONCLUSIONS: This work provides the first evidence of cytotoxicity of JB against AML cells and identifies ROS-induced c-Jun activation as the major mechanism of action.",,"['Alhuthali, Hayaa Moeed', 'Bradshaw, Tracey D', 'Lim, Kuan-Hon', 'Kam, Toh-Seok', 'Seedhouse, Claire H']","['Alhuthali HM', 'Bradshaw TD', 'Lim KH', 'Kam TS', 'Seedhouse CH']","['Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Room B209, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.', ""College of Applied Medical Science, Taif University, Ta'if, Saudi Arabia."", 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Semenyih, Malaysia.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Room B209, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.

In this study, we investigated the molecular role of Notch-1 signaling in the macrophage response during MAP infection. In particular, we measured the in vitro effect of MAP on Notch-1 signaling and downstream influence on interleukin (IL)-6 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL-1) and consequent cellular apoptosis, MAP viability, and macrophage polarization. Overall, the data show significant upregulation in Notch-1, IL-6, and MCL-1 in MAP-infected macrophages, parallel with a decrease in apoptosis and elevated pro-inflammatory response in these infected cells. On the contrary, blocking Notch signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) decreased MAP survival and burden, increased apoptosis, and diminished the pro-inflammatory response. In particular, the treatment of infected macrophages with DAPT shifted macrophage polarization toward M2 anti-inflammatory phenotypic response. The outcome of this study clearly demonstrates the critical role of Notch signaling in macrophage response during infection. We conclude that MAP infection in macrophages activates Notch-1 signaling and downstream influence on IL-6 which hijack MCL-1 dependent inhibition of apoptosis leading to its chronic persistence, and further inflammation.

The clinical inadequacy of most anticancer therapeutics urgently prompted intense drug discovery efforts toward the identification of new chemical entities endowed with a potent and safe antitumor profile. In this scenario, targeting cancer cells apoptosis machinery has emerged as a relevant strategy, useful for tackling the emergence of drug resistance. On this basis, a small library of naturally inspired hybrid molecules was obtained by combining, through a click chemistry approach, ""privileged"" synthons such as curcumin scaffold and 1,2,3-triazole building block. Compound 1, bearing a para-fluoro phenyl moiety, showed low-micromolar potency against T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell growth. More in-depth biologic studies demonstrated, for this analog, cell death-inducing properties associated with its capability to simultaneously activate both the receptor and the mitochondrial apoptosis cascades. This peculiar behavior offers promises for achieving an expanded anticancer effect, namely intense cytotoxic response coupled with reduced predisposition of chemoresistance insurgence.

In the present study, we evaluated antitumor efficacies of a specific green tea, sencha tea, on sensitive and multidrug-resistant leukemia and a panel of nine multiple myelomas (MM) cell lines. We found that sencha extracts induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cells and MM cells to different extents, yet its effect on normal cells was limited. Furthermore, sencha extracts caused G2/M and G0/G1 phase arrest during cell cycle progression in CCRF/CEM and KMS-12-BM cells, respectively. Specifically, sencha-MeOH/H2O extracts induced apoptosis, ROS, and MMP collapse on both CCRF/CEM and KMS-12-BM cells. The analysis with microarray and COMPARE in 53 cell lines of the NCI panel revealed diverse functional groups, including cell morphology, cellular growth and proliferation, cell cycle, cell death, and survival, which were closely associated with anti-tumor effects of sencha tea. It is important to note that PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB pathways were the top two dominant networks by ingenuity pathway analysis.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were carried out in matched diagnosis-relapse samples from 13 BCP-ALL patients to identify patterns of genetic evolution that could account for the phenotypic changes associated with disease relapse. The integrative genomic analysis of aCGH, MLPA and NGS revealed that 100% of the BCP-ALL patients showed at least one genetic alteration at diagnosis and relapse. In addition, there was a significant increase in the frequency of chromosomal lesions at the time of relapse (p = 0.019). MLPA and aCGH techniques showed that IKZF1 was the most frequently deleted gene. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene at relapse. Two TP53 mutations were detected only at relapse, whereas the three others showed an increase in their mutational burden at relapse. Clonal evolution patterns were heterogeneous, involving the acquisition, loss and maintenance of lesions at relapse. Therefore, this study provides additional evidence that BCP-ALL is a genetically dynamic disease with distinct genetic profiles at diagnosis and relapse.

Inhibition of proteasome activity results in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) characterized by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha), global translational arrest, and increased expression of the proapoptotic CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) protein. Defects in the UPR response has been reported to result in altered sensitivity of tumor cells to proteasome inhibitors. Here, we characterized the effects of the deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor VLX1570 on protein homeostasis, both at the level of the UPR and on protein translation, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Similar to the 20S inhibitor bortezomib, VLX1570 induced accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and increased expression of the chaperone Grp78/Bip in ALL cells. Both compounds induced cleavage of PARP (Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) in ALL cells, consistent with induction of apoptosis. However, and in contrast to bortezomib, VLX1570 treatment resulted in limited induction of the proapoptotic CHOP protein. Translational inhibition was observed by both bortezomib and VLX1570. We report that in distinction to bortezomib, suppression of translation by VXL1570 occurred at the level of elongation. Increased levels of Hsc70/Hsp70 proteins were observed on polysomes following exposure to VLX1570, possibly suggesting defects in nascent protein folding.

Endocytosis and endosome acidification inhibitors inhibit infection by CHIKV, murine leukemia virus (MLV), or SARS-coronavirus, indicating that these viral entries into host cells occur through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Although endosomal cathepsin B protease is necessary for MLV, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV infections, its role in CHIKV infection is unknown. Our results revealed that endocytosis inhibitors attenuated CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection in 293T cells but not in TE671 cells. In contrast, macropinocytosis inhibitors attenuated CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection in TE671 cells but not in 293T cells, suggesting that CHIKV host cell entry occurs via endocytosis or macropinocytosis, depending on the cell lines used.

METHODS: In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte model showed that miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b, and miR-499 are released from cells into culture medium in a time- and dose-dependent manner on doxorubicin exposure. Left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation and circulating heart-associated miRs and plasma hs-cTnT during and after completion of chemotherapy were determined in 40 children with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia. RESULTS: Significant reduction of LV global longitudinal strain and strain rates were found within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction phase of treatment (all p < 0.05). Hs-cTnT level peaked and miR-1 increased significantly at this time point. Log-transformed hs-cTnT correlated negatively with LV global systolic longitudinal strain (r = -0.38, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that area under the curve for changes in plasma hs-cTnT from baseline and plasma miR-1 levels in detecting a reduction in >/=20% of global longitudinal strain were respectively 0.62 (95% CI 0.38-0.87) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.84). CONCLUSION: Plasma hs-cTnT and circulating miR-1 may be useful markers of myocardial damage during chemotherapy in children with leukaemias. IMPACT: Heart-associated miRNAs including miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b,and miR-499 were increased in the culture medium upon exposure of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin. Only miR-1 increased significantly during anthracycline-based therapy in paediatric leukaemic patients. In paediatric leukaemic patients, plasma hs-cTnT and circulating level of miR-1 showed the most significant increase within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction treatment phase. The study provides the first evidence of progressive increase in circulating miR-1 and plasma hs-cTnT levels during the course of anthracycline-based therapy in children with leukaemias, with hs-cTnT level also associated with changes in LV myocardial deformation.",,"['Cheung, Yiu-Fai', 'Li, Vivian Wing-Yi', 'Lai, Clare Tik-Man', 'Shin, Vivian Yvonne', 'Keung, Wendy', 'Cheuk, Daniel Ka-Leung', 'Kwong, Ava', 'Li, Ronald Adolphus', 'Chan, Godfrey Chi-Fung']","['Cheung YF', 'Li VW', 'Lai CT', 'Shin VY', 'Keung W', 'Cheuk DK', 'Kwong A', 'Li RA', 'Chan GC']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. xfcheung@hku.hk.', 'Dr. Li Dak-Sum Research Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. xfcheung@hku.hk.', 'Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Hong Kong, China. xfcheung@hku.hk.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Dr. Li Dak-Sum Research Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Dr. Li Dak-Sum Research Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Dr. Li Dak-Sum Research Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200707,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,,,,,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41390-020-1049-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41390-020-1049-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2021 Apr;89(5):1245-1252. doi: 10.1038/s41390-020-1049-5.

This report describes, to our knowledge, the first adult case of a primary cauda equina T-LBL. Treatment consists of multiagent chemotherapy, and surgical removal of T-LBL does not improve outcome. We discuss the workup of patients with an intradural spinal mass, together with a review of the literature on primary spinal lymphoma of the cauda equina. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old woman with Crohn's disease, for which she was taking immunosuppressive medication, presented with progressive back pain radiating to both legs and deteriorating neurologic deficits caused by an intradural, contrast-enhancing lesion in the L1-5 region. During acute surgery, the tumor was partially resected. Immunohistochemical phenotyping revealed a T-LBL. No other lymphoma localizations were found after subsequent staging. Despite extensive treatment, the patient died of disseminated disease throughout the central nervous system, 6 weeks after the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pain and progressive neurologic complaints can be symptoms of a (malignant) intradural spinal tumor. Intradural lymphoma must be considered as a differential diagnosis by clinicians because it can mimic neoplasms that often require urgent surgery. The histopathologic diagnosis should preferably be obtained by way of cerebrospinal fluid analysis or tumor biopsy because tumor resection has no beneficial effect on the oncologic outcome.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Glucose transporters (GLUTs), which facilitate the transport of glucose and related hexoses across the cell membrane, play a vital role in tumor cell survival and are overexpressed in various cancers. GLUT1, the most overexpressed GLUT in many cancers, is emerging as a promising anti-cancer target. To develop GLUT1 inhibitors, we rationally designed, synthesized, structurally characterized, and biologically evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo a novel series of furyl-2-methylene thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Among 25 TZDs tested, F18 and F19 inhibited GLUT1 most potently (IC50 11.4 and 14.7 muM, respectively). F18 was equally selective for GLUT4 (IC50 6.8 muM), while F19 was specific for GLUT1 (IC50 152 muM in GLUT4). In-silico ligand docking studies showed that F18 interacted with conserved residues in GLUT1 and GLUT4, while F19 had slightly different interactions with the transporters. In in-vitro antiproliferative screening of leukemic/lymphoid cells, F18 was most lethal to CEM cells (CC50 of 1.7 muM). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that F18 arrested cell cycle growth in the subG0-G1 phase and lead to cell death due to necrosis and apoptosis. Western blot analysis exhibited alterations in cell signaling proteins, consistent with cell growth arrest and death. In-vivo xenograft study in a CEM model showed that F18 impaired tumor growth significantly.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Over the past three years, the role of circRNAs in hematological malignancies has received increasing attention. Related research has shown that circRNAs may regulate the occurrence and development of hematological malignancies and contribute to drug resistance through a variety of molecular mechanisms.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with KMT2A-fusions and KMT2A partial tandem duplications (KMT2APTD) are known to depend on the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79). About 30% of KMT2APTD AMLs carry mutations in IDH1/2 (mIDH1/2). Previous studies showed that 2-hydroxyglutarate produced by mIDH1/2 increases H3K79 methylation, and mIDH1/2 patient samples are sensitive to DOT1L inhibition. Together, these findings suggested that stabilization or increases in H3K79 methylation associated with IDH mutations support the proliferation of leukemias dependent on this mark. However, we found that mIDH1/2 and KMT2A alterations failed to cooperate in an experimental model. Instead, mIDH1/2 and 2-hydroxyglutarate exert toxic effects, specifically on KMT2A-rearranged AML cells (fusions/partial tandem duplications). Mechanistically, we uncover an epigenetic barrier to efficient cooperation; mIDH1/2 expression is associated with high global histone 3 lysine 79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) levels, whereas global H3K79me2 is obligate low in KMT2A-rearranged AML. Increasing H3K79me2 levels, specifically in KMT2A-rearrangement leukemias, resulted in transcriptional downregulation of KMT2A target genes and impaired leukemia cell growth. Our study details a complex genetic and epigenetic interaction of 2 classes of oncogenes, IDH1/2 mutations and KMT2A rearrangements, that is unexpected based on the high percentage of IDH mutations in KMT2APTD AML. KMT2A rearrangements are associated with a trend toward lower response rates to mIDH1/2 inhibitors. The substantial adaptation that has to occur for 2 initially counteracting mutations to be tolerated within the same leukemic cell may provide at least a partial explanation for this observation.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kingsley, Molly C', 'Xie, Hongbo M', 'Chen, Bo-Rui', 'Riedel, Simone S', 'Pastuer, Taylor', 'Bollig, Madelyn K', 'Shank, Tyler', 'Libbrecht, Clara', 'Stabler, Sally P', 'Deshpande, Aniruddha J', 'Intlekofer, Andrew M', 'Bernt, Kathrin M']","['Kingsley MC', 'Xie HM', 'Chen BR', 'Riedel SS', 'Pastuer T', 'Bollig MK', 'Shank T', 'Libbrecht C', 'Stabler SP', 'Deshpande AJ', 'Intlekofer AM', 'Bernt KM']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant, University of Colorado School of Medicine-Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, Sanford Burnham Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant, University of Colorado School of Medicine-Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant, University of Colorado School of Medicine-Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant, University of Colorado School of Medicine-Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado-Denver, Aurora, CO.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, Sanford Burnham Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania-Abramson Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC7362367,,,,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31640-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001922 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jul 14;4(13):3109-3122. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001922.,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008730/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA251543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA201483/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",13,,20210519,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Oncogenes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a high incidence of adverse events has led to frequent discontinuations, limiting the clinical development of these inhibitors. By contrast, the dual PI3Kdelta/casein kinase-1-epsilon (CK1epsilon) inhibitor umbralisib (TGR-1202) also shows high rates of response in clinical trials but has an improved safety profile with fewer severe adverse events. Toxicities typical of this class of PI3K inhibitors are largely thought to be immune mediated, but they are poorly characterized. Here, we report the effects of idelalisib, duvelisib, and umbralisib on regulatory T cells (Tregs) on normal human T cells, T cells from CLL patients, and T cells in an Emu-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse CLL model. Ex vivo studies revealed differential effects of these PI3K inhibitors; only umbralisib treatment sustained normal and CLL-associated FoxP3+ human Tregs. Further, although all 3 inhibitors exhibit antitumor efficacy in the Emu-TCL1 CLL model, idelalisib- or duvelisib-treated mice displayed increased immune-mediated toxicities, impaired function, and reduced numbers of Tregs, whereas Treg number and function were preserved in umbralisib-treated CLL-bearing mice. Finally, our studies demonstrate that inhibition of CK1epsilon can improve CLL Treg number and function. Interestingly, CK1epsilon inhibition mitigated impairment of CLL Tregs by PI3K inhibitors in combination treatment. These results suggest that the improved safety profile of umbralisib is due to its role as a dual PI3Kdelta/CK1epsilon inhibitor that preserves Treg number and function.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Maharaj, Kamira', 'Powers, John J', 'Achille, Alex', 'Mediavilla-Varela, Melanie', 'Gamal, Wael', 'Burger, Karen L', 'Fonseca, Renee', 'Jiang, Kun', 'Miskin, Hari P', 'Maryanski, Dave', 'Monastyrskyi, Andrii', 'Duckett, Derek R', 'Roush, William R', 'Cleveland, John L', 'Sahakian, Eva', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Maharaj K', 'Powers JJ', 'Achille A', 'Mediavilla-Varela M', 'Gamal W', 'Burger KL', 'Fonseca R', 'Jiang K', 'Miskin HP', 'Maryanski D', 'Monastyrskyi A', 'Duckett DR', 'Roush WR', 'Cleveland JL', 'Sahakian E', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Malignant Hematology.', 'Department of Immunology, and.', 'Department of Cancer Biology PhD Program, University of South Florida and H.

The primary objective of phase 1b was to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and phase 2 was to assess spleen volume reduction at weeks 24 and 48. Fifty patients were enrolled. In the dose-escalation phase (n = 23), doses for sonidegib once daily/ruxolitinib twice daily were 400/10 mg (level 1, n = 8), 400/15 mg (level 2, n = 10), and 400/20 mg (level 3, n = 5). Two patients had dose-limiting toxicity at level 2: increased blood creatine phosphokinase (grades 3 and 4, n = 1 each). MTD/RP2D was determined as sonidegib 400 mg daily + ruxolitinib 20 mg twice daily. In phase 1b expansion and phase 2 stage 1 (n = 27), by weeks 24 and 48, >/=35% reduction in spleen volume was observed in 44.4% and 29.6% patients, respectively.

Most common treatment-related adverse events (grade 3/4) were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (18%), anemia (14%), and thrombocytopenia (12%). Four deaths were reported due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (on-treatment; no relationship with study treatment), acute myeloid leukemia, MF progression, and aspiration pneumonia. Although well tolerated, this combination will not be further developed in MF patients due to modest overall benefit compared with historical ruxolitinib monotherapy.

Autophagy has a central role in energy production and metabolism of the cells during starvation, cellular stress adaption, and removing mechanisms for aged or damaged organelles. The role and importance of autophagy pathways are becoming increasingly recognized in the literature because these pathways can be useful in organizing intracellular circulation, molecular complexes, and organelles to meet the needs of various hematopoietic cells. There is supporting evidence in the literature that autophagy plays an emerging role in the regulation of normal cells and that it also has important features in malignant hematopoiesis. Understanding the molecular details of the autophagy pathway can provide novel methods for more effective treatment of patients with leukemia.

Lots of kinds of different chromosomal translocations can be found in those leukemic cells. However, the role of abnormal chromosomes and genes in leukemogenesis is not yet fully understood. Identifying new chromosomal translocations can facilitate a better understanding of pathogenesis of this disease. Case presentation: We report a rare case of acute lymphocytic leukaemia with t(3;13)(q29, q21). The patient was diagnosed pre-B-ALL with no abnormal chromosomal or gene fusion and achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy; 10 months later, she relapsed in the consolidation, with cytogenetics tests showing 46, XX, t(3;13)(q29, q21). Given no CR after two chemotherapy regimens, the patient received salvage cord blood transplantation. Regular intrathecal methotrexate was applied to prevent central nervous system leukemia. Good graft versus leukemia was induced by daily injection of a low dose of IL-2 2 months post-transplantation. Minimal residual disease negativity was maintained until central nervous system (CNS) leukemia was found 8 months after transplantation. A whole exome sequencing was performed. Nine driver mutation genes and seven tumor genes were found. Conclusions: We highly suspect that the relapse in the CNS after transplantation is associated with a rare chromosomal translocation.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],"['Li, Xiaofan', 'Hong, Yaqun', 'Huang, Jiafu', 'Li, Nainong']","['Li X', 'Hong Y', 'Huang J', 'Li N']","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, P.R.

METHODS: Studies were searched through Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library, as well as conference abstracts (1 January 2000-2 June 2019). RESULTS: Overall, 12 and 17 primary studies were included in the HRQoL and economic burden reviews, respectively. Patients with CLL reported impairment in various quality of life domains when compared with healthy controls, including fatigue, anxiety, physical functioning, social functioning, depression, sleep disturbance, and pain interference. Key factors associated with a negative impact on the HRQoL burden of CLL included female gender, increased disease severity, and the initiation of multiple lines of therapy. Economic burden was assessed for patients with CLL based on disease status and the treatment regimen received. The main cost drivers related to CLL were outpatient and hospitalization-related costs, primarily incurred as a result of chemo/chemoimmunotherapy, adverse events (AEs), and disease progression. Treatment with targeted agents, i.e. ibrutinib and venetoclax, was associated with lower medical costs than chemoimmunotherapy, although ibrutinib was associated with some increased AE costs related to cardiac toxicities. Cost studies of targeted agents were limited by short follow-up times that did not capture the full scope of treatment costs. CONCLUSIONS: CLL imposes a significant HRQoL and economic burden. Our systematic review shows that an unmet need persists in CLL for treatments that delay progression while minimizing AEs. Studies suggest targeted therapies may reduce the economic burden of CLL, but longer follow-up data are needed.",,"['Waweru, Catherine', 'Kaur, Simarjeet', 'Sharma, Sheetal', 'Mishra, Namita']","['Waweru C', 'Kaur S', 'Sharma S', 'Mishra N']","['Health Economics, AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Parexel Access Consulting, Parexel International, Mohali, India.', 'Parexel Access Consulting, Parexel International, Mohali, India.', 'Parexel Access Consulting, Parexel International, Mohali, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200723,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*economic burden', '*health-related quality of life', '*medical economics', '*review']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2020.1784120 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2020 Sep;36(9):1481-1495. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2020.1784120.

There is accumulated evidence that FA is an etiological agent of leukemia development in humans. To develop a biomarker for FA exposure, we have, in this study, developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with stable isotope-dilution method to explore the reactivity of FA with glutathione (GSH) in physiologically relevant conditions. Interestingly, analysis of the reaction mixture by LC-MS/MS revealed exposure concentration- and duration-dependent formation of thioproline-glycine (SPro-Gly) produced by reaction of FA with cysteinyl-glycine (Cys-Gly) as a novel metabolite. Furthermore, dose-dependent formation of the thioproline adduct was observed in human cells separately exposed to FA and Fe(2+)-EDTA, a hydroxyl radical source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a thiazolidine carboxylic acid formed by reaction of FA and Cys-Gly is a major metabolite of FA. The results suggest a variety of GSH-derived thiazolidine metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers for FA and oxidative stress exposure, and the developed LC-MS/MS method provides a means for accurate determination of SPro-Gly as a dosimeter of oxidative stress and formaldehyde exposure.",,"['Pan, Guanrui', 'Ham, Yat-Hing', 'Chan, Ho Wai', 'Yao, Jing', 'Chan, Wan']","['Pan G', 'Ham YH', 'Chan HW', 'Yao J', 'Chan W']","['Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Mathematics, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200707,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,,,,,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00170 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2020 Jul 20;33(7):1989-1996. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00170.

This study investigates the use of neuro-fuzzy and group method of data handling, for the diagnosis of acute leukemia in children based on the complete blood count test. Furthermore, a principal component analysis is applied to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. The results show that distinguishing between patient and non-patient individuals can easily be done with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, whereas for classifying between the types of diseases themselves, more pre-processing operations such as reduction of features may be needed.

Emergence of side effects and noncompliance to therapy lead to reduced efficacy of medicines resulting in relapse of diseases. There is an increasing fact to support the incorporation of a pharmacist into clinical team due to their distinctive skills. Clinical oncology pharmacist with experience and specialized training in hematological cancers and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patient care has in-depth knowledge and skills of chemotherapy regimens including drug information, monitoring parameters of cancer treatment, dose adjustment, drug-drug interactions, adverse effects, and patient counseling skills. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The main objective of our study was to assess the significance of incorporation of clinical oncology pharmacist in ambulatory care in pediatric hematology-oncology and transplant clinic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was conducted at National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation hospital with duration of five months from 17 March 2019 to 16 July 2019. In this study the clinical oncology pharmacist was made available at ambulatory clinic of hematology-oncology and transplantation. The activities performed by a clinical oncology pharmacist were observed by resident BMT clinical pharmacist during the visits of patients and their families in a clinic. The BMT pharmacist is a clinical oncology pharmacist with experience and specialized training in hematological cancers and BMT patient care. Only pediatrics patients with beta thalassemia major and those who were on chemotherapy treatment and post-transplant patient were included in this study. RESULTS: During the five months' tenure, there were 1820 pediatric patients' visits in total. The clinical oncology pharmacist performed 980 direct patient interviews and documented 1665 pharmacist interventions. The majority of the documented clinical oncology pharmacist interventions were review of medication histories (n: 404, 24%) and ""deferiprone"" dose adjustments (n:400, 24%). Genomic profiling interventions were also among the commonly reported activities by the clinical oncology pharmacist. For beta thalassemia patients undergoing hydroxyurea therapy, the genomic profiling was performed to assess whether the hydroxyurea treatment is clinically effective or not (n:396, 23%). CONCLUSION: The involvement of clinical oncology pharmacist into a specialized outpatient clinic of hematology-oncology and transplant clinic plays an integral role in minimizing the adverse effect and reduction in readmission into the hospital. This is new expansion of pharmacist's role especially in underdeveloped country, considering the relevant clinical participation of clinical oncology pharmacist into specialized clinic revealing through optimized therapy and future prospect of clinical oncology pharmacist in pediatric hematology.",,"['Ali, Kashif', 'Al-Quteimat, Osama', 'Naseem, Rida', 'Malhi, Saima Mehmood', 'Wajdi, Mehwish', 'Jahan, Noor', 'Ansari, Saqib Hussain', 'Shamsi, Tahir Sultan']","['Ali K', 'Al-Quteimat O', 'Naseem R', 'Malhi SM', 'Wajdi M', 'Jahan N', 'Ansari SH', 'Shamsi TS']","['Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE.', 'National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Federal Urdu university of arts science and technology, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Children Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200706,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical oncology pharmacist', 'ambulatory care', 'hematology-oncology', 'transplant']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220934167 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Jun;27(4):815-820. doi: 10.1177/1078155220934167.

MicroRNA-7 has been shown to play a critical role in proliferation, migration, and treatment sensitivity in a diverse array of cancers. In this study, we sought to establish a novel link between microRNA-7 and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: To do so, we characterized gene expression of microRNA-7 as well as TAL1 in both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived tissue and cell lines, as well as performing functional luciferase assays to assess microRNA-7 binding to the TAL1 3'-untranslated region. We also performed growth, apoptosis, and migration experiments using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Annexin V, and transwell assays in the context of microRNA-7 overexpression. RESULTS: We found that microRNA-7 expression is attenuated and inversely correlated with TAL1 expression in TAL1 + T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Additionally, microRNA-7 directly targets and suppresses TAL1 levels. Finally, microRNA-7 overexpression reduces growth, motility, and migration while inducing apoptosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, phenotypes that can be rescued by concomitant overexpression of TAL1. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that microRNA-7 functions as a potent tumor suppressor by inhibiting the oncogene TAL1 and suggest microRNA-7 could function as a prognostic biomarker and possible therapeutic in the clinical management of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,"['Sun, Hongbo', 'Zhang, Zhifu', 'Luo, Wei', 'Liu, Junmin', 'Lou, Ye', 'Xia, Shengmei']","['Sun H', 'Zhang Z', 'Luo W', 'Liu J', 'Lou Y', 'Xia S']","[""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Longhua People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Longhua People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Longhua People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Longhua People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Daqing Oilfield General Hospital, Daqing, China.', ""Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Longhua People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,PMC7343363,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*TAL1', '*miR-7']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820934130 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820934130. doi: 10.1177/1533033820934130.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8404-4996'],20211124,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN7 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the correlation between differentially expressed proteins in serum and CP induced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in mice. We studied 80 mice in the following groups: male mice (male; n = 6), nonpregnant female control mice (NP-CRL; n = 6), healthy pregnant controls (P-CRL; Con; n = 24), pregnant mice with CP induced by atRA (n = 24), or pregnant mice with CP induced by TCDD (TCDD; n = 20). Pregnant mice were given with atRA (100 mg/kg) or TCDD (40 mug/kg), or corn oil by oral gavage at E10.5. The serum samples were collected and eight proteins-including interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-12p70, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-beta, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and epiregulin-were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Placental tissues were immunostained for IL-12p40 and RAGE from stages E13.5 to E16.5. In P-CRL mice, serum IL-12p40 was significantly increased at E13.5 and declined over E14.5-E16.5. P-CRL had lower IFN-gamma levels at E13.5 compared with NP-CRL. The CP groups showed lower concentrations of IL-12p40 at E13.5-E14.5 and clearly higher concentrations of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) at E13.5 when compared with P-CRL. IL-12p40 immunostaining clearly decreased in placental tissue sections obtained from E13.5 to E14.5 in both CP groups. These findings suggest that reduced levels of IL-12p40 and increased levels of sRAGE in serum may be correlated with chemically induced CP in mice, but further studies would be required to establish this.",,"['Wang, X-H', 'Peng, Y', 'Meng, L-Y']","['Wang XH', 'Peng Y', 'Meng LY']","[""The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology (Hubei-MOST) and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, School & Hospital of Stomatology, 499766Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology (Hubei-MOST) and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, School & Hospital of Stomatology, 499766Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology (Hubei-MOST) and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, School & Hospital of Stomatology, 499766Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200707,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cleft palate', 'IL-12p40', 'placental tissue', 'receptor for advanced glycation end products', 'serum']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0960327120937342 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2020 Dec;39(12):1661-1670. doi: 10.1177/0960327120937342.

It then searches for causal noncoding variants that may introduce aberrant transcription factor binding motifs or enhancer hijacking by structural variations. Analysis of 13 T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias identified a recurrent intronic variant predicted to cis-activate the TAL1 oncogene, a finding validated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of a patient-derived xenograft. Candidate oncogenes include the prolactin receptor PRLR activated by a focal deletion that removes a CTCF-insulated neighborhood boundary. cis-X may be applied to pediatric and adult solid tumors that are aneuploid and heterogeneous.

IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells (Th17) sustain MM cells growth and osteoclasts-dependent bone damage. In turn, Th17 differentiation relies on inflammatory stimuli. Here, we investigated the role of miR-21 in Th17-mediated MM tumor growth and bone disease. We found that early inhibition of miR-21 in naive T cells (miR-21i-T cells) impaired Th17 differentiation in vitro and abrogated Th17-mediated MM cell proliferation and osteoclasts activity. We validated these findings in NOD/SCID-g-NULL mice, intratibially injected with miR-21i-T cells and MM cells. A Pairwise RNAseq and proteome/phosphoproteome analysis in Th17 cells demonstrated that miR-21 inhibition led to upregulation of STAT-1/-5a-5b, STAT-3 impairment and redirection of Th17 to Th1/Th2 like activated/polarized cells.

To broaden use of CAR T cells in community clinics and in a frontline setting, we developed a novel CD8+ CAR T-cell product, Descartes-08, with predictable pharmacokinetics for treatment of multiple myeloma. Descartes-08 is engineered by mRNA transfection to express anti-BCMA CAR for a defined length of time. Descartes-08 expresses anti-BCMA CAR for 1 week, limiting risk of uncontrolled proliferation; produce inflammatory cytokines in response to myeloma target cells; and are highly cytolytic against myeloma cells regardless of the presence of myeloma-protecting bone marrow stromal cells, exogenous a proliferation-inducing ligand, or drug resistance including IMiDs. The magnitude of cytolysis correlates with anti-BCMA CAR expression duration, indicating a temporal limit in activity. In the mouse model of aggressive disseminated human myeloma, Descartes-08 induces BCMA CAR-specific myeloma growth inhibition and significantly prolongs host survival (p < 0.0001). These preclinical data, coupled with an ongoing clinical trial of Descartes-08 in relapsed/refractory myeloma (NCT03448978) showing preliminary durable responses and a favorable therapeutic index, have provided the framework for a recently initiated trial of an optimized/humanized version of Descartes-08 (i.e., Descartes-11) in newly diagnosed myeloma patients with residual disease after induction therapy.",,"['Lin, Liang', 'Cho, Shih-Feng', 'Xing, Lijie', 'Wen, Kenneth', 'Li, Yuyin', 'Yu, Tengteng', 'Hsieh, Phillip A', 'Chen, Hailin', 'Kurtoglu, Metin', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Andrew Stewart, C', 'Munshi, Nikhil', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu']","['Lin L', 'Cho SF', 'Xing L', 'Wen K', 'Li Y', 'Yu T', 'Hsieh PA', 'Chen H', 'Kurtoglu M', 'Zhang Y', 'Andrew Stewart C', 'Munshi N', 'Anderson KC', 'Tai YT']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'School of Biotechnology, Key Lab of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300457, PR China.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cartesian Therapeutics, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Cartesian Therapeutics, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Cartesian Therapeutics, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

Lessons from chronic myeloid leukemia.,2279-2284,10.1038/s41375-020-0957-z [doi],"Our concept of cancer latency, the interval from when a cancer starts until it is diagnosed, has changed dramatically. A prior widely-used definition was the interval between an exposure to a cancer-causing substance and cancer diagnosis. However, this definition does not accurately reflect current knowledge of how most cancers develop assuming, mostly incorrectly, one exposure is the sole cause of a cancer, ignoring the possibility the cancer being considered would have developed anyway but that the exposure accelerated cancer development and eliding the randomness in when a cancer is diagnosed. We show, using chronic myeloid leukaemia as a model, that defining cancer latency is not as simple as it once seemed. It is difficult or impossible to know at which event or mutation to start to clock to measure cancer latency. It is equally difficult to know when to stop the clock given the stochastic nature of when cancers are diagnosed. Importantly, even in genetically-identical twins with the same driver mutation intervals to develop cancer vary substantially. And we discuss other confonders. Clearly we need a new definition of cancer latency or we need to abandon the concept of cancer latency in the modern era of cancer biology.",,"['Abecasis, Manuel', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Brito, Manuel', 'Ferreira, Isabelina', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Score, Joannah', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Abecasis M', 'Cross NCP', 'Brito M', 'Ferreira I', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Hijiya N', 'Score J', 'Gale RP']","['Department of Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'School of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Hospital Pediatrico de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University, Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Haematology Research Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK. robertpetergale@alumni.ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200706,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0957-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0957-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Sep;34(9):2279-2284. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0957-z.

Here, we investigated whether FOXC1 regulates tumor dormancy and activation in the microenvironments of T and natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty cases of T and NK cell lymphomas were included; the immunohistochemical expression of FOXC1 was investigated in stromal cells, and numbers of FOXC1+ stromal cells were counted. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in tumor cells was investigated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: FOXC1 was variably expressed in C-X-C motif chemokine 12-associated reticular stromal cells, histiocytes, (myo)fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. The phenotypes of cases were categorized as dormant (high p-p38/low p-ERK1/2; n=30, 25.0%), active (high p-ERK1/2/low p-p38; n=25, 20.8%), or intermediate (others; n=65, 54.2%). Lower FOXC1+ stromal cell infiltration was associated with the dormant phenotype, the precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma subtype, and inferior overall survival rates, whereas higher FOXC1+ stromal cell infiltration was associated with the active phenotype and favorable patient prognosis (p < 0.05 for all).

We sought to identify small molecules that exhibit in vitro and in vivo efficacy against preclinical models of rhabdoid tumor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We screened eight rhabdoid tumor cell lines with 481 small molecules and compared their sensitivity with that of 879 other cancer cell lines. Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation screens in rhabdoid tumors were analyzed to confirm target vulnerabilities. Gene expression and CRISPR-Cas9 data were queried across cell lines and primary rhabdoid tumors to discover biomarkers of small-molecule sensitivity. Molecular correlates were validated by manipulating gene expression. Subcutaneous rhabdoid tumor xenografts were treated with the most effective drug to confirm in vitro results. RESULTS: Small-molecule screening identified the protein-translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (HHT), an FDA-approved treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as the sole drug to which all rhabdoid tumor cell lines were selectively sensitive. Validation studies confirmed the sensitivity of rhabdoid tumor to HHT was comparable with that of CML cell lines. Low expression of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2L1, which encodes Bcl-XL, was the strongest predictor of HHT sensitivity, and HHT treatment consistently depleted Mcl-1, the synthetic-lethal antiapoptotic partner of Bcl-XL. Rhabdoid tumor cell lines and primary-tumor samples expressed low BCL2L1, and overexpression of BCL2L1 induced resistance to HHT in rhabdoid tumor cells. Furthermore, HHT treatment inhibited rhabdoid tumor cell line and patient-derived xenograft growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Rhabdoid tumor cell lines and xenografts are highly sensitive to HHT, at least partially due to their low expression of BCL2L1. HHT may have therapeutic potential against rhabdoid tumors.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Howard, Thomas P', 'Oberlick, Elaine M', 'Rees, Matthew G', 'Arnoff, Taylor E',

We investigated secondary drivers of leukemogenesis in a mouse model of B-ALL driven by PU.1/Spi-B deletion (Mb1-CreDeltaPB). Whole-exome-sequencing analysis revealed recurrent mutations in Jak3 (encoding Janus kinase 3), Jak1, and Ikzf3 (encoding Aiolos). Mutations with a high variant-allele frequency (VAF) were dominated by C-->T transition mutations that were compatible with activation-induced cytidine deaminase, whereas the majority of mutations, with a low VAF, were dominated by C-->A transversions associated with 8-oxoguanine DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib delayed leukemia onset, reduced ROS and ROS-induced gene expression signatures, and altered ROS-induced mutational signatures.

In the first medical appointment, the CV risk factors should be identified to perform the baseline risk stratification, based on the Brazilian Guideline of Dyslipidemia and Atherosclerosis Prevention Update (risk levels: very high, high, intermediate and low). Once stratified, the treatment of the CV risk factors should be administered. If the patient presents risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, smoking and hypercholesterolemia, the evaluation and initial treatment may be done by the hematologist, being an option the request for evaluation by a specialist. If the patient has a history of previous CV disease, we recommend referral to a specialist. As the CV risk score is dynamic and the control of risk factors can reduce the patient risk, this expert consensus recommends that the re-evaluation of the CV risk after the baseline should be performed at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. After this period, it should be done annually and, for specific patients, at the clinician's discretion. The evaluation of the baseline CV risk and the safe administration of a TKI allow the patient to benefit from the maximum treatment, avoiding unwanted effects.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Cases of M. gordonae related infections in immunocompetent host have rarely been reported, and the pathogenicity of M. gordonae remained uncertain. METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2018, seven cases of M. gordonae infection were diagnosed and treated at National Taiwan University Hospital. RESULTS: Six cases had at least one underlying disease affecting immune status, while one case had no identifiable underlying disease. The sites of infection were lung (n = 3), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), and one had disseminated disease involving the lung and bone marrow. All patients were cured after anti-mycobacterial treatment, except one patient died of refractory leukemia. CONCLUSION: Compatible with the literature reports, we demonstrate that M. gordonae could be pathogenic and causing infection not only in the immunocompromised host, but also in the otherwise healthy population.

However, given the accelerating pace of drug development, there is a crucial need for in vivo preclinical models of human biology and pathology.

The development of immunodeficient mouse strains with high-level engraftment of normal and diseased human immune/hematopoietic cells has made in vivo functional characterization possible.

A significant number of elderly and frail people and those with underlying serious illness will continue to develop severe forms of the COVID-19 infection. Most of them are not eligible for intensive care treatment but can still expect palliative care - in many cases provided by a Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT). Several teams have already gained experience in caring for these patients and their families, others are preparing for it. METHOD: We report on a COVID-19 patient with pre-existing acute myeloid leukemia who was looked after by a HPCT until death. We discuss the challenges and difficulties while caring for COVID-19-positive palliative patients in a non-ICU setting. RESULTS: Hospitalization of the patient in an isolation ward caused an enormous burden for the dying patient and his family. Symptom control was particularly difficult because of rapid deteriorating dyspnea and the scarce presence of medical staff in the patient's room. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for ICU treatment may have a particularly high need for palliative care. Since beds in specialist palliative care units are limited, the HPCT should be prepared to care for these patients. They may offer support in decision-making, optimize symptom control, and provide psychosocial care for patients and their families. Visiting restrictions aimed to protect the general public must be weighted against the patient's and family's suffering.",,"['Anneser, Johanna']",['Anneser J'],"['Palliative Care Team, Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Editorial'],,England,Palliat Support Care,Palliative & supportive care,101232529,PMC7324302,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*Hospital Palliative Care Team', '*Symptom control', '*Visiting restrictions']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1017/S1478951520000450 [doi]', 'S1478951520000450 [pii]']",ppublish,Palliat Support Care. 2020 Aug;18(4):382-384. doi: 10.1017/S1478951520000450.,,4,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2563-0733'],20201123,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude to Death', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*mortality/*psychology', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/*psychology', 'Pandemics', 'Patient Care Team', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*mortality/*psychology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, no report is available on the clinical course of a severely immunocompromised patient with a dual E119D/R292K neuraminidase mutated-influenza A/H3N2 during the administration of peramivir. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old male patient was admitted for second allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for active acute leukemia. The patient received 5 mg prednisolone and 75 mg cyclosporine and had severe lymphopenia (70/muL). At the time of hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with upper tract influenza A virus infection, and oseltamivir treatment was initiated immediately. However, the patient was intolerant to oseltamivir. The following day, treatment was changed to peramivir. Despite a total period of neuraminidase-inhibitor administration of 16 days, the symptoms and viral shedding continued. Changing to baloxavir marboxil resolved the symptoms, and the influenza diagnostic test became negative. Subsequently, sequence analysis of the nasopharyngeal specimen revealed the dual E119D/R292K neuraminidase mutant influenza A/H3N2. CONCLUSIONS: In a highly immunocompromised host, clinicians should take care when peramivir is used for extended periods to treat influenza virus A/H3N2 infection as this could potentially leading to a dual E119D/R292K substitution in neuraminidase protein. Baloxavir marboxil may be one of the agents that can be used to treat this type of mutated influenza virus infection.",,"['Harada, Naonori', 'Shibata, Wataru', 'Koh, Hideo', 'Takashita, Emi', 'Fujisaki, Seiichiro', 'Okamura, Hiroshi', 'Nanno, Satoru', 'Yamada, Koichi', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Kakeya, Hiroshi']","['Harada N', 'Shibata W', 'Koh H', 'Takashita E', 'Fujisaki S', 'Okamura H', 'Nanno S', 'Yamada K', 'Nakamae H', 'Hino M', 'Kakeya H']","['Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Control Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Infectious Disease Sciences (RCIDS), Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan. hide_koh@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp.', 'Influenza Virus Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Influenza Virus Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Control Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Infectious Disease Sciences (RCIDS), Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Control Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Infectious Disease Sciences (RCIDS), Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200706,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC7339380,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Baloxavir marboxil', 'Dual E119D/R292K substitution', 'Immunocompromised host', 'Influenza A/H3N2', 'Neuraminidase mutation', 'Peramivir resistance']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/07/16 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-020-05205-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-020-05205-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Jul 6;20(1):478. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-05205-1.,,1,,20200715,"['0 (Acids, Carbocyclic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Dibenzothiepins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Thiepins)', '0 (Triazines)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)', '4G86Y4JT3F (baloxavir)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (NA protein, influenza A virus)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'QW7Y7ZR15U (peramivir)']",IM,"['Acids, Carbocyclic', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclopentanes/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dibenzothiepins', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/*drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Guanidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*genetics', 'Influenza, Human/*drug therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morpholines', 'Mutation', 'Neuraminidase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Oseltamivir/therapeutic use', 'Oxazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridones', 'Thiepins/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazines/*therapeutic use', 'Viral Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golden Retrievers appear predisposed, representing over 40% of TZL cases. Prior research found that asymptomatic aged Golden Retrievers frequently have populations of T zone-like cells (phenotypically identical to TZL) of undetermined significance (TZUS), potentially representing a pre-clinical state. These findings suggest a genetic risk factor for this disease and caused us to investigate potential genes of interest using a genome-wide association study of privately-owned U.S. Golden Retrievers. RESULTS: Dogs were categorized as TZL (n = 95), TZUS (n = 142), or control (n = 101) using flow cytometry and genotyped using the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip. Using a mixed linear model adjusting for population stratification, we found association with genome-wide significance in regions on chromosomes 8 and 14. The chromosome 14 peak included four SNPs (Odds Ratio = 1.18-1.19, p = .3 x 10(- 5)-5.1 x 10(- 5)) near three hyaluronidase genes (SPAM1, HYAL4, and HYALP1). Targeted resequencing of this region using a custom sequence capture array identified missense mutations in all three genes; the variant in SPAM1 was predicted to be damaging. These mutations were also associated with risk for mast cell tumors among Golden Retrievers in an unrelated study. The chromosome 8 peak contained 7 SNPs (Odds Ratio = 1.24-1.42, p = 2.7 x 10(- 7)-7.5 x 10(- 5)) near genes involved in thyroid hormone regulation (DIO2 and TSHR). A prior study from our laboratory found hypothyroidism is inversely associated with TZL risk. No coding mutations were found with targeted resequencing but identified variants may play a regulatory role for all or some of the genes. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of canine TZL may be related to hyaluronan breakdown and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory and pro-oncogenic byproducts. The association on chromosome 8 may indicate thyroid hormone is involved in TZL development, consistent with findings from a previous study evaluating epidemiologic risk factors for TZL. Future work is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.",,"['Labadie, Julia D', 'Elvers, Ingegerd', 'Feigelson, Heather Spencer', 'Magzamen, Sheryl', 'Yoshimoto, Janna', 'Dossey, Jeremy', 'Burnett, Robert', 'Avery, Anne C']","['Labadie JD', 'Elvers I', 'Feigelson HS', 'Magzamen S', 'Yoshimoto J', 'Dossey J', 'Burnett R', 'Avery AC']","['Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. jdlabadie@gmail.com.', 'Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA. jdlabadie@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Kaiser Permanente, Institute for Health Research, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200706,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,PMC7339439,['NOTNLM'],"['Dog', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-020-06872-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-020-06872-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2020 Jul 6;21(1):464. doi: 10.1186/s12864-020-06872-9.,"['DGE-1450032/National Science Foundation', 'T32CA094880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9942-7797'],20210319,"['0 (Receptors, Thyrotropin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian', 'Dog Diseases/*genetics', 'Dogs', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hypothyroidism/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/genetics/*veterinary', '*Mast Cells', 'Neoplasms, Connective Tissue/genetics/veterinary', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptors, Thyrotropin/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drugs were covalently bound to the peptide via an amide bond, methylenecarbonyl moiety, or a disulfide bridge. Conjugation of fluoroquinolones to TP10-NH2 resulted in congeners demonstrating antifungal in vitro activity against human pathogenic yeasts of the Candida genus (MICs in the 6.25 - 100 microM range), whereas the components were poorly active. The antibacterial in vitro activity of most of the conjugates was lower than the activity of CIP or LVX, but the antibacterial effect of CIP-S-S-TP10-NH2 was similar to the mother fluoroquinolone. Additionally, for two representative CIP and LVX conjugates, a rapid bactericidal effect was shown. Compared to fluoroquinolones, TP10-NH2 and the majority of its conjugates generated a relatively low level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60). The conjugates exhibited cytotoxicity against three cell lines, HEK293, HepG2 (human liver cancer cell line), and LLC-PK1 (old male pig kidney cells), with IC50 values in the 10 - 100 microM range and hemolytic activity. The mammalian toxicity was due to the intrinsic cytoplasmic membrane disruption activity of TP10-NH2 since fluoroquinolones themselves were not cytotoxic.

The aging population is one of the main risk factors for prostate and breast cancer development and accumulating studies link aging with epigenetic changes. Growth factor independence-1 (Gfi1) is a transcriptional repressor with an important role in human malignancies, including leukemia, colorectal carcinoma, and lung cancer, but its role in prostate and breast cancer is unknown. We have found that Gfi1 epigenetic silencing is a common event in prostate and breast cancer. Gfi1 re-expression in prostate and breast cancer cell lines displaying Gfi1 epigenetic silencing decreases cell proliferation, reduced colony formation density, and tumor growth in nude mice xenografts. In addition, we found that Gfi1 repress alpha 1-anti-trypsin (AAT) and alpha 1-anti-chymotrypsin (ACT) expression, two genes with important functions in cancer development, suggesting that Gfi1 silencing promotes tumor growth by increasing AAT and ACT expression in our system. Finally, Gfi1 epigenetic silencing could be a promising biomarker for prostate cancer progression because it is associated with shorter disease-free survival.

The pathogenesis of IBMFS involves mutations in several genes which encode for proteins involved in DNA repair, telomere biology and ribosome biogenesis. The classical IBMFS include Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). IBMFS are associated with high risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and solid tumors. Unfortunately, no specific pharmacological therapies have been highly effective for IBMFS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation provides a cure for aplastic or myeloid neoplastic complications. However, it does not affect the risk of solid tumors. Since approximately 28% of FA, 24% of SCN, 21% of DBA, 20% of SDS, and 17% of DC patients harbor nonsense mutations in the respective IBMFS-related genes, we discuss the use of the nonsense suppression therapy in these diseases. We recently described the beneficial effect of ataluren, a nonsense suppressor drug, in SDS bone marrow hematopoietic cells ex vivo. A similar approach could be therefore designed for treating other IBMFS. In this review we explain in detail the new generation of nonsense suppressor molecules and their mechanistic roles. Furthermore, we will discuss strengths and limitations of these molecules which are emerging from preclinical and clinical studies.

Quizartinib, a potent FLT3 inhibitor, induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-AML, while LY2510924 blocked surface CXCR4 without inducing apoptosis. LY2510924 significantly reversed stroma-mediated resistance against quizartinib mainly through the MAPK pathway. In mice with established FLT3-ITD-AML, LY2510924 induced durable mobilization and differentiation of leukemia cells, resulting in enhanced anti-leukemia effects when combined with quizartinib, whereas transient effects were seen on non-leukemic blood cells in immune-competent mice. Sequencing of the transcriptome of the leukemic cells surviving in vivo treatment with quizartinib and LY2510924 revealed that genes related to TGF-b signaling may confer resistance against the drug combination. In co-culture experiments of FLT3-ITD-AML and stromal cells, both silencing of TGF-b in stromal cells or TGF-b-receptor kinase inhibitor enhanced apoptosis by combined treatment.

Sanger sequencing identified 8/60 (13.5%) mutated cases, while ddPCR and the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR, used as a reference technique, identified mutations in 13/60 (21.6%) cases. When the outcome of IDH2-mutated was compared to that of wild-type patients, no significant difference in terms of quality of response, overall survival, or progression-free survival was observed. Finally, we monitored IDH2 mutations during follow-up in nine cases, finding that IDH2 can be considered a valid marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) in 2/3 of our patients. In conclusion, a rapid screening of IDH2 mutations is now a clinical need well satisfied by ddPCR, but the role of IDH2 as a marker for MRD still remains a matter of debate.",,"['Grassi, Susanna', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Ciabatti, Elena', 'Puccetti, Riccardo', 'Salehzadeh, Serena', 'Metelli, Maria Rita', 'Di Vita, Alessia', 'Domenichini, Cristiana', 'Caracciolo, Francesco', 'Orciuolo, Enrico', 'Pelosini, Matteo', 'Mazzantini, Elisa', 'Rossi, Pietro', 'Mazziotta, Francesco', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Galimberti, Sara']","['Grassi S', 'Guerrini F', 'Ciabatti E', 'Puccetti R', 'Salehzadeh S', 'Metelli MR', 'Di Vita A', 'Domenichini C', 'Caracciolo F', 'Orciuolo E', 'Pelosini M', 'Mazzantini E', 'Rossi P', 'Mazziotta F', 'Petrini M', 'Galimberti S']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (AOUP), 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (AOUP), 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (AOUP), 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (AOUP), 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (AOUP), 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (AOUP), 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200630,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC7407265,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CPX-351', 'Enasidenib', 'IDH2', 'MRD', 'digital PCR']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/07/08 06:01,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071738 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071738 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jun 30;12(7). pii: cancers12071738. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071738.,,7,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2719-2722', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7899-5966']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may occur at any extramedullary anatomic sites but is uncommon in the sinonasal location.MS commonly presents concurrently with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it may predate AML over several months or years, named isolated MS. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 15-month-old child who presented with mouth breathing, bilateral rhinorrhea, palpebral edema and proptosis. The routine blood tests were normal for the first few months. Computed tomography scan revealed neoplasm in nasal cavity. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was definitely diagnosed with isolated MS in the nasal cavity through immunohistochemistry combined with clinical features and radiological investigations, and MS further progressed to AML which was confirmed by hematologist. INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed to acquire specimens. After diagnosis, the patient was promptly treated with systemic chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: All symptoms gradually subsided and the mass of nasal cavity was invisible. No relapse occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Sinonasal MS may be misdiagnosed and should be considered when symptoms persist and worsen. Prompt clinic examinations are essential for cases with suspected MS. Diagnosis of MS is dependent on the immunohistological investigations combined with clinical features, radiological investigations. Early diagnosis and systemic chemotherapy are vital for patients to achieve best prognosis.",,"['Liu, Ruowu', 'Du, Jintao', 'Gao, Limin', 'Liu, Yafeng', 'Liu, Shixi']","['Liu R', 'Du J', 'Gao L', 'Liu Y', 'Liu S']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC7337411,,,,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/07/18 06:00,['2020/07/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000021119 [doi]', '00005792-202007020-00125 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Jul 2;99(27):e21119. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000021119.,,27,,20200717,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Diagnostic Errors/prevention & control', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema/etiology', 'Exophthalmos/etiology', 'Eyelid Diseases/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Nasal Cavity/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently special attention has been paid to the relationship of the WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16754 with AML risk and outcome, but the conflicting results made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using predefined search methodology for relevant studies. We pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to evaluate the association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk. In addition, we analyzed hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI for overall survive, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival. Q-statistic was used to assess the homogeneity and Egger test was used to evaluate publication bias. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The results of fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed no association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk (AA + GA vs GG: OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.71-1.19, P = .518; AA vs GA + GG: OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.86-1.76, P = .262; AA vs GG: OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.68-1.63, P = .820; AG vs AA: OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.53-1.13, P = .186; AG vs GG: OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.68-1.16, P = .376). In subgroup analysis by race, age, and disease type, we did not find any significant association. However, the presence of rs16754 GA/GG genotype was associated with improved overall survive (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.91, P = .024) and relapse-free survival (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-1.00, P = .048) compared with the rs16754 AA.

Methods: Cross sectional study. A total of 97 children who received 192 high-dose MTX treatments cycles in Lu Daopei Hospital from April to August 2019 were enrolled. The peripheral blood was collected at 0,24,48 h after the end of MTX infusion and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). One hundred and ninety-two MTX treatments were divided into a normal MTX elimination group (n=149) and delayed elimination group (n=43) according to the standard of delayed elimination and divided into 0-9 year old group (n=95), 10-14 group (n=50), 15-18 group (n=47) according to age. The comparisons of the C(MTX), C(7-OHMTX) between normal and delayed group was conducted as well as among different age groups. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of C(MTX-0h) and C(7-OHMTX-0h) was analyzed and the concentration corresponding to the maximum of the Youden index on the ROC was set as the warning value for delayed elimination. Correlation between the delayed elimination after the end of MTX infusion and toxicity was investigated and the percentage of delayed elimination was also analyzed. Results: The concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX were significantly higher in the delayed elimination group than the normal group. Immediately after infusion (0 h), a C(7-OHMTX-0h) of >17.8 mumol/L (sensitivity 97.7%, specificity 54.4%) and a C(MTX-0h) of >148.8 mumol/L (sensitivity 72.1%, specificity 84.6%) were found to be warning predictors of delayed elimination under the MTX treatment protocol. MTX delayed elimination was positively correlated with methotrexate-induced toxicities (r=0.58, P<0.01). The percentage of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity was 32.6% and 37.2% in the delayed elimination group, which was significantly higher than normal group of 12.8% and 3.4% (P<0.05). No significant difference was found in other toxicities. There was significant difference in C(MTX) among different age groups but no significant difference in C(7-OHMTX). Conclusion: Simultaneously determination of MTX and 7-OHMTX in plasma by HPLC-MS/MS in childhood ALL patients can provide a reference for clinical individualized medicine and pharmacokinetic research.",,"['Luo, G J', 'Wang, L', 'Hu, G F', 'Li, C B', 'Liu, H X', 'Peng, M T']","['Luo GJ', 'Wang L', 'Hu GF', 'Li CB', 'Liu HX', 'Peng MT']","['Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang 065201, China.', 'Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang 065201, China.', 'Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Drug monitoring', 'Leukemia, lymphoid', 'Methotrexate']",,2020/07/08 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200424-01305 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jul 7;100(25):1973-1978. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200424-01305.,"['81772254/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017YFC0910003/National Key Research and Development Program']",25,,20200716,"['X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the high price and nonavailability in low- and middle-income countries limits its use. In 2014, the first generic of pegaspargase (Hamsyl) was approved in India for use as a second-line treatment option for ALL. The aim of this study was to assess whether the generic pegaspargase (the test product) was bioequivalent with the reference product (Oncaspar). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was an open-label, parallel-group, comparative pharmacokinetic study in pediatric patients with relapsed ALL receiving their first dose (1,000 IU/m(2)) of pegaspargase administered intramuscularly. Patients were randomly assigned 1-to-1 to either the test or the reference product. The 2 formulations were considered equivalent if the 90% CIs for area under the plasma asparaginase activity-time curve (AUC0-t) geometric mean test-to-reference ratio was within 75% to 133%. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (6-18 years of age) were enrolled in this study, of whom 24 completed the study criteria and were considered for safety analysis (5 patients were ineligible for the assessment). Three patients were excluded from analysis, because of presence of anti-asparaginase antibodies, leaving 21 patients who were considered for bioequivalence pharmacokinetics data. The point estimate of AUC0-t for the test-to-reference ratio was 95.05 (90% CI, 75.07% to 120.33%). Maximum plasma concentration, trough concentrations (day 14), half-life, volume of distribution, drug clearance, and changes in the asparagine and glutamine levels were not significantly different between products. Adverse events were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Generic and reference pegaspargase had equivalent pharmacokinetics with comparable safety.

In the present study, we identified three methylation subtypes for AML samples based on the methylation profiles at CGI, CGI shore, CGI shelf, and opensea genomic contexts. Analyzing the molecular characteristics and clinical factors of the three subtypes revealed different methylation patterns and clinical outcomes between them. Further analysis revealed subtype dependent marker genes and their promoter CpG sites with regulatory function.

Cytogenetics-molecular risk, concurrent mutations, the type of FLT3 mutation (ITD vs TKD), the ITD allelic ratio, the type of HMA, age, prior exposure to HMA and receipt of prior allogeneic transplant did not independently impact response or leukemia-free survival (LFS). Concurrent IDH mutations were associated with lower CR/CRi (P = .01), while ASXL1 or TET2 mutations showed a non-significant association toward higher CR/CRi (P = .07, for both). However, none of the concurrent mutations were an independent predictor for response when adjusted to AML setting. In conclusion, VEN-HMA is associated with encouraging efficacy in FLT3m AML among both newly diagnosed unfit and r/r patients.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Mei, Matthew', 'Al Malki, Monzr M', 'Arslan, Shukaib', 'Ngo, Dat', 'Aribi, Ahmed', 'Ali, Haris', 'Sandhu, Karamjeet', 'Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Koller, Paul', 'Khaled, Samer', 'Artz, Andrew', 'Snyder, David', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Zhang J', 'Mei M', 'Al Malki MM', 'Arslan S', 'Ngo D', 'Aribi A', 'Ali H', 'Sandhu K', 'Salhotra A', 'Koller P', 'Khaled S', 'Artz A', 'Snyder D', 'Nakamura R', 'Forman SJ', 'Stein AS', 'Marcucci G', 'Pullarkat V']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200706,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,,2020/07/07 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25929 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jul 6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25929.,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9564-4498', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8226-471X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3830-5320', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9129-3424']",,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we integrated 199,219 drug sensitivity measurements for 397 unique anti-cancer drugs with genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screens in 484 cell lines to systematically investigate cellular drug mechanism-of-action. We observed an enrichment for positive associations between the profile of drug sensitivity and knockout of a drug's nominal target, and by leveraging protein-protein networks, we identified pathways underpinning drug sensitivity. This revealed an unappreciated positive association between mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCH5 dependency and sensitivity to MCL1 inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines. We also estimated drug on-target and off-target activity, informing on specificity, potency and toxicity. Linking drug and gene dependency together with genomic data sets uncovered contexts in which molecular networks when perturbed mediate cancer cell loss-of-fitness and thereby provide independent and orthogonal evidence of biomarkers for drug development. This study illustrates how integrating cell line drug sensitivity with CRISPR loss-of-function screens can elucidate mechanism-of-action to advance drug development.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2 H3 cells were cultured in vitro and Compound 48/80 was selected as positive drug. Real-time cell analysis(RTCA) system was used to detect the changes of cell index(CI) value after drug intervention. The degranulation of RBL-2 H3 cells was verified with the toluidine blue staining technology by observing the changes of cell morphology and skeleton. Clustering method was used to analyze the CI values of 15 batches of Zushima Injection on RBL-2 H3 cells. The results showed Compound 48/80(20 mug.mL~(-1)) significantly changed the cell morphology and cytoskeleton, with obvious degranulation. After adding Compound 48/80, CI value decreased rapidly within 30 minutes, then decreased slowly, suggesting that RTCA system can be used for rapid and sensitive evaluation of RBL-2 H3 cell degranulation. The results of cluster analysis showed that Zushima Injection from different manufacturers had different effects on RBL-2 H3 cells. S1-S8 and Compound 48/80 groups were grouped into one cluster, which suggesting that the sample might have potential clinical anaphylaxis. S9-S15 and the normal control group were grouped into one cluster, suggesting there was no anaphylactoid reaction in the sample.

A DCE can accommodate a limited number of attributes selected by researchers based on numerous factors (e.g., respondent comprehension, cognitive burden, and sample size). For situations where researchers want information about the possible impact of an attribute excluded from the DCE, we propose a method to use a question after the DCE. This follow-up question includes the attributes in the DCE with fixed levels and an additional attribute originally excluded from the DCE. The DCE data can be used to predict the probability that respondents would select one treatment profile over another without the additional attribute. Comparing the prediction to the percentage of the sample who selected each profile when it includes the additional attribute provides information on the potential impact of the additional attribute. We provide an example using data from a DCE on treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cost was excluded from the DCE, but the survey included a follow-up question with two fixed treatment profiles, similar to two treatments currently on the market, and a cost for each. Preferences were sensitive to modest changes in cost, highlighting the importance of gathering this information.","['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Mansfield, Carol', 'Sutphin, Jessie', 'Boeri, Marco']","['Mansfield C', 'Sutphin J', 'Boeri M']","['Health Preference Assessment, RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', 'Health Preference Assessment, RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', 'Health Preference Assessment, RTI Health Solutions, Belfast, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200706,England,Health Econ,Health economics,9306780,,['NOTNLM'],"['*discrete choice experiment', '*individual attribute estimates', '*preference analysis', '*share prediction']",,2020/07/07 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hec.4124 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Econ. 2020 Oct;29(10):1307-1315. doi: 10.1002/hec.4124.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors are nociceptors in cellular membrane which can perceive the stimuli of environmental irritant. The interaction between TRP channels and P2X7R has been found while the details about inflammation are still unclear. In this study, we suggested that transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a member of TRP superfamily, participates in ATP-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1)-derived macrophage. The co-localization between TRPA1 and P2X7R was detected using immunofluorescence in THP-1-derived macrophage and transfected human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T). The mechanism by which ATP or 3'-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) induces the activation of macrophages was verified by calcium imaging, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) detection, mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) measurement, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, CCK-8 assay, and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release cytotoxic assay. The BzATP and ATP induced calcium overload, mitochondria injury, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) secretion, and cytotoxicity can be inhibited by TRPA1 antagonists. These results indicated that TRPA1 can co-localize with P2X7R and mediate ATP-induced oxidative stress and inflammation.

Hybrid anticancer agents with dual effects have been reported to possess therapeutic potential to treat AML. However, the efficacy and underlying toxicity of these hybrids in combination with other agents remain unclear. NL101 is a novel hybrid formed by fusing the DNA damageinducing agent bendamustine with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. In the present study, NL101 treatment was combined with the conventional chemotherapeutic drug daunorubicin (DNR) in AML cells, and it was revealed that these two compounds exerted synergistic antiAML effects. In addition, NL101 enhanced DNRinduced cell apoptosis, as assessed by flow cytometry and as indicated by the upregulation of cleavedpoly (ADPribose) polymerase, cleavedcaspase3, cleavedcaspase7, BAD and BIM. Mechanistically, the DNA doublestrand breaks marker gammaH2AX, and other proteins associated with DNA damage, were investigated, and it was demonstrated that NL101 in combination with DNR synergistically promoted the DNA damage response. In vivo, this combination significantly delayed the progression of AML and prolonged the survival time in mice.

The prognosis of patients with highgrade glioma is poor. It is therefore crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as potential inducers or suppressors of tumor progression. Previous studies have indicated that the lncRNA Feline Leukemia Virus Subgroup C Cellular Receptor 1 Antisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1AS1) is involved in the development and progression of gastric and lung cancer, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma; however, the biological effect of FLVCR1AS1 in glioma is not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how FLVCR1AS1 modulates cell proliferation and invasion in glioma. FLVCR1AS1 expression was significantly upregulated in GBM tissues compared with adjacent normal brain samples, and was higher in GBM cell lines compared with normal human astrocyte cells. Furthermore, the microRNA (miR)30b3p was revealed to be a putative target of FLVCR1AS1, and the suppressive effects of miR30b3p on cellular proliferation and invasion were reversed following FLVCR1AS1knockdown. The results from Cell Counting Kit8 and Transwell assays confirmed that FLVCR1AS1knockdown inhibited GBM cell proliferation and invasion ability. In addition, FLVCR1AS1 was found to directly interact with miR30b3p, and a rescue experiment further established that FLVCR1AS1 contributed to glioma progression by inhibiting miR30b3p. The results from the present study demonstrated that FLVCR1AS1 may serve an oncogenic role in GBM and promote disease progression by interacting with miR30b3p. These findings suggested that FLVCR1AS1 may be considered as a novel therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker for GBM.",,"['Gao, Weida', 'Li, Hongbin', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Liu, Fei']","['Gao W', 'Li H', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao H', 'Liu F']","['Gamma Knife Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, P.R.

GINS2 is upregulated in a variety of aggressive tumors, such as leukemia, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. However, the role of GINS2 in pancreatic cancer has still remained elusive. In this study, PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines were chosen to perform experiments in vitro. Additionally, the effects of GINS2 interference on the cell viability, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumor growth in nude mice were analyzed. Methods: We utilized pancreatic cancer cell lines that knocked down GINS2 expression using small interference RNA (siRNA) and evaluated GINS2 expression using Western blot analysis. To explore the function of GINS2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro, MTT assay and flow cytometry were used. Additionally, we investigated the potential mechanism of GINS2 interference by identifying the MAPK/ERK pathway using Western blotting. Finally, PANC-1 cells with GINS2 knockdown were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to evaluate the effects of GINS2 on tumor growth in vivo. Results: It was unveiled that GINS2 interference inhibited cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and enhanced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Western blot assay indicated that GINS2 interference increased the expression level of Bax, while the expression level of Bcl-2 was remarkably decreased. In addition, the expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, and Cyclin D1 were significantly reduced after treatment with GINS2 siRNA. Furthermore, GINS2 interference drastically attenuated the expression levels of MEK, p-MEK, ERK, and p-ERK, belonging to the MAPK/ERK pathway. The results of an established cancer xenograft model revealed that nude mice transplanted with cells expressing negative control (NC) exhibited larger and heavier tumors, while volume and weight of tumor were remarkably reduced in ones transplanted with cells expressing GINS2 siRNA. Conclusions: GINS2 interference inhibited cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest, and promoted cell apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cell lines via the MAPK/ERK pathway, and our findings may be valuable for treating pancreatic cancer.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Zhang, Miao', 'He, Saifei', 'Ma, Xing', 'Ye, Ying', 'Wang, Guoyu', 'Zhuang, Juhua', 'Song, Yanan', 'Xia, Wei']","['Zhang M', 'He S', 'Ma X', 'Ye Y', 'Wang G', 'Zhuang J', 'Song Y', 'Xia W']","[""Central Laboratory, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200137, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200519,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,PMC7330693,['NOTNLM'],"['GINS2', 'MAPK/ERK pathway', 'Pancreatic cancer']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2020/07/07 06:00,2020/07/07 06:01,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.38386 [doi]', 'jcav11p4662 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 May 19;11(16):4662-4670. doi: 10.7150/jca.38386. eCollection 2020.,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a follow up, the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their residues (PPR Panel) was requested to investigate the plausible involvement of pesticide exposure as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and childhood leukaemia (CHL). A systematic literature review on PD and CHL and mode of actions for pesticides was published by EFSA in 2016 and used as background documentation. The Panel used the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) conceptual framework to define the biological plausibility in relation to epidemiological studies by means of identification of specific symptoms of the diseases as AO. The AOP combines multiple information and provides knowledge of biological pathways, highlights species differences and similarities, identifies research needs and supports regulatory decisions. In this context, the AOP approach could help in organising the available experimental knowledge to assess biological plausibility by describing the link between a molecular initiating event (MIE) and the AO through a series of biologically plausible and essential key events (KEs). As the AOP is chemically agnostic, tool chemical compounds were selected to empirically support the response and temporal concordance of the key event relationships (KERs). Three qualitative and one putative AOP were developed by the Panel using the results obtained. The Panel supports the use of the AOP framework to scientifically and transparently explore the biological plausibility of the association between pesticide exposure and human health outcomes, identify data gaps, define a tailored testing strategy and suggests an AOP's informed Integrated Approach for Testing and Assessment (IATA).","['(c) 2017 European Food Safety Authority.

The median age at diagnosis was 43 years, and 80% were less than 60 years old; 75% of patients were male. Cytogenetic analysis was integrated into the World Health Organization 2008 classification and showed that the percentages of normal and abnormal karyotypes were similar, accounting for 48.4% of each group of patients. The AML risk stratification based on cytogenetic analysis resulted in the following distribution: 18% in the favorable risk group, 57% in the intermediate-risk group, 24% in the unfavorable risk group, and 1% unknown. Only 88 patients received therapy with curative intent; 67% achieved complete remission, increasing to 81% after inductions 1 and 2. The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in AML patients were 26.6 and 19.5 months, respectively. The 3-year OS and DFS were 40 and 36%, respectively. Prognostic factors including age, gender, white blood cell count, and risk stratification were not significantly associated with treatment outcomes, whereas response to treatment vs. failure was significantly associated with the outcome (p = 0.01). The current study supports the importance of cytogenetics as a useful tool in diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment in AML treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2020 El Omri, Taha, Elomri, Kacem, Elsabah, Ellahie, Gamil,', 'Ibrahim, Soliman, El Akiki, Nawaz, Al Sabbagh and El Omri.']","['El Omri, Halima', 'Taha, Ruba Yasin', 'Elomri, Adel', 'Kacem, Nancy', 'Elsabah, Hesham', 'Ellahie, Anil Yousaf', 'Gamil, Amna', 'Ibrahim, Firyal', 'Soliman, Dina Sameh Abdelrahman', 'El Akiki, Susanna Jane Lawson', 'Nawaz, Zafar', 'Al Sabbagh, Ahmad', 'El Omri, Abdelfatteh']","['El Omri H', 'Taha RY', 'Elomri A', 'Kacem N', 'Elsabah H', 'Ellahie AY', 'Gamil A', 'Ibrahim F', 'Soliman DSA', 'El Akiki SJL', 'Nawaz Z', 'Al Sabbagh A', 'El Omri A']","['Medical Oncology-Hematology Department, National Centre for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Medical Oncology-Hematology Department, National Centre for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Division of Engineering Management and Decision Sciences, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Clinical Pharmacy, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Medical Oncology-Hematology Department, National Centre for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Medical Oncology-Hematology Department, National Centre for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Medical Oncology-Hematology Department, National Centre for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Cytogenetic and Molecular Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Cytogenetic and Molecular Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Center of Excellence in Bionanoscience Research and Genomics and Biotechnology Section and Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7313235,['NOTNLM'],"['Qatar', 'WHO classification of AML', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cytogenetic', 'remission', 'survival']",,2020/07/07 06:00,2020/07/07 06:01,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.00553 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Jun 17;11:553. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00553. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11 A (BCL11A), as a transcription factor, is oncogenic in several neoplasms. However, its function in NKTL remains unclear. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to measure the BCL11A expression levels among NKTL patients and in NKTL cell lines. Natural killer (NK) cells from healthy subjects were used as negative control. Transient transfection with small interfering RNA was used to knockdown the expression in NKTL cell lines. Samples and clinical histories were collected from 343 NKTL patients (divided into test and validation groups) to evaluate the clinical value of BCL11A expression level. The BCL11A expression was upregu\lated among NKTL patients and in NKTL cell lines. Reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis were observed after silencing BCL11A in NKTL cell lines. BCL11A expression level was correlated with RUNX3, c-MYC, and P53 in NKTL. Notably, a high BCL11A expression was correlated with unfavorable clinical characteristics and predicted poor outcomes in NKTL. In conclusion, BCL11A was overexpressed in NKTL, while its upregulation promoted tumor development. Therefore, BCL11A expression level may be a promising prognostic biomarker for NKTL.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Shi, Li, Feng, Yue, Song, Peng and Wang.']","['Shi, Hongyun', 'Li, Chun', 'Feng, Wei', 'Yue, Jianjun', 'Song, Jingfang', 'Peng, Aizhi', 'Wang, Hua']","['Shi H', 'Li C', 'Feng W', 'Yue J', 'Song J', 'Peng A', 'Wang H']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200604,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC7311857,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 11A', 'gene expression', 'natural killer/T-cell lymphoma', 'oncogenic', 'prognosis']",,2020/07/07 06:00,2020/07/07 06:01,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.00820 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Jun 4;11:820. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00820. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several organs are commonly examined in such studies to evaluate the disease course, the effectiveness of interventions and the localization of tumor cells in the affected organs are still unclear. In this study, we histologically examined the distribution of leukemia cells in several organs using two leukemic mouse models produced by the administration of two cell lines (THP-1, a human myelomonocytic leukemia, and A20, a mouse B cell leukemia/lymphoma) to severe immunodeficient mice. Survival of the mice depended on the tumor burden. Although A20 and THP-1 tumor cells massively infiltrated the parenchyma of the liver and spleen at 21 days after transplantation, A20 cells were hardly found in connective tissues in Glisson's capsule in the liver as compared with THP-1 cells. In the bone marrow, there was more severe infiltration of A20 cells than THP-1 cells. THP-1 and A20 cells were widely spread in the lungs, but were rarely observed in the small intestine.

Overexpression of importins and exportins is reported in many malignancies, with implications in cell growth and viability, differentiation, drug resistance, and tumor microenvironment. Given their broad significance across tumors and pathways, much effort is being put to develop specific inhibitors as a novel anticancer therapeutics. Already, selinexor, a specific inhibitor of exportin-1 (XPO1), is approved for clinical use. This review will focus on the role of importins and exportins in hematological malignancies.

Besides the preexisting platelet disorder in FPD/AML patients, AML also develops in 20-60% of affected individuals. Since its discovery by the Gilliland group in 1999, RUNX1 mutation in the germline has been extensively investigated in the field. The past two decades of research have taught us three important lessons: 1) patients with FPD/AML display atypical symptoms and they have a widened clinical spectrum of FPD, such as eczema and syndromic thrombocytopenia, 2) the elucidation of variant of uncertain significance (VUS) of RUNX1 have revealed their role in epigenetic functions and involvement in the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, and 3) non-coding mutations of RUNX1 also causes FPD/AML. In three distinct familial cases, an enhancer for RUNX1, eR1, was either lost or disconnected from the promoter through genetic deletion or chromosomal translocation abnormalities.

The mechanisms by which SF3B1 mutations promote malignancy are poorly understood. Here, we integrated pan-cancer RNA sequencing to identify mutant SF3B1-dependent aberrant splicing events with a positive CRISPR screen to prioritize alterations that functionally promote oncogenesis. Our results indicated that diverse, recurrent SF3B1 mutations converge on the repression of bromodomain containing 9 (BRD9), a core component of the recently described non-canonical barrier-to-autointegration factor complex (ncBAF). Mutant SF3B1 recognizes intronic sequences within BRD9 as exons, thereby permitting inclusion of aberrant sequence (i.e., poison exon) that will result in the degradation of BRD9 mRNA. BRD9 depletion results in significant loss of ncBAF at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding loci but has no impact on the localization of canonical BAF. These actions resulted in disturbed myeloid/erythroid differentiation and promoted the development of MDS and melanoma. Of note, correcting BRD9 mis-splicing in SF3B1-mutant cells with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), by targeting the poison exon with CRISPR-directed mutagenesis, or via the use of spliceosomal inhibitors are all potential therapeutic options.

In particular, we have determined an important pathogenic role of cross-talk between altered epigenetic state and pre-mRNA splicing, provided functional evidence that mutations in pre-mRNA splicing factors drive leukemia development, and uncovered spliceosomal changes as a novel mediator of IDH2 mutant leukemogenesis. By isolating specific pre-mRNA splicing events that functionally contribute to IDH2/SRSF2 double-mutant leukemogenesis, we found that loss of the Integrator complex plays an important role in leukemia development. Our studies provided new evidence that defects in the Integrator complex remarkably affect several gene expression programs associated with hematopoietic differentiation and signaling pathways via transcriptional pause-release dysregulation, blockade of myeloid differentiation, and promotion of leukemogenesis in the Idh2 mutant background in vivo.

This price should not be judged in isolation but rather evaluated in the context of clinical benefit, which can be assessed by cost-effectiveness analyses such as the total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Physicians change drugs several times to prolong individual patient survival over the course of their therapy, which means there are variations in treatment choices and treatment sequence. To achieve a clinical response by each treatment is very important, and the overall response rate and OS are key pieces of information to assess this. The additional treatment goal is sustained minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity. In Japan, medical costs for MM are mostly covered by public health insurance. Modifications in treatment patterns for CML and MM drugs and medical costs for patients are important issues; how to cure the disease or prolong the therapy-free interval with lower costs is an urgent requirement. Total medical costs have remained stable since 2010, but there are important issues to consider in the use of generic drugs, Phase 2 approval of new drugs, and decreasing costs of other care, particularly for hospitalization that includes treatment costs other than that of CML and MM drugs. We must aim for treatment-free remission and a clinical cure in the future. We can stop treatment with a 2-year sustained molecular response (MR)(4.5) in CML and MRD negative (<10(-5)) in MM with full informed consent and careful watch by the BCR-ABL international scale and next-generation flow.",,"['Suzuki, Kenshi']",['Suzuki K'],"['Myeloma/Amyloidosis Center, Japanese Red Cross Medical Center.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,['NOTNLM'],"['Health technology assessment', 'Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Quality-adjusted life years']",,2020/07/07 06:00,2020/07/16 06:00,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.61.587 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2020;61(6):587-597. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.61.587.,,6,,20200715,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Economics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Japan', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to explore the neuroprotective role of Pim-1 in a rat model subjected to optic nerve crush (ONC), and discuss its related molecules in improving the intrinsic regeneration ability of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Immunofluorescence staining showed that AAV2- Pim-1 infected 71% RGCs and some amacrine cells in the retina. Real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that retina infection with AAV2- Pim-1 up-regulated the Pim-1 mRNA and protein expressions compared with AAV2-GFP group. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining, gamma-synuclein immunohistochemistry, Cholera toxin B (CTB) tracing and TUNEL showed that RGCs transduction with AAV2-Pim-1 prior to ONC promoted the survival of damaged RGCs and decreased cell apoptosis. RITC anterograde labeling showed that Pim-1 overexpression increased axon regeneration and promoted the recovery of visual function by pupillary light reflex and flash visual evoked potential. Western blotting showed that Pim- 1 overexpression up-regulated the expression of Stat3, p-Stat3, Akt1, p-Akt1, Akt2 and p-Akt2, as well as betaIII-tubulin, GAP-43 and 4E-BP1, and downregulated the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, Cleaved caspase 3, Bad and Bax. These results demonstrate that Pim-1 exerted a neuroprotective effect by promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery of RGCs. In addition, it enhanced the intrinsic regeneration capacity of RGCs after ONC by activating Stat3, Akt1 and Akt2 pathways, and inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. These findings suggest that Pim-1 may prove to be a potential therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of optic nerve injury.",,"['Zhang, Shoumei', 'Shuai, Li', 'Wang, Dong', 'Huang, Tingting', 'Yang, Shengsheng', 'Miao, Mingyong', 'Liu, Fang', 'Xu, Jiajun']","['Zhang S', 'Shuai L', 'Wang D', 'Huang T', 'Yang S', 'Miao M', 'Liu F', 'Xu J']","['Department of Anatomy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120, China.', 'Department of Health Administration, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Exp Neurobiol,Experimental neurobiology,101278187,PMC7344373,['NOTNLM'],"['Nerve regeneration', 'Optic nerve injury', 'Pim-1', 'Retinal ganglion cell']",,2020/07/07 06:00,2020/07/07 06:01,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['en20019 [pii]', '10.5607/en20019 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurobiol. 2020 Jun 30;29(3):249-272. doi: 10.5607/en20019.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of novel agents, together with autologous stem cell transplantation, has improved survival outcome in PPCL. However, the prognosis is still very poor, and the optimal treatment remains an unmet clinical need. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the efficacy and prognostic impact of novel agents in 46 patients with PPCL patients at the Blood Diseases Hospital in China. We examined the impact of clinical and laboratory features, as well as therapies (bortezomib- and/or immunomodulatory drug-based therapies, chemotherapy) on survival and extent of clinical response, including progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival and OS were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival distributions were compared by log-rank test. RESULTS: In our cohort of 46 PPCL patients, the median age at the time of diagnosis was 54 years. Overall response rate was 54% (25/46). The median (95% confidence interval) progression-free survival time was 6 (0-12.5) months, and OS time was 14 (4.6-23.4) months. The OS time was significantly longer in patients treated with bortezomib-based versus non-bortezomib-based therapies (median [95% confidence interval], 19 [9-28.9] vs. 5 [4-24] months; P = .019).

Approval was based on the phase III RESPONSE trial, which demonstrated efficacy in a highly selected patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To characterize the tolerability and outcomes of ruxolitinib outside of a clinical trial, we performed a multi-center retrospective analysis of patients with PV treated with ruxolitinib at 11 participating sites across the United States. Outcomes of interest included change in phlebotomy requirements after starting ruxolitinib and spleen response, as these were included in the primary composite outcome in the RESPONSE trial. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients met eligibility criteria, and the median duration of follow-up was 22.4 months (range, 0-63.0 months). At 32 weeks after starting ruxolitinib, the percentage of patients who received at least 1 phlebotomy was significantly decreased compared with before ruxolitinib (37% vs. 56%; relative risk [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.84; P < .001). Phlebotomy requirements were similarly decreased in patients who had received at least 3 phlebotomies prior to ruxolitinib initiation (28% vs. 17%; RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.13-2.40; P < .01). Resolution of palpable splenomegaly was also documented (48% vs. 20%; RR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.70-3.53; P < .0001). A total of 9.5% of patients discontinued ruxolitinib owing to treatment-emergent adverse events, and 81.7% of patients were receiving ruxolitinib at last known follow-up. CONCLUSION: These real-world results are similar to those reported from the RESPONSE trial, although additional follow-up is necessary to assess long-term outcomes and potential for late-onset toxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, cases of drug resistance are constantly emerging due to various mutations in the ABL kinase domain; thus, it is crucial to identify novel bioactive analogues. Reliable QSAR models and molecular docking protocols have been shown to facilitate the discovery of new compounds from chemical libraries prior to experimental testing. However, as the vast majority of QSAR models strictly relies on 2D descriptors, the rise of 3D descriptors directly computed from molecular dynamics simulations offers new opportunities to potentially augment the reliability of QSAR models. Herein, we employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics on a large series of Imatinib derivatives and developed an ensemble of QSAR models relying on deep neural nets (DNN) and hybrid sets of 2D/3D/MD descriptors in order to predict the binding affinity and inhibition potencies of those compounds. Through rigorous validation tests, we showed that our DNN regression models achieved excellent external prediction performances for the pKi data set (n = 555, R(2) >/= 0.71. and MAE </= 0.85), and the pIC50 data set (n = 306, R(2) >/= 0.54. and MAE </= 0.71) with strict validation protocols based on external test sets and 10-fold native and nested cross validations. Interestingly, the best DNN and random forest models performed similarly across all descriptor sets. In fact, for this particular series of compounds, our external test results suggest that incorporating additional 3D protein-ligand binding site fingerprint, descriptors, or even MD time-series descriptors did not significantly improve the overall R(2) but lowered the MAE of DNN QSAR models. Those augmented models could still help in identifying and understanding the key dynamic protein-ligand interactions to be optimized for further molecular design.",,"['Kyaw Zin, Phyo Phyo', 'Borrel, Alexandre', 'Fourches, Denis']","['Kyaw Zin PP', 'Borrel A', 'Fourches D']","['Department of Chemistry, Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200705,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,,,,,2020/07/07 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/07 06:00'],"['2020/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00200 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2020 Jul 27;60(7):3342-3360. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00200.

Although CEBPA mutations are found in more than 10% in AML, functional inhibition of C/EBPalpha protein is also widely observed in AML. Here, we sought to examine if SKP2, an aberrantly enhanced E3 ubiquitin ligase in primary AMLs inhibits C/EBPalpha stability to induce differentiation block. MAIN METHODS: Here we employed cell based assays such as transfections, immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, luciferase and gel shift assays along with differentiation assays to investigate SKP2 regulated C/EBPalpha protein stability in acute myeloid leukemia. KEY FINDINGS: Here we discovered that oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(skp2) ubiquitinates and destabilizes C/EBPalpha in a proteasome-dependent manner. Our data demonstrates that SKP2 physically interacts with C-terminal of C/EBPalpha and promotes its K48-linked ubiquitination-mediated degradation leading to its reduced transactivation potential, DNA binding ability and cellular functions. We further show that while overexpression of SKP2 inhibits both ectopic as well as endogenous C/EBPalpha in heterologous (HEK293T) as well as myeloid leukemia cells respectively, SKP2 depletion restores endogenous C/EBPalpha leading to reduced colony formation and enhanced myeloid differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Using Estradiol-inducible K562-C/EBPalpha-ER cells as yet another model of granulocytic differentiation, we further confirmed that SKP2 overexpression indeed inhibits granulocytic differentiation by mitigating C/EBPalpha stability. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings identify SKP2 as a potential negative regulator of C/EBPalpha stability and function in AML which suggests that SKP2 can be potentially targeted in AML to restore C/EBPalpha and overcome differentiation block.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Nonetheless, not all patients benefit from such therapies because they fail to achieve complete responses, suffer frequent relapses, or develop potentially life-threatening toxicities. Epigenomic signatures in immune and cancer cells appear to be accurate and promising predictors of patient outcomes with immunotherapy. In addition, combined treatments with epigenetic drugs can exploit the dynamic nature of epigenetic changes to potentially modulate responses to immunotherapy. Candidate epigenetic biomarkers may provide a rationale for patient stratification and precision medicine, thus maximizing the chances of treatment success while minimizing unwanted effects. We present a comprehensive up-to-date view of potential epigenetic biomarkers in immunotherapy and discuss their advantages over other indicators.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

We hypothesized lymphatic fluid collected from the thoracic duct of children would serve as a unique reservoir for early T cells, which could then be used for CAR T-cell therapy. METHODS: We evaluated lymphatic fluid collected from 25 pediatric patients undergoing thoracic duct cannulation for other clinical indications. RESULTS: Lymphatic fluid in the thoracic duct was rich in T cells, with higher percentage of naive and stem central memory T-cell subsets compared with paired blood samples. T cells from lymphatic fluid showed decreased negative checkpoint regulators on the surface and increased rapid expansion with bead activation. Creation of CD19-directed CAR T cells from blood and lymphatic T cells showed similar lentiviral transduction properties, but CAR T cells generated from lymphatic fluid produced superior cytotoxicity in a murine leukemia model because they were able to achieve equivalent tumor eradication at lower doses. CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first characterization of T cells from the thoracic duct of pediatric patients and suggest an alternative approach for manufacturing of cellular therapy that will improve both expansion and cytotoxic effect.","['Copyright (c) 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.

However, the regulatory mechanism of TRIB3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms and uncover the functions of TRIB3 in AML. METHODS: Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze the expression levels of TRIB3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), apoptosis markers and autophagy markers in AML cells. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell apoptosis. The interaction of TRIB3 and PPARalpha was evaluated by immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and in vivo ubiquitination assays. KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrated that downregulating TRIB3 in leukemic cells effectively induced apoptosis and autophagy by regulating the degradation of PPARalpha. Mechanistically, TRIB3 interacted with PPARalpha and contributed to its destabilization by promoting its ubiquitination. When PPARalpha was activated by its specific agonist clofibrate, the apoptosis and autophagy of AML cells were significantly enhanced. These results were confirmed by rescue experiments. Blocking PPARalpha expression using the PPARalpha inhibitor GW6471 reversed the functional influence of TRIB3 on AML cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The aim of this study is to provide evidence of the degradation of PPARalpha by TRIB3 via ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. This process meditates the progression of AML and prolongs the survival of leukemic cells. As a result, these data indicate that TRIB3 is a novel and promising therapeutic target for AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study was to examine the miRNA expression profile in seminal EVs and inquire into the relation between it and the vertical transmission by performing gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis. Here, we first isolated and characterized seminal EVs by Nanoparticle Tracking AnalysisWestern Blot and Transmission electron microscopy experiments. By deep sequencing of each EVs miRNA library, 9 typical differentially expressed miRNA, including 6 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated, were identified. Gene target prediction, GO annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed possible function associated with these miRNAs.

It has been described in normal tissues and in a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic lesions such as Rosai-Dorfman disease, tumors, hematopoietic disorders and rarely lymphomas. Emperipolesis by mesothelial cells is rare. Few cases of mesothelial emperipolesis of neoplastic lymphocytes in pleural effusions involved by lymphomas have been reported in the literature. Its etiopathogenesis and significance are controversial and speculative. We report a case of a 36-year-old man who presented with cough, chest pain, breathing difficulty, pericardial, and bilateral pleural effusions secondary to mediastinal T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Pleural fluid cytology slides and cell block sections showed numerous single dispersed neoplastic lymphoblasts with occasional giant multinucleated mesothelial cells with emperipolesis of lymphocytes. The background showed scattered and clumped apoptotic karyorrhexis debris and reactive mesothelial cells. Cell block immunohistochemistry showed CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD99, and TdT positive lymphocytes, consistent with involvement by T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. The giant cells were positive for cytokeratin, calretinin and WT1 confirming their mesothelial origin. Lymphoid effusions with emperipolesis may raise a potential diagnostic pitfall because they may morphologically be confused with other inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. This cell-in-cell phenomenon can be a helpful clue in the differential diagnosis of lymphocyte-rich effusions since it has been described in association with lymphomas. It might shed some light on the lymphocyte-mesothelial interaction and the potential phagocytic antigen-presenting properties of mesothelial cells under certain circumstances.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['AbdullGaffar, Badr']",['AbdullGaffar B'],"['Pathology Section, Rashid Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200704,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,['NOTNLM'],"['emperipolesis', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'lymphocytes', 'mesothelial cells', 'pleural effusion']",,2020/07/06 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2020/07/05 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dc.24543 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2020 Dec;48(12):E22-E26. doi: 10.1002/dc.24543.

In addition, the significant increase in comet assay parameters of zebrafish hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner indicated BDE-47 and BDE-153 induced DNA damage, probably due to observed oxidative stress.

However, its interaction with vincristine may induce neuropathy and the emergence of antifungal drug resistance contributes to substantial mortality caused by invasive fungal infections (IFIs). In a retrospective single-centre study, we compared tolerability and outcome of different antifungal prophylaxis strategies in 198 children with acute leukaemia (median age 5.3 years). Until 2010, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole was offered to most of the patients and thereafter was replaced by liposomal amphotericin-B (L-AMB) and restricted to high-risk patients only. Vincristine-induced neurotoxicity was significantly reduced under L-AMB, as the percentage of patients with severe constipation decreased (15.4% vs. 3.7%, before vs. after 31 December.2010, P = 0.01) and stool frequency increased by up to 38% in polyene-treated patients (P = 0.005). Before 2011, 10 patients developed confirmed IFIs, most of them were infected with Aspergillus species. After risk adaption in 2011, IFIs were completely prevented (P = 0.007). L-AMB prophylaxis is beneficial in childhood leukaemia patients, as it offers effective antifungal activity with improved tolerability as compared to fluconazole. The potential impact of our risk-adapted antifungal treatment should be included in current prophylaxis guidelines for childhood leukaemia.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Among their functions is the regulation of hematopoiesis. They characterize the different stages of hematopoiesis in a more lineage-restricted expression pattern than coding mRNAs. They affect hematopoietic stem cell renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of committed progenitors by interacting with master regulators transcription factors. Among these transcription factors, MYC has a prominent role. Similar to MYC's transcriptional activation/amplification of protein coding genes, MYC also regulates lncRNAs' expression profile, while it is also regulated by lncRNAs. Both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies are prone to the association of MYC with lncRNAs. Such interaction inhibits apoptosis, enhances cell proliferation, deregulates metabolism, and promotes genomic instability and resistance to treatment.

Gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities are usually associated with aberrant proliferation and/or block in the normal differentiation of hematopoietic cells. So far, the combination of cytogenetic profiling and molecular and gene mutation analyses remains an essential tool for the classification, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for AML. This review gives an overview on how the development of novel innovative technologies has allowed us not only to detect the genetic alterations as early as possible but also to understand the molecular pathogenesis of AML to develop novel targeted therapies. We also discuss the remarkable advances made during the last decade to understand the AML genome both at primary and relapse diseases and how genetic alterations might influence the distinct biological groups as well as the clonal evolution of disease during the diagnosis and relapse. Also, the review focuses on how the persistence of epigenetic gene mutations during morphological remission is associated with relapse. It is suggested that along with the prognostic and therapeutic mutations, the novel molecular targeted therapies either approved by FDA or those under clinical trials including CART-cell therapy would be of immense importance in the effective management of AML.",,"['Kirtonia, Anuradha', 'Pandya, Gouri', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Pandey, Amit Kumar', 'Das, Bhudev C', 'Garg, Manoj']","['Kirtonia A', 'Pandya G', 'Sethi G', 'Pandey AK', 'Das BC', 'Garg M']","['Amity Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Research (AIMMSCR), Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, 201313, India.', 'Amity Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Research (AIMMSCR), Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, 201313, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117600, Singapore.', 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology (AIB), Amity University, Gurgaon, Haryana, 122413, India.', 'Amity Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Research (AIMMSCR), Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, 201313, India.', 'Amity Institute of Molecular Medicine and Stem Cell Research (AIMMSCR), Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, 201313, India. mgarg@amity.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200703,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*BRD4', '*CAR T cell therapy', '*Clonal evolution/clonal heterogeneity', '*Epigenetic mutations', '*Hedgehog', '*LSD1', '*Mutations', '*Preleukemic mutations', '*Small molecule inhibitors', '*XPO1']",,2020/07/06 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/07/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00109-020-01944-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00109-020-01944-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2020 Aug;98(8):1069-1091. doi: 10.1007/s00109-020-01944-5.

Here, we report the molecular mechanisms by which NUP98-PHF23 recognizes the histone mark H3K4me3 and is inhibited by small molecule compounds, including disulfiram that directly targets the PHD finger of PHF23 (PHF23PHD). Our data support a critical role for the PHD fingers of NUP98-PHF23, and related NUP98-KDM5A and NUP98-BPTF fusions in driving leukemogenesis, and demonstrate that blocking this interaction in NUP98-PHF23 expressing AML cells leads to cell death through necrotic and late apoptosis pathways. An overlap of NUP98-KDM5A oncoprotein binding sites and H3K4me3-positive loci at the Hoxa/b gene clusters and Meis1 in ChIP-seq, together with NMR analysis of the H3K4me3-binding sites of the PHD fingers from PHF23, KDM5A and BPTF, suggests a common PHD finger-dependent mechanism that promotes leukemogenesis by this type of NUP98 fusions.

Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated as there is no physiological pathway to excrete iron from the body. Excess iron is, therefore, stored in tissues like liver, heart and bone marrow and can lead to progressive organ damage. The presence of free iron in the form of non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) is especially detrimental. Reactive oxygen species can also cause stromal damage in the bone marrow and promote leukemic cell growth in vitro. In acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes outcome is worse in patients with SIO compared to patients without. Especially in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT presence of NTBI before or during transplant has been shown to negatively affect non-relapse mortality and overall survival. Although the mechanisms, of how these effects are mediated by SIO are not very well understood monitoring of iron status by serum markers and imaging techniques is, therefore, mandatory especially in these patients. Whether peri-interventional iron chelation may improve outcome of these patients is part of current clinical research.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a comprehensive assessment of the severity is difficult because a standardized assessment measure is unavailable. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel symptom score for the assessment of urinary dysfunction in HAM/TSP. We interviewed 449 patients with HAM/TSP using four internationally validated questionnaires for assessment of urinary symptoms (27 question items in total): the International Prostate Symptom Score; the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form; the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score; and the Nocturia Quality-of-Life questionnaire. We developed a symptom score based on the data of 322 patients who did not use urinary catheters by selecting question items from questionnaires focused on descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. The score distribution, reliability, and validity of the developed score were evaluated. RESULTS: First, 16 questions related to quality of life, situations, or subjective assessment were omitted from the 27 questions. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the remaining 11 questions pertained to three factors: frequent urination, urinary incontinence, and voiding symptoms. Three questions, which had similar questions with larger factor loading, were deleted. Finally, we selected eight question items for inclusion in the novel score. The score distribution exhibited no ceiling or floor effect. The Cronbach's alpha (0.737) demonstrated reliable internal consistency. The new score comprised two subscales with acceptable factorial validity (inter-factor correlation coefficient, 0.322): storage symptoms (frequent urination plus urinary incontinence) and voiding symptoms. The correlation between each item and the subscales suggested acceptable construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel score, the HAM/TSP-Bladder Dysfunction Symptom Score, and demonstrated its reliability and validity. The applicability of this score to patients using catheters should be examined in future research.",,"['Yamakawa, Natsuko', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Matsuo, Tomohiro', 'Yamauchi, Junji', 'Ueno, Takahiko',

The updated recommendations suggest that rabbit antithymocyte globulin or anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) should be used for GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing matched-unrelated donor (MUD) allo-HSCT. More recently, using post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) in the haploidentical setting has resulted in low incidences of both acute (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare GVHD prophylaxis using either PTCY or ATG in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent allo-HSCT in first remission (CR1) from a 10/10 HLA-MUD. METHODS: Overall, 174 and 1452 patients from the EBMT registry receiving PTCY and ATG were included. Cumulative incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD, leukemia-free survival, overall survival, non-relapse mortality, cumulative incidence of relapse, and refined GVHD-free, relapse-free survival were compared between the 2 groups. Propensity score matching was also performed in order to confirm the results of the main analysis RESULTS: No statistical difference between the PTCY and ATG groups was observed for the incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD. The same held true for the incidence of cGVHD and for extensive cGVHD. In univariate and multivariate analyses, no statistical differences were observed for all other transplant outcomes. These results were also confirmed using matched-pair analysis. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that, in the10/10 HLA-MUD setting, the use of PTCY for GVHD prophylaxis may provide similar outcomes to those obtained with ATG in patients with AML in CR1.",,"['Brissot, Eolia', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Moiseev, Ian', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Meijer, Ellen', 'Van Gorkom, Gwendolyn', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Mistrik, Martin', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Bulabois, Claude Eric', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Brissot E', 'Labopin M', 'Moiseev I', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Meijer E', 'Van Gorkom G', 'Rovira M', 'Ciceri F', 'Griskevicius L', 'Blaise D', 'Forcade E', 'Mistrik M', 'Mielke S', 'Bulabois CE', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Deconinck E', 'Ruggeri A', 'Sanz J', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Savani B', 'Giebel S', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Sorbonne Universite, AP-HP, INSERM UMRs938, Paris, France. eolia.brissot@aphp.fr.', ""Service d'Hematologie clinique et de Therapie cellulaire, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, 184, rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France. eolia.brissot@aphp.fr."", 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'R.M.

In this study, we describe histomorphologic and genetic changes occurring in serial bone marrow measurements in a patient with MIRAGE syndrome and untreated MDS of 9 years. Histomorphological analysis during childhood showed progressive hypocellularity with erythroid and megakaryocytic dysplasia and cytogenetic testing demonstrated monosomy 7. Serial leukemia gene panel testing performed over a seven year period revealed multiple pre-leukemic clones arising at age 7 years followed by sequential mutational events in ETV6 and RUNX1 driving acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at age 9. Comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis with 28 previously reported patients found the presence of MDS did not impact overall survival, but in silico variant pathogenicity prediction scores for SAMD9 distinguished patients with poor prognosis. Overall, our analysis shows progression of MDS to AML can be monitored by following mutation evolution in leukemia related genes in patients with MIRAGE syndrome, and specific SAMD9 mutations likely influence disease severity and overall survival.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate chest CT features in patients with malignancy and concomitant COVID-19 infection. In fact, the imaging findings can be challenging and have not yet been fully understood in this setting. In this manuscript, we go over imaging findings in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 and known cancer. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, in at-risk and vulnerable populations such as patients with known malignancies, infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be included in the differential considerations even with atypical image pictures.

Combination treatment, especially with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 inhibitor (HDAC6i), appears to be an attractive option to prevent TKI resistance, considering the potential capacity of an HDAC6i to diminish BCR-ABL expression. We first validated the in vivo anti-cancer potential of the compound 7b by significantly reducing the tumor burden of BALB/c mice xenografted with K-562 cells, without notable organ toxicity. Here, we hypothesize that the HDAC6i compound 7b can lead to BCR-ABL downregulation in CML cells and sensitize them to TKI treatment. The results showed that combination treatment with imatinib and 7b resulted in strong synergistic caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death and drastically reduced the proportion of leukemia stem cells, whereas this treatment only moderately affected healthy cells. Ultimately, the combination significantly decreased colony formation in a semisolid methylcellulose medium and tumor mass in xenografted zebrafish compared to each compound alone. Mechanistically, the combination induced BCR-ABL ubiquitination and downregulation followed by disturbance of key proteins in downstream pathways involved in CML proliferation and survival. Taken together, our results suggest that an HDAC6i potentiates the effect of imatinib and could overcome TKI resistance in CML cells.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

One example is the mutation of the DNA demethylase tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) that frequently persists from diagnosis through remission and relapse, but whose fitness advantage in chemotherapy is unclear. Here, we use isogenic human AML cell lines to show that TET2 loss of function alters the dynamics of transitions between differentiated and stem-like states. A conceptual mathematical model and experimental validation suggest that these altered cell-state dynamics can benefit the cell population by slowing population decay during drug treatment and lowering the number of survivor cells needed to re-establish the initial population. These studies shed light on the functional and phenotypic effects of a TET2 mutation in AML and illustrate how a single gene mutation can alter a cells' phenotypic plasticity.

This study aimed to explore risk factors for relapse of childhood B-ALL. MATERIAL AND METHODS Total of 102 pediatric B-ALL patients were included in this study. B-ALL patients were divided into a relapse group and a non-relapse group. Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis time, fusion gene, and minimal residual disease (MRD) were assessed. White blood cell (WBC) count in peripheral blood and risk stratification were evaluated in newly-diagnosed patients. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to evaluate the correlation between risk factors and relapse rates. Multivariate analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazard model to estimate relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and hazard ratio (HR). Finally, 99 cases of B-ALL were included in this study. RESULTS There were significant differences between the relapse group and the non-relapse group in age (p=0.004), chemotherapy-induced agranulocytopenia (p=0.001), WBC count in peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients (p=0.016), risk stratification (p=0.000), and MRD at 12th week (p=0.007). Age over 10 years, high-risk stratification, long period of agranulocytopenia, higher WBC counts, and MRD more than 10(-)(4) were correlated with higher B-ALL relapse rate (p<0.05).

BCL-2 and MCL-1 are anti-apoptotic proteins that inhibit programmed cell death and their over-expression has been shown to be associated with reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy and poor survival in cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, three SNPs in the promoter region of antiapoptotic genes were investigated in an effort to inspect the occurrences of SNPs (rs2279115, rs4987852) in the promoter region of BCL2 and SNP (rs9803935) in the promoter region of MCL1 in Jordanian patients with CRC, and investigate correlations between BCL2 and MCL1 SNPs and clinical outcomes. METHODS: PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based analysis was used for samples genotyping. RESULTS: The BCL2 rs2279115 and MCL1 rs9803935 SNPs showed significant distribution where mutant and hetero genotypes are more prominent in CRC patients. Additionally, the rs2279115 genotypes and alleles were associated with stages of disease, its recurrence and metastasis. The MCL1 rs9803935 genotypes were associated disease metastasis. However, for BCL2 rs4987852 SNP, there was no association of genotypes or alleles with any of the disease variables. CONCLUSION: The BCL2 SNPs (rs2279115) and MCL1 SNP (rs9803935) present as important determinants of the progress of CRC in Jordanian patients.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Mhaidat, Nizar M', 'Amawi, Haneen', 'Alzoubi, Karem H']","['Mhaidat NM', 'Amawi H', 'Alzoubi KH']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, Yarmouk University, Irbid 21110, Jordan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'Chemotherapy', 'Jordan.', 'MCL1', 'SNP', 'colorectal cancer']",,2020/07/04 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/07/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPB-EPUB-107889 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201021666200703200126 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2021;22(5):646-653. doi: 10.2174/1389201021666200703200126.,,5,,20210616,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Jordan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the coding region of the IRF-1 are likely to influence the IRF-1 and its DNA binding affinity. The molecular mechanism of the DNA recognition with the IRF-1 protein upon mutations is still unknown. In this study, we have elucidated the structural and functional behavior of the wild-type and mutant (K75E and E222K) IRF-1 proteins and their corresponding molecular mechanisms with DNA recognition at the molecular level, using molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we also applied the docking approach to examine the binding between the IRF-1 protein and DNA upon mutations. This study evidently explains that, due to mutations, the IRF-1 structure loses its stability and becomes more flexible than the wild-type protein. This structural loss might affect IRF-1-DNA interaction and lead to the inhibition of cancer suppression. Identifying the effects of IRF-1 at the molecular level will be beneficial for designing drugs for IRF-1 associated cancers. These drugs should be designed so that they can help reactivate the IRF-1 function, by increasing the transcriptional activity, to treat leukemia.",,"['Kamaraj, Balu', 'Al-Subaie, Abeer Mohammed', 'Ahmad, Fazil', 'Surapaneni, Krishna Mohan', 'Alsamman, Khaldoon']","['Kamaraj B', 'Al-Subaie AM', 'Ahmad F', 'Surapaneni KM', 'Alsamman K']","['Department of Neuroscience Technology, College of Applied Medical Science in Jubail, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Jubail, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Anesthesia Technology, College of Applied Medical Sciences in Jubail, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Jubail, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, College of Applied Medical Sciences-Jubail (CAMSJ), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Al Jubail, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200703,England,J Biomol Struct Dyn,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,8404176,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*DNA', '*IRF-1', '*interaction', '*leukemia', '*mutation', '*stability']",,2020/07/04 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2020/07/04 06:00'],"['2020/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07391102.2020.1784790 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomol Struct Dyn. 2021 Sep;39(14):5235-5247. doi: 10.1080/07391102.2020.1784790.

Survival was evaluated for 110 patients, including 74 who received HSCT in continuous complete remission. With a median follow-up of 59.8 months, median survival (months) was 36.5 (95% CI: 22.0-not reached [NR]).

We conducted a multicenter prospective clinical sequencing study to verify the feasibility of a panel test for hematological tumors, including acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Out of 96 eligible patients, 79 patients (82%) showed potentially actionable findings, based on the clinical sequencing assays. We identified that genetic alterations with a strong clinical significance were found at a higher frequency in terms of diagnosis (n = 60; 63%) and prognosis (n = 61; 64%) than in terms of therapy (n = 8; 8%). Three patients who harbored a germline mutation in either DDX41 (n = 2) or BRCA2 (n = 1) were provided with genetic counseling. At 6 mo after sequencing, clinical actions based on the diagnostic (n = 5) or prognostic (n = 3) findings were reported, but no patients were enrolled in a clinical trial or received targeted therapies based on the sequencing results.

Hematological patients as immunocompromised hosts are vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There is little information available regarding the clinical features of hematological patients concomitant with COVID-19. In this study, 9 concomitant patients were analyzed for their clinical manifestations, laboratory data, radiological findings, and immunologic features. The median age was 50 years (range, 17-68 years) and 6 patients were male. Seven patients were infected through hospital-associated transmission and other 2 through community-associated transmission. Onset of COVID-19 in all patients occurred during routine treatments for their hematological diseases. Eight patients were classified as moderate and 1 patient as critically ill COVID-19. Four patients died, 1 from leukemia progression, 2 from life-threatening secondary infection, and the other from respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Abruptly elevated levels of cytokines were often correlated with progressive hematological disease or concurrent bacterial infections. Two patients had atypical computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of COVID-19. The median interval from the first CT scan imaging to improvement in survivors was 40 days (range, 14-51 days). Four of 5 survivors had negative serological tests 1 month after symptom onset. Positive viral load in 4 survivors lasted longer than 45 days.

The current concept is that the cardiac effects of NRG1 are mediated by activation of erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB)4/ERBB2 receptors on cardiomyocytes. However, recent studies have shown that paracrine effects of NRG1 on fibroblasts and macrophages are equally important. Here, we hypothesize that NRG1 autocrine signaling plays a role in cardiac remodeling. We generated EC-specific Erbb4 knockout mice to eliminate endothelial autocrine ERBB4 signaling without affecting paracrine NRG1/ERBB4 signaling in the heart. We first observed no basal cardiac phenotype in these mice up to 32 wk. We next studied these mice following transverse aortic constriction (TAC), exposure to angiotensin II (ANG II), or myocardial infarction in terms of cardiac performance, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and capillary density. In general, no major differences between EC-specific Erbb4 knockout mice and control littermates were observed. However, 8 wk following TAC both myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis were attenuated by EC-specific Erbb4 deletion, albeit these responses were normalized after 20 wk. Similarly, 4 wk after ANG II treatment, myocardial fibrosis was less pronounced compared with control littermates. These observations were supported by RNA-sequencing experiments on cultured endothelial cells showing that NRG1 controls the expression of various hypertrophic and fibrotic pathways. Overall, this study shows a role of endothelial autocrine NRG1/ERBB4 signaling in the modulation of hypertrophic and fibrotic responses during early cardiac remodeling. This study contributes to understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of myocardial autocrine and paracrine responses following cardiac injury.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The role of NRG1/ERBB signaling in endothelial cells is not completely understood.

The leaf extracts of T sinensis possess and exhibit anticancer efficacy against various cancer cell types. In Taiwanese folklore, Antrodia camphorata, also known as ""Niu-Cheng-Zi,"" is used in traditional medicine to treat various illnesses. Its fruit and mycelium possess various potent antiproliferative properties. Two studies from our group have reported that T sinensis or A camphorata has the ability to cause apoptosis in various cancer cells. Conversely, underlying molecular mechanisms and any beneficial effects remain unknown. This study shows anticancer efficacy for both T sinensis and A camphorata co-treatments that target HL-60 cells. The combination index values indicate that 40 microg/mL of T sinensis and 25 microg/mL of A camphorata as a combined treatment shows a synergetic effect, which reduces HL-60 cell proliferation. Alternately, this treatment exhibited no cytotoxic effects for human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Western blot data showed that T sinensis and A camphorata as a combined treatment result in augmented expression of apoptosis, cytochrome c release, Bcl-2 inhibition, expression of Bax, Fas, and FasL, as well as the cleavage of Bid in HL-60 cells. Moreover, this combined treatment overshadowed monotherapy in its ability to inhibit uPAR, MMP-9, MMP-2, COX-2 expression, and PGE2 secretions.

PROCEDURE: Children aged 1-18 years who developed vincristine-induced neuropathy on a St Jude frontline acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial were prospectively enrolled on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial with two treatment arms: gabapentin plus opioid versus placebo plus opioid. Daily evaluations of morphine dose (mg/kg per day) and pain scores were conducted for up to 21 days; the values of the two arms were compared to assess analgesic efficacy. RESULTS: Of 51 study participants, 49 were eligible for analyses. Twenty-five participants were treated with gabapentin, with a mean (SD) dose of 17.97 (2.76) mg/kg per day (median 18.26, range 6.82-21.37). The mean (SD) opioid doses taken, expressed as morphine equivalent daily (mg/kg per day), were 0.26 (0.43) in the gabapentin group (25 patients, 432 days) and 0.15 (0.22) in the placebo group (24 patients, 411 days; P = .15). Only the risk classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was significantly associated with the daily morphine dosage (P = .0178): patients in the lower risk arm received higher daily morphine dosages. Multivariate analyses revealed a significant difference between the groups' average daily scores for the previous 24 h and ""right now."" CONCLUSION: In this population of children with vincristine-related neuropathic pain, opioid consumption and pain scores were higher in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group.

In the HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model that represents a rare RA-responsive subtype of AML, IRF-1 is not expressed until RA induces its prominent expression, and ectopic IRF-1 expression enhances RA-induced differentiation, motivating interest in how IRF-1 is putatively needed for RA response. Accordingly, we created CRISPR/Cas9-mediated IRF-1 knockout HL-60 cells. Contrary to expectation, loss of IRF-1 did not diminish RA-induced cellular signaling that propels differentiation, and RA-induced cell differentiation markers, including CD38 and CD11b expression and G1/G0cell cycle arrest, were unaffected. However, elimination of IRF-1 inhibited RA-induced p47phox expression and inducible oxidative metabolism detected by reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting IRF-1 is essential for mature granulocytic inducible oxidative metabolism. In the case of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation to monocytes, IRF-1 loss did not affect D3-induced expression of CD38, CD11b, and CD14, and G1/0 arrest; but inhibited ROS production. Our data suggest that IRF-1 is inessential for differentiation but upregulates p47phox expression for mature-cell ROS production.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Zhu, Kaiyuan', 'Yue, Jianbo', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Zhu K', 'Yue J', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences Cornell University Ithaca NY USA.', 'City University of Hong Kong ShenZhen Research Institute ShenZhen China.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences City University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China.', 'City University of Hong Kong ShenZhen Research Institute ShenZhen China.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences City University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences Cornell University Ithaca NY USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200522,United States,FASEB Bioadv,FASEB bioAdvances,101733210,PMC7325585,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60 cells', 'differentiation', 'inducible oxidative metabolism', 'interferon regulatory factor-1(IRF-1)', 'retinoic acid']",['None.'],2020/07/04 06:00,2020/07/04 06:01,['2020/07/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1096/fba.2020-00004 [doi]', 'FBA21127 [pii]']",epublish,FASEB Bioadv. 2020 May 22;2(6):354-364. doi: 10.1096/fba.2020-00004. eCollection 2020 Jun.,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In immunocompetent hosts, P. variotii has been reported as a cause of locally invasive disease including prosthetic valve endocarditis [7, 8], endophthalmitis [9, 10], rhinosinusitis [11, 12], and dialysis-associated peritonitis [13, 14]. In contrast, disseminated infections are more commonly reported in immunocompromised patients, including those with chronic granulomatous disease [15], solid malignancy [16], acute leukemia [17], lymphoma [18], multiple myeloma [19], and after stem cell transplant for myelodysplasia [20]. In 1 case series examining invasive infections by non-Aspergillus molds, P. variotii was the most common cause after Fusarium spp. [21]. Here, we present the case of an immunocompetent patient with extensive intravascular infection involving prosthetic material. We describe successful induction therapy with combination antifungals and extended suppression with posaconazole with clinical quiescence and eventual normalization of serum fungal biomarkers.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Abnormal GPX expression is associated with carcinogenesis. However, the potential role of the GPX gene family in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains to be comprehensively examined. Methods: We analyzed GPX mRNA expression levels and determined the correlation between gene expression and the prognostic value via multiple universally acknowledged databases including the Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), PROGgeneV2, UALCAN, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) databases. The functional network of differentially expressed GPXs was investigated via the NetworkAnalyst platform. Correlated genes as well as kinase, microRNA (miRNA), and transcription factor (TF) targets were identified using LinkedOmics. Results: We observed that the transcriptional expression levels of GPX-1, -2, -4, -7, and -8 had significant difference between AML patients samples and normal samples, and that AML patients with high expression of GPX-1, -3, -4, and -7 were associated with poorer prognosis of overall survival (OS). Functional enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed GPXs were mainly enriched in response to oxidative stress, regulation of immune response, and inflammatory response, along with glutathione metabolism and ferroptosis. Overexpression of correlated genes, PSMB10, VPS13D, NDUFS8, ATP5D, POLR2E, and HADH were linked to adverse OS in AML. Regulatory network analysis indicated that differentially expressed GPXs regulated cell proliferation, cancer progression, apoptosis, and cell cycle signaling via pathways involving cancer-related kinases (such as DAPK1 and SRC), miRNAs (such as miR-202 and miR-181), and TFs (such as SRF and E2F1). Conclusions: Our findings offer novel insights into the differential expression and prognostic potential of the GPX family in AML, and lay a foundation for subsequent research of GPX's role in the carcinogenesis and regulatory network of AML.",['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

As a result, gene markers for predicting AML prognosis must be identified through systemic analysis of multi-omics data. Methods: First of all, the copy number variation (CNV), mutation, RNA-Seq, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, as well as those clinical follow-up data, were obtained based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Thereafter, all samples (n = 229) were randomized as test set and training set, respectively. Of them, the training set was used to screen for genes related to prognosis, and genes with mutation, SNP or CNV. Then, shrinkage estimate was used for feature selection of all the as-screened genes, to select those stable biomarkers. Eventually, a prognosis model related to those genes was established, and validated within the GEO verification (n = 124 and 72) and test set (n = 127). Moreover, it was compared with the AML prognosis prediction model reported in literature. Results: Altogether 832 genes related to prognosis, 23 related to copy amplification, 774 associated with copy deletion, and 189 with significant genomic variations were acquired in this study. Later, genes with genomic variations and those related to prognosis were integrated to obtain 38 candidate genes; eventually, a shrinkage estimate was adopted to obtain 10 feature genes (including FAT2, CAMK2A, TCERG1, GDF9, PTGIS, DOC2B, DNTTIP1, PREX1, CRISPLD1 and C22orf42). Further, a signature was established using these 10 genes based on Cox regression analysis, and it served as an independent factor to predict AML prognosis. More importantly, it was able to stratify those external verification, test and training set samples with regard to the risk (P < 0.01). Compared with the prognosis prediction model reported in literature, the model established in this study was advantageous in terms of the prediction performance. Conclusion: The signature based on 10 genes had been established in this study, which is promising to be used to be a new marker for predicting AML prognosis.",['(c)2020 Zhuang et al.'],"['Zhuang, Haifeng', 'Chen, Yu', 'Sheng, Xianfu', 'Hong, Lili', 'Gao, Ruilan', 'Zhuang, Xiaofen']","['Zhuang H', 'Chen Y', 'Sheng X', 'Hong L', 'Gao R', 'Zhuang X']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang Zhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Medical College, Hang Zhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang Zhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang Zhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hang Zhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Fuyang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hang Zhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200625,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,PMC7321666,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelocytic leukemia', 'Bioinformatics', 'CNV', 'Prognosis marker', 'TCGA']",['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],2020/07/04 06:00,2020/07/04 06:01,['2020/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.9437 [doi]', '9437 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2020 Jun 25;8:e9437. doi: 10.7717/peerj.9437. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PHRF1 also participates in modulating non-homologous end-joining. However, the role of PHRF1 in mammalian dendrite architecture and synaptic plasticity is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PHRF1 in dendritic formation in the murine hippocampus using Camk2a promoter driven-iCre recombinase to conduct a PHRF1 conditional knockout, namely PHRF1(Delta/Delta), in the forebrain region. PHRF1(Delta/Delta) mice developed normally, but exhibited anxiety-like behaviors and displayed defective spatial memory. Alterations of dendritic complexity in apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons were noticed in PHRF1(Delta/Delta) mutants.

Therefore, not all patients with CLL require treatment at the time of diagnosis. Hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell count, >100x10(9)/L) is present in a large proportion of patients with CLL. However, symptomatic hyperleukocytosis (leukostasis) is an extremely uncommon presentation of CLL. Leukostasis frequently presents with the clinical manifestation of respiratory, neurological, or renal system problems. This is secondary to the decreased tissue perfusion due to the intravascular accumulation of large aggregates of leukemic cells. Leukostasis is a medical emergency requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and its management includes aggressive hydration, prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome, cytoreduction, and leukapheresis. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 77-year-old woman with a long history of untreated CLL who presented with respiratory symptoms with hyperleukocytosis. Her condition rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation. She required induction chemotherapy with chlorambucil as well as 2 sessions of leukapheresis, to which she responded well. In most reported leukostasis cases in the literature, the white blood cell (WBC) count was >1000x10(9)/L. We present a case of a patient with leukostasis with WBC count 524x10(9)/L who responded to chlorambucil and leukapheresis, with good recovery. CONCLUSIONS Leukostasis, although extremely rare, is a life-threatening complication in patients with CLL. It should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with CLL who present with hyperleukocytosis and acute pulmonary symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of this medical emergency, as delayed treatment can increase morbidity and mortality.",,"['Singh, Navdeep', 'Singh Lubana, Sandeep', 'Dabrowski, Lech', 'Sidhu, Gurinder']","['Singh N', 'Singh Lubana S', 'Dabrowski L', 'Sidhu G']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hospice and Palliative Care, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, State University New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, State University New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, State University New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200703,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,PMC7360358,,,,2020/07/04 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/07/04 06:00'],"['2020/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['924798 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.924798 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Jul 3;21:e924798. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.924798.,,,,20210222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Cough/etiology', 'Dyspnea/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukostasis/*etiology/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD44 and the integrin VLA-4, a CD49d/CD29 heterodimer, are important factors of progenitor cell adhesion in bone marrow (BM). Here, we report their cooperation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by a novel non-classical CD44-mediated way of inside-out VLA-4 activation. In primary AML BM samples from patients and the OCI-AML3 cell line, CD44 engagement by hyaluronan induced inside-out activation of VLA-4 resulting in enhanced leukemia cell adhesion on VCAM-1. This was independent from VLA-4 affinity regulation but based on ligand-induced integrin clustering on the cell surface. CD44-induced VLA-4 activation could be inhibited by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 and the multikinase inhibitor midostaurin. In further consequence, the increased adhesion on VCAM-1 allowed AML cells to strongly bind stromal cells. Thereby VLA-4/VCAM-1 interaction promoted activation of Akt, MAPK, NF-kB and mTOR signaling and decreased AML cell apoptosis. Collectively, our investigations provide a mechanistic description of an unusual CD44 function in regulating VLA-4 avidity in AML, supporting AML cell retention in the supportive BM microenvironment.",,"['Gutjahr, Julia C', 'Bayer, Elisabeth', 'Yu, Xiaobing', 'Laufer, Julia M', 'Hopner, Jan P', 'Tesanovic, Suzana', 'Harzschel, Andrea', 'Auer, Georg', 'Riess, Tanja', 'Salmhofer, Astrid', 'Szenes, Eva', 'Haslauer, Theresa', 'Durand-Onayli, Valerie', 'Ramspacher, Andrea', 'Pennisi, Sandra P', 'Artinger, Marc', 'Zaborsky, Nadja', 'Chigaev, Alexandre', 'Aberger, Fritz', 'Neureiter, Daniel', 'Pleyer, Lisa', 'Legler, Daniel F', 'Orian-Rousseau, Veronique', 'Greil, Richard', 'Hartmann, Tanja N']","['Gutjahr JC', 'Bayer E', 'Yu X', 'Laufer JM', 'Hopner JP', 'Tesanovic S', 'Harzschel A', 'Auer G', 'Riess T', 'Salmhofer A', 'Szenes E', 'Haslauer T', 'Durand-Onayli V', 'Ramspacher A', 'Pennisi SP', 'Artinger M', 'Zaborsky N', 'Chigaev A', 'Aberger F', 'Neureiter D', 'Pleyer L', 'Legler DF', 'Orian-Rousseau V', 'Greil R', 'Hartmann TN']","['3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Toxicology and Genetics.', 'Biotechnology Institute Thurgau (BITg) at the University of Konstanz.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', 'Department Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', 'Department Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg.', 'Biotechnology Institute Thurgau (BITg) at the University of Konstanz, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland.', '1Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research.', 'Department of Pathology and Cancer Center, University of New Mexico.', 'Department Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg.', 'Institute of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', 'Biotechnology Institute Thurgau (BITg) at the University of Konstanz.', 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Toxicology and Genetics.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.', '3rd Medical Department, SCRI-LIMCR, Paracelsus Medical University, Cancer Cluster Salzburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210801,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC8327716,,,,2020/07/04 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.231944 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.231944 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 1;106(8):2102-2113. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.231944.,['P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],8,,20210928,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics', '*Integrin alpha4beta1', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prevalence of TKI-induced fatigue remains uncertain and little is known about predictors of fatigue and its relationship with physical activity. In this study, 220 CML patients receiving TKI therapy and 110 gender- and age-matched controls completed an online questionnaire to assess fatigue severity and fatigue predictors (Part 1). In addition, physical activity levels were objectively assessed for 7 consecutive days in 138 severely fatigued and non-fatigued CML patients using an activity monitor (Part 2). We demonstrated that the prevalence of severe fatigue was 55.5% in CML patients and 10.9% in controls (P<0.001). We identified five predictors of fatigue in our CML population: age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99), female gender (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.92-3.34), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.16-3.13), the use of comedication known to cause fatigue (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.58-7.44), and physical inactivity (OR of moderately active, vigorously active and very vigorously active compared to inactivity 0.43 (95% CI 0.12-1.52), 0.22 (95% CI 0.06-0.74), and 0.08 (95% CI 0.02-0.26), respectively). Objective monitoring of activity patterns confirmed that fatigued CML patients performed less physical activity on both light (P=0.017) and moderate to vigorous intensity (P=0.009). In fact, compared to the non-fatigued patients, fatigued CML patients performed 1 hour less of physical activity per day and took 2000 fewer steps per day. Our findings facilitate the identification of patients at risk of severe fatigue and highlight the importance to set the reduction of fatigue as a treatment goal in CML care.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we sought to comprehensively assess T-cell repertoire changes during treatment in relation to (i) treatment type [fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) versus ibrutinib (IB) versus rituximab-idelalisib (R-ID)], and (ii) clinical response, by combining NGS immunoprofiling, flow cytometry, and functional bioassays. RESULTS: T-cell clonality significantly increased at (i) 3 months in the FCR and R-ID treatment groups, and (ii) over deepening clinical response in the R-ID group, with a similar trend detected in the IB group. Notably, in constrast to FCR that induced T-cell repertoire reconstitution, B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors (BcRi) preserved pretreatment clones. Extensive comparisons both within CLL as well as against T-cell receptor sequence databases showed little similarity with other entities, but instead revealed major clonotypes shared exclusively by patients with CLL, alluding to selection by conserved CLL-associated antigens. We then evaluated the functional effect of treatments on T cells and found that (i) R-ID upregulated the expression of activation markers in effector memory T cells, and (ii) both BcRi improved antitumor T-cell immune synapse formation, in marked contrast to FCR. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our NGS immunoprofiling data suggest that BcRi retain T-cell clones that may have developed against CLL-associated antigens. Phenotypic and immune synapse bioassays support a concurrent restoration of functionality, mostly evident for R-ID, arguably contributing to clinical response.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Vardi, Anna', 'Vlachonikola, Elisavet', 'Papazoglou, Despoina', 'Psomopoulos, Fotis', 'Kotta, Kostantia', 'Ioannou, Nikolaos', 'Galigalidou, Chrysi', 'Gemenetzi, Katerina', 'Pasentsis, Kostantinos', 'Kotouza, Maria', 'Koravou, Evdoxia', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Iskas, Michail', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Kouvatsi, Anastasia', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia']","['Vardi A', 'Vlachonikola E', 'Papazoglou D', 'Psomopoulos F', 'Kotta K', 'Ioannou N', 'Galigalidou C', 'Gemenetzi K', 'Pasentsis K', 'Kotouza M', 'Koravou E', 'Scarfo L', 'Iskas M', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Ghia P', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Kouvatsi A', 'Ramsay AG', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Chatzidimitriou A']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

The results of entropy analysis of the sequences of gag, pol, and env revealed that the env gene had the largest variation, and the gag gene nonconserved sites are mainly concentrated in p19, p10, and p12. In addition, 84.71% (72/85) of the isolates had the 205-nucleotide (nt) deletion in the 3'UTR region, and 30.59% (26/85) of the isolates had the 125-nt to 127-nt deletion in the E element. Our study provides evidence for the coexistence of 2 extremely different clusters of ALV-J prevailing in China and in some other countries during the period of 1988-2018 and implies that the clusters are highly dependent on the host genetic background and the geographic location.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3(+) T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients.

Alterations in groups of TF-binding profiles (i.e. ""co-binding changes"") can affect the co-regulating associations between TFs (i.e. ""rewiring the co-regulator network""). This, in turn, can potentially drive downstream expression changes, phenotypic variation, and even disease. However, quantification of co-regulatory network rewiring has not been comprehensively studied. RESULTS: To address this, we propose DiNeR, a computational method to directly construct a differential TF co-regulation network from paired disease-to-normal ChIP-seq data. Specifically, DiNeR uses a graphical model to capture the gained and lost edges in the co-regulation network. Then, it adopts a stability-based, sparsity-tuning criterion -- by sub-sampling the complete binding profiles to remove spurious edges -- to report only significant co-regulation alterations. Finally, DiNeR highlights hubs in the resultant differential network as key TFs associated with disease. We assembled genome-wide binding profiles of 104 TFs in the K562 and GM12878 cell lines, which loosely model the transition between normal and cancerous states in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In total, we identified 351 significantly altered TF co-regulation pairs. In particular, we found that the co-binding of the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and RNA polymerase II, a well-known transcriptional pair in healthy cells, was disrupted in tumors. Thus, DiNeR successfully extracted hub regulators and discovered well-known risk genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our method DiNeR makes it possible to quantify changes in co-regulatory networks and identify alterations to TF co-binding patterns, highlighting key disease regulators.

While efficacious, current approaches using non-selective HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown to cause a range of undesirable clinical toxicities. To circumvent this, recent efforts have focused on the design of highly selective HDACi as a novel therapeutic strategy. Beyond roles in regulating transcription, the unique HDAC6 (with two catalytic domains) regulates the deacetylation of alpha-tubulin; promoting growth factor-controlled cell motility, cell division, and metastatic hallmarks. Recent studies have linked aberrant HDAC6 function in various hematological cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia and multiple myeloma. Herein, we report the discovery, in vitro characterization, and biological evaluation of PTG-0861 (JG-265), a novel HDAC6-selective inhibitor with strong isozyme-selectivity ( approximately 36x ) and low nanomolar potency (IC50 = 5.92 nM) against HDAC6. This selectivity profile was rationalized via in silico docking studies and also observed in cellulo through cellular target engagement. Moreover, PTG-0861 achieved relevant potency against several blood cancer cell lines (e.g. MV4-11, MM1S), whilst showing limited cytotoxicity against non-malignant cells (e.g. NHF, HUVEC) and CD-1 mice. In examining compound stability and cellular permeability, PTG-0861 revealed a promising in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Altogether, in this study we identified a novel and potent HDAC6-selective inhibitor ( approximately 4x more selective than current clinical standards - citarinostat, ricolinostat), which achieves cellular target engagement, efficacy in hematological cancer cells with a promising safety profile and in vitro PK.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Prognostication is important to place patients into different risk categories for guiding decisions on clinical management, to treat or not to treat. Although several clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular parameters have been established, in the past decade, a tremendous understanding of molecular lesions has been obtained with the advent of high-throughput sequencing. Meanwhile, rapid advances in the understanding of the CLL oncogenic pathways have led to the development of small-molecule targeting signal transducers, Bruton tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, as well as anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 apoptosis regulator. After an initial response to these targeted therapies, some patients develop resistance and experience disease progression. Novel gene mutations have been identified that account for some of the drug resistance mechanisms. This article focuses on the prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers in CLL relevant to the molecular pathology practice, beginning with a review of well-established prognostic markers that have already been incorporated into major clinical guidelines, which will be followed by a discussion of emerging biomarkers that are expected to impact clinical practice soon in the future. Special emphasis will be put on predictive biomarkers related to newer targeted therapies in hopes that this review will serve as a useful reference for molecular diagnostic professionals, clinicians, as well as laboratory investigators and trainees.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

Different animal models of myeloid malignancies reveal how neoplastic cells alter the structural and functional characteristics of the hematopoietic stem cell niche to reinforce malignancy. Understanding and disruption of the microenvironmental interactions with AML cells are a vital need. Malignant niches frequently go along with inflammatory responses, but their impact on cancerogenesis often remains unexplored. Here, we uncovered an aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines in untreated AML bone marrow that was proved to promote the proliferation of leukemia cells. This inflammatory response induced an activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in AML blasts as well as bone marrow stromal cells that also fostered leukemia proliferation. Inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling using the selective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib resulted in significant antileukemic activity in AML in vitro which is mediated through both cell-autonomous and microenvironment-mediated mechanisms. However, in a xenograft transplantation model, monotherapy with ruxolitinib did not achieve substantial antileukemic activity, possibly suggesting a complementary function of JAK1/2 inhibition in AML.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Habbel, Jan', 'Arnold, Lucas', 'Chen, Yiyang', 'Mollmann, Michael', 'Bruderek, Kirsten', 'Brandau, Sven', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Hanoun, Maher']","['Habbel J', 'Arnold L', 'Chen Y', 'Mollmann M', 'Bruderek K', 'Brandau S', 'Duhrsen U', 'Hanoun M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan; and.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Research Division, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Research Division, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC7362361,,,,2020/07/03 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31629-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001292 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jul 14;4(13):3000-3010. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001292.,,13,,20210519,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Inflammation/drug therapy', '*Janus Kinases', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transducers', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reported cumulative incidence curves of molecular recurrence (MRec) arbor a 2-phase shape with mainly early events, but also some late events (late MRec [LMRec]). Having discontinued our first patient in 2004, we have access to a prolonged follow-up, enabling us to characterize these late events. Over 15 years, 128 patients from our institution were registered in the Stop Imatinib (STIM; A Study for Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Discontinuation [A-STIM]) trial. MRec was defined by the loss of major molecular response (BCR-ABL1IS >0.1%). At the first TFR attempt, patients had been taking a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for a median of 7.1 years and in BCR-ABL1IS </=0.01% (MR4) for a median of 4 years. The median follow-up of patients in TFR was 6.5 years. The TFR rate was estimated to be 45.6% after 7 years. For 9/65 (14%) patients experiencing MRec, recurrence occurred after 2 years in TFR (median, 3.6 years). The residual rate of MRec after 2 years was estimated to be 18%. The probability of remaining in TFR was 65.4% for patients having experienced fluctuations of their minimal residual disease (MRD) (at least 2 consecutive measurements BCR-ABL1IS >0.0032% or loss of MR4), whereas it was 100% for those with stable MRD (P = .003). After 2 years in TFR, we observed an 18% residual rate of LMRec. These late events represent 14% of all MRec and occur in patients with fluctuating MRD measurements. A long-term molecular follow-up therefore remains mandatory for CML patients in TFR.

Cytokine-induced memory-like (ML) NK cells differentiate after activation with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18, exhibit potent antitumor responses, and safely induce complete remissions in patients with leukemia. However, many cancers are not fully recognized via NK cell receptors. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been used to enhance tumor-specific recognition by effector lymphocytes. We hypothesized that ML differentiation and CAR engineering would result in complementary improvements in NK cell responses against NK-resistant cancers. To test this idea, peripheral blood ML NK cells were modified to express an anti-CD19 CAR (19-CAR-ML), which displayed significantly increased interferon gamma production, degranulation, and specific killing against NK-resistant lymphoma lines and primary targets compared with nonspecific control CAR-ML NK cells or conventional CAR NK cells. The 19-CAR and ML responses were synergistic and CAR specific and required immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signaling. Furthermore, 19-CAR-ML NK cells generated from lymphoma patients exhibited improved responses against their autologous lymphomas. 19-CAR-ML NK cells controlled lymphoma burden in vivo and improved survival in human xenograft models. Thus, CAR engineering of ML NK cells enhanced responses against resistant cancers and warrants further investigation, with the potential to broaden ML NK cell recognition against a variety of NK cell-resistant tumors.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gang, Margery', 'Marin, Nancy D', 'Wong, Pamela', 'Neal, Carly C', 'Marsala, Lynne', 'Foster, Mark', 'Schappe, Timothy', 'Meng, Wei', 'Tran, Jennifer', 'Schaettler, Maximilian', 'Davila, Marco', 'Gao, Feng', 'Cashen, Amanda F', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Mehta-Shah, Neha', 'Kahl, Brad S', 'Kim, Miriam Y', 'Cooper, Matthew L', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Berrien-Elliott, Melissa M', 'Fehniger, Todd A']","['Gang M', 'Marin ND', 'Wong P', 'Neal CC', 'Marsala L', 'Foster M', 'Schappe T', 'Meng W', 'Tran J', 'Schaettler M', 'Davila M', 'Gao F', 'Cashen AF', 'Bartlett NL', 'Mehta-Shah N', 'Kahl BS', 'Kim MY', 'Cooper ML', 'DiPersio JF', 'Berrien-Elliott MM', 'Fehniger TA']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'H.

METHODS: In this paper, for favorable, poor, and cytogenetically normal groups of AML patients, we performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses including identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) among them, functional enrichment and regulatory networks. RESULTS: We found that DEGs were enriched in membrane-related processes. Eleven genes and two miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed among these three AML groups. In survival analysis, membrane-related genes and several miRNAs were significant on prognostic outcome. Notably, six HOXA and three HOXB genes were significantly in low expression and high methylation in AML with favorable cytogenetics. Meanwhile, the miRNA-HOX gene co-regulatory networks revealed that HOXA5 was a hub node and regulated an AML oncogene SPARC. CONCLUSION: Our work may provide novel insights to the molecular characteristics and classification between AML with different cytogenetics.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Estimated treatment-free remission (TFR) rates at 12 and 36 months were 63.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 48.7-74.3] and 59.3% (95% CI: 45.0-71.0), respectively. CD3(-) CD56(+) NK, CD16(+) CD56(+) NK, and CD57(+) CD56(+) NK large granular lymphocyte (NK-LGL), CD8(+) CD4(-) cytotoxic T cell, and CD57(+) CD3(+) T-LGL cell numbers were relatively elevated throughout the 24-month consolidation only in failed patients who molecularly relapsed within 12 months. In successful patients, these subsets elevated transiently after 12 months, but returned to basal levels after 24-month consolidation. Therefore, smaller changes in NK/T, particularly the NK subset throughout consolidation, reflected higher TFR rates. TFR rates of those patients exhibiting elevation in CD3(-) CD56(+) NK >376 cells/muL, CD16(+) CD56(+) NK > 241 cells/muL, or CD57(+) CD56(+) NK-LGL >242 cells/muL during consolidation compared with others were 26.7% (8.3%-49.6%) vs 78.3% (55.4%-90.3%), HR 0.032 (0.0027-0.38; P = .0064), 31.2% (11.4%-53.6%) vs 85.0% (60.4%-94.9%), HR 0.039 (0.0031-0.48; P = .011), or 36.8% (16.5%-57.5%) vs 77.3% (53.7%-89.8%), HR 0.21 (0.065-0.69; P = .010), respectively. Therefore, silent responses of T/NK subsets to dasatinib throughout consolidation were significant for longer TFR. Elevated NK/T, particularly NK lymphocytes responsive to dasatinib, may be immunologically insufficient to maintain TFR. Their decline, subsequently replaced by altered lymphocyte population with less response to dasatinib during sustained DMR, might be immunologically significant.

The first-generation inhibitor ibrutinib works by covalent irreversible binding to BTK, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the TEC (transient erythroblastopenia of childhood) family that plays a critical role in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. It also induces an 'off-target' inhibition of a range of other kinases including (but not limited to) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), SRC, and other kinases of the TEC family (interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase [ITK], Tec, BMX). Dermatological toxicities are among the most common toxicities of ibrutinib, but remain of mild to moderate intensity in most cases and are readily manageable. Their incidence is highest during the first year of treatment and declines over time. In addition, it has been postulated that ibrutinib-related dermatologic adverse events are mediated by the direct binding to both BTK and other 'off-target' kinases. Bruising, ecchymoses, and petechiae represent the most characteristic dermatologic adverse events. Nail and hair changes are also common, as skin infections (opportunistic infections including herpes simplex and herpes zoster virus reactivations, and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection), folliculitis, and other types of rashes. Panniculitis, aphthous-like ulcerations with stomatitis, neutrophilic dermatosis, peripheral edema, and skin cracking can also occur. Next-generation BTK inhibitors, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, have been designed to optimize BTK inhibition and minimize off-target inhibition of alternative kinases (Tec, ITK, EGFR, SRC-family kinases). These drugs have been recently FDA-approved for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Although the overall incidence of their toxicities is expected to be more limited, acalubrutinib and zanubrutinib are associated with a range of dermatologic toxic effects that appear to be similar to those previously described with ibrutinib, including bruising and ecchymoses, panniculitis, human herpesvirus infections, cellulitis, and skin rash. In particular, both drugs induce skin bleeding events in more than 30% of patients treated. However, the available dermatological data are still rather limited and will have to be consolidated prospectively. This review article analyses the wide spectrum of dermatological toxicities that can be encountered with first- and second-generation BTK inhibitors. Finally, recommendations for appropriate treatment as well as a synthesis algorithm for management are also proposed.",,"['Sibaud, Vincent', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Protin, Caroline', 'Vigarios, Emmanuelle', 'Recher, Christian', 'Ysebaert, Loic']","['Sibaud V', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Protin C', 'Vigarios E', 'Recher C', 'Ysebaert L']","['Oncodermatology Department, Institut Claudius Regaud and Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, 1 avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France. sibaud.vincent@iuct-oncopole.fr.', 'Dermatology Department, Hopital Saint-Andre, INSERM U1053, Oncogenesis of Cutaneous Lymphoma, Bordeaux, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, 1 avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France.', 'Oral Medicine Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, 1 avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, 1 avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, 1 avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex 9, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Am J Clin Dermatol,American journal of clinical dermatology,100895290,,,,,2020/07/03 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/07/03 06:00'],"['2020/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40257-020-00535-x [doi]', '10.1007/s40257-020-00535-x [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Dermatol. 2020 Dec;21(6):799-812. doi: 10.1007/s40257-020-00535-x.,,6,,20210614,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Emollients)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'AG9MHG098Z (zanubrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Administration, Cutaneous', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Benzamides/adverse effects', 'Biopsy', 'Drug Eruptions/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology/therapy', 'Ecchymosis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology/therapy', 'Emollients/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Necrosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology/therapy', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Piperidines/adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrazines/adverse effects', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Skin/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Care/methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current methods for monitoring MRD are flow cytometry, to assess aberrant immune phenotypes, and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), to target genetic aberrations such as single-nucleotide variants and gene fusions. We present the performance of an RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) method for MRD gene fusion detection compared with ddPCR. This method may have advantages, including the capacity to analyze different genetic aberrations and patients in 1 experiment. In particular, detection at the RNA level may be highly sensitive if the genetic aberration is highly expressed. METHODS: We designed a probe-based NGS panel targeting the breakpoints of 11 fusion genes previously identified in clinical patients and 2 fusion genes present in cell lines. Blocking probes were added to prevent nonspecific enrichment. Each patient RNA sample was diluted in background RNA, depleted for rRNA and globin mRNA, converted to cDNA, and prepared for sequencing. Unique sequence reads, identified by unique molecular identifiers, were aligned directly to reference transcripts. The same patient and cell-line samples were also analyzed with ddPCR for direct comparison. RESULTS: Our NGS method reached a maximum sensitivity of 1 aberrant cell in 10 000 cells and was mostly within a factor of 10 compared with ddPCR.

The pharmacodynamics of Mtx depends on the polymorphism of genes encoding proteins engaged in the folate metabolism pathway. The aim of the current study is to determine the relationship between variants of folate metabolism-related genes and the frequency of acute toxicities of HD-Mtx. Material and Methods: A group of 133 patients aged 1.5-18.1 years (median: 6.3) was treated in accordance with the ALL-IC-2002 and ALL-IC-2009 protocols. The following polymorphisms were determined: 80 G>A SLC19A1 (solute carrier family 19 member 1; rs1051266) with direct DNA sequencing, as well as 677 C>T MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; rs1801133) and the tandem repeats of the TS (thymidylate synthase) with PCR technique. HD-Mtx organ toxicities were evaluated based on the laboratory tests results and the National Cancer Institute criteria. Results: In patients with genotypes AA for SLC19A1 and CC or CT for MTHFR Mtx steady state concentrations (Css) and AUCinf were distinctly higher. In patients with genotype 3R/3R for TS initial elimination rate constant was significantly higher (P = 0.003). Patients receiving Mtx at the dose of 5 g/m(2) had lower clearance (4.35 vs. 8.92 L/h/m(2)) as compared to the ones receiving 2 g/m(2) that indicates non-linear Mtx elimination at the higher dose. Liver impairment was the most frequently observed toxicity. The homozygous genotype was associated with a significantly higher incidence of hepatic toxicity for both the SLC19A1 (P = 0.037) and TS (P = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis indicated an increased risk of vomiting for the 2R/3R genotype of the TS gene (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.33-7.68, P = 0.009) and for vomiting and hepatic toxicity for the 3R/3R genotype (vomiting: OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.12-10.23, P = 0.031; liver toxicity: OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.05-4.95, P = 0.038). None of the acute toxicities differed between the analyzed dosing groups. Conclusions: Determination of polymorphisms of SLC19A1, MTHFR, and TS genes might allow for a better prior selection of patients with higher risk of elevated Mtx levels. Our study is the first one to report the increased risk of hepatotoxicity and vomiting in patients with TS polymorphisms.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Cwiklinska, Czogala, Kwiecinska, Madetko-Talowska, Szafarz,', 'Pawinska, Wieczorek, Klekawka, Rej, Stepien, Halubiec, Lazarczyk, Miklusiak,', 'Bik-Multanowski, Balwierz and Skoczen.']","['Cwiklinska, Magdalena', 'Czogala, Malgorzata', 'Kwiecinska, Kinga', 'Madetko-Talowska, Anna', 'Szafarz, Malgorzata', 'Pawinska, Katarzyna', 'Wieczorek, Aleksandra', 'Klekawka, Tomasz', 'Rej, Magdalena', 'Stepien, Konrad', 'Halubiec, Przemyslaw', 'Lazarczyk, Agnieszka', 'Miklusiak, Karol', 'Bik-Multanowski, Miroslaw', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Skoczen, Szymon']","['Cwiklinska M', 'Czogala M', 'Kwiecinska K', 'Madetko-Talowska A', 'Szafarz M', 'Pawinska K', 'Wieczorek A', 'Klekawka T', 'Rej M', 'Stepien K', 'Halubiec P', 'Lazarczyk A', 'Miklusiak K', 'Bik-Multanowski M', 'Balwierz W', 'Skoczen S']","[""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Chair of Pediatrics, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmacokinetics and Physical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Group of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Group of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Group of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Chair of Pediatrics, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200616,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC7308427,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'genes', 'methotrexate', 'pharmacokinetics', 'polymorphism', 'toxicity']",,2020/07/03 06:00,2020/07/03 06:01,['2020/07/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2020.00307 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2020 Jun 16;8:307. doi: 10.3389/fped.2020.00307. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given their importance in immune-related diseases, cancer and obesity, there is increasing interest in targeting the Treg cell compartment therapeutically. New pharmacological inhibitors that specifically target the prosurvival protein MCL-1 may provide this opportunity, as Treg cells are particularly reliant upon this protein. However, there are two distinct isoforms of MCL-1; one located at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) that is required to antagonize apoptosis, and another at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that is reported to maintain IMM structure and metabolism via ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation. We set out to elucidate the relative importance of these distinct biological functions of MCL-1 in Treg cells to assess whether MCL-1 inhibition might impact upon the metabolism of cells able to resist apoptosis. Conditional deletion of Mcl1 in FOXP3(+) Treg cells resulted in a lethal multiorgan autoimmunity due to the depletion of the Treg cell compartment. This striking phenotype was completely rescued by concomitant deletion of the apoptotic effector proteins BAK and BAX, indicating that apoptosis plays a pivotal role in the homeostasis of Treg cells. Notably, MCL-1-deficient Treg cells rescued from apoptosis displayed normal metabolic capacity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of MCL-1 in Treg cells resistant to apoptosis did not perturb their metabolic function. We conclude that Treg cells require MCL-1 only to antagonize apoptosis and not for metabolism. Therefore, MCL-1 inhibition could be used to manipulate Treg cell survival for clinical benefit without affecting the metabolic fitness of cells resisting apoptosis.",,"['Teh, Charis E', 'Robbins, Alissa K', 'Henstridge, Darren C', 'Dewson, Grant', 'Diepstraten, Sarah T', 'Kelly, Gemma', 'Febbraio, Mark A', 'Gabriel, Sarah S', ""O'Reilly, Lorraine A"", 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Gray, Daniel H D']","['Teh CE', 'Robbins AK', 'Henstridge DC', 'Dewson G', 'Diepstraten ST', 'Kelly G', 'Febbraio MA', 'Gabriel SS', ""O'Reilly LA"", 'Strasser A', 'Gray DHD']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Cellular and Molecular Metabolism Laboratory, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, Launceston, TAS, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Cellular and Molecular Metabolism Laboratory, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Drug Discovery Biology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia. dgray@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia. dgray@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200701,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC7853142,,,,2020/07/03 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-020-0585-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-020-0585-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Dec;27(12):3374-3385. doi: 10.1038/s41418-020-0585-1.

However, many patients with both wild-type (WT) NUDT15 and TPMT still suffer from thiopurine toxicity and therapeutic failure. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was done for discovery (N = 244) and replication (N = 76) cohorts. Age- and sex-adjusted multiple regression analyses of both WT patients were performed to identify (p < 0.01, N = 188 for discovery) and validate (p < 0.05, N = 52 for replication) candidate variants for the tolerated last-cycle 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) dose intensity percentage (DIP). Both independent and additive effects of the candidate variants on well-known NUDT15 and TPMT were evaluated by multigene prediction models. RESULTS: Among the 12 candidate variants from the discovery phase, the rs3821169 variant of the gene encoding Cysteine-Rich Transmembrane BMP Regulator 1 (CRIM1) was successfully replicated (p < 0.05). It showed high interethnic variability with an impressively high allele frequency in East Asians (T = 0.255) compared to Africans (0.001), Americans (0.02), Europeans (0.009), and South Asians (0.05). Homozygote carriers of the CRIM1 rs3821169 variant (N = 12, 5%) showed significantly lower last-cycle 6-MP DIPs in the discovery, replication, and combined cohorts (p = 0.025, 0.013, and 0.001, respectively). The traditional two-gene model (NUDT15 and TPMT) for predicting 6-MP DIP < 25% was outperformed by the three-gene model that included CRIM1, in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.734 vs. 0.665), prediction accuracy (0.759 vs. 0.756), sensitivity (0.636 vs. 0.523), positive predictive value (0.315 vs. 0.288), and negative predictive value (0.931 vs. 0.913).

The first study on apigenin analyzed its effect on histamine release in the 1950s. Since then, anti-mutation and antitumor properties of apigenin have been widely reported. In the present study, we evaluated the apigenin-mediated amelioration of skin disease and investigated its applicability as a functional ingredient, especially in cosmetics. The effect of apigenin on RAW264.7 (murine macrophage), RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia), and HaCaT (human immortalized keratinocyte) cells were analyzed. Apigenin (100 muM) significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production, cytokine expression (interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL6, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]), and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal molecules, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) in RAW264.7 cells. Apigenin (30 M) also inhibited the phosphorylation of signaling molecules (Lyn, Syk, phospholipase Cgamma1, ERK, and JNK) and the expression of high-affinity IgE receptor FcepsilonRIalpha and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and COX-2) that are known to induce inflammation and allergic responses in RBL-2H3 cells. Further, apigenin (20 muM) significantly induced the expression of filaggrin, loricrin, aquaporin-3, hyaluronic acid, hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS)-1, HAS-2, and HAS-3 in HaCaT cells that are the main components of the physical barrier of the skin. Moreover, it promoted the expression of human beta-defensin (HBD)-1, HBD-2, HBD-3, and cathelicidin (LL-37) in HaCaT cells. These antimicrobial peptides are known to play an important role in the skin as chemical barriers. Apigenin significantly suppressed the inflammatory and allergic responses of RAW264.7 and RBL cells, respectively, and would, therefore, serve as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent for immune-related diseases. Apigenin could also be used to improve the functions of the physical and chemical skin barriers and to alleviate psoriasis, acne, and atopic dermatitis.",,"['Park, Che-Hwon', 'Min, Seon-Young', 'Yu, Hye-Won', 'Kim, Kyungmin', 'Kim, Suyeong', 'Lee, Hye-Ja', 'Kim, Ji-Hye', 'Park, Young-Jin']","['Park CH', 'Min SY', 'Yu HW', 'Kim K', 'Kim S', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim JH', 'Park YJ']","['Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero Chungju-si 27478, Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero Chungju-si 27478, Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero Chungju-si 27478, Korea.', 'Jeju R&D Center, AMI Cosmetics Co., Ltd., 16, Sancheondandong-gil, Jeju-si 63359, Korea.', 'Jeju R&D Center, AMI Cosmetics Co., Ltd., 16, Sancheondandong-gil, Jeju-si 63359, Korea.', 'Natural Products Laboratory, DAEBONG Life Science Co., Ltd., 213-4, Chumdan-Ro, Jeju-si 63309, Korea.', 'Natural Products Laboratory, DAEBONG Life Science Co., Ltd., 213-4, Chumdan-Ro, Jeju-si 63309, Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero Chungju-si 27478, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200629,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7370139,['NOTNLM'],"['HaCaT', 'RAW264.7', 'RBL-2H3', 'anti-allergy', 'anti-inflammation', 'apigenin', 'flavone']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2020/07/03 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/07/03 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21134620 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21134620 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 29;21(13). pii: ijms21134620. doi: 10.3390/ijms21134620.,"['P0002201/The Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy(MOTIE), Korea Institute for', 'Advancement of Technology(KIAT)']",13,,20210219,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', '0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apigenin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Filaggrin Proteins', 'HaCaT Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RAW 264.7 Cells/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Skin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Skin Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Skin Physiological Phenomena/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DDA triggers lethal autophagy in cancer cells through a biased activation of the oxysterol receptor LXRbeta, and the inhibition of a sterol isomerase. We hypothesize that DDA could potentiate the activity of an anticancer drug acting through a different molecular mechanism, and conducted in vitro and in vivo combination tests on AML cell lines and patient primary tumors. We report here results from tests combining DDA with antimetabolite cytarabine (Ara-C), one of the main drugs used for AML treatment worldwide. We demonstrated that DDA potentiated and sensitized AML cells, including primary patient samples, to Ara-C in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that this sensitization was LXRbeta-dependent and was due to the activation of lethal autophagy. This study demonstrates a positive in vitro and in vivo interaction between DDA and Ara-C, and supports the clinical evaluation of DDA in combination with Ara-C for the treatment of AML.",,"['Serhan,

Neoantigens are mutated peptides derived from somatic mutations not present in normal tissues that may result in the presentation of tumour-specific peptides capable of eliciting antitumour T-cell responses. Personalised neoantigen-based cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies have been shown to prime host immunity against tumour cells and are under clinical trial development. However, the optimisation and standardisation of neoantigen identification, as well as its delivery as immunotherapy are needed to increase tumour-specific T-cell responses and, thus, the clinical efficacy of current cancer immunotherapies. METHODS: In this recommendation article, launched by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), we outline and discuss the available framework for neoantigen prediction and present a systematic review of the current scientific evidence. RESULTS: A number of computational pipelines for neoantigen prediction are available. Most of them provide peptide major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding affinity predictions, but more recent approaches incorporate additional features like variant allele fraction, gene expression, and clonality of mutations. Neoantigens can be predicted in all cancer types with high and low tumour mutation burden, in part by exploiting tumour-specific aberrations derived from mutational frameshifts, splice variants, gene fusions, endogenous retroelements and other tumour-specific processes that could yield more potently immunogenic tumour neoantigens. Ongoing clinical trials will highlight those cancer types and combinations of immune therapies that would derive the most benefit from neoantigen-based immunotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Improved identification, selection and prioritisation of tumour-specific neoantigens are needed to increase the scope of benefit from cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies. Novel pipelines are being developed to resolve the challenges posed by high-throughput sequencing and to predict immunogenic neoantigens.","['Copyright (c) 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology.

NPM1 mutations represent the most common genetic lesion in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML; about one third of cases), and they act deterministically to cause the aberrant cytoplasmic delocalization of NPM1 mutants. Because of its unique features, NPM1-mutated AML is recognized as a distinct entity in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematopoietic neoplasms. Here, we focus on recently identified functions of wild-type NPM1 in the nucleolus and address new biological and clinical issues related to NPM1-mutated AML. The relevance of the cooperation between NPM1 and other mutations in driving AML with different outcomes is presented. We also discuss the importance of eradicating NPM1-mutated clones to achieve AML cure and the impact of preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis persistence in predisposing to second AML. The contribution of HOX genes' expression to the development of NPM1-mutated AML is also highlighted. Clinically, yet unsolved diagnostic issues in the 2017 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and the importance of NPM1 mutations in defining the framework of European LeukemiaNet genetic-based risk stratification are discussed.

It is unknown whether clinical dental screening to diagnose and treat odontogenic disease in these patients can reduce the incidence of dental emergencies. METHODS: Between November 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, we screened 147 patients with newly diagnosed AML before their admission for induction chemotherapy (n1 = 147, ""screened"" group). The patients not screened acted as controls (n2 = 190, ""unscreened"" group), as did patients diagnosed with AML in the 26 months before the initiation of the screening program (n3 = 304, ""prescreening"" group). The number of patients in each group who presented for emergency dental assessment during admission for induction chemotherapy was determined by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Among the 147 patients in the screened group, only 1 patient presented with an infectious odontogenic emergency (0.68% [95% CI, -0.64% to 1.98%]).

The expression level of LINC01268 in AML was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The viability, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis of AML cells were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The interaction between LINC01268 and miR-217 were predicted by the miRDB website, and then verified by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. The relationship between miR-217 and SOS1 was predicted by TargetScan website, and verified by luciferase reporter assay. LINC01268 was significantly upregulated by 1.6 fold in bone marrow samples of AML patients, which was associated with poor prognosis. LINC01268 was also significantly upregulated in AML cells. LINC01268 knockdown inhibited viability and cell cycle progression but promoted apoptosis of AML cells. Furthermore, LINC01268 functioned as a ceRNA via competitively binding to miR-217, and SOS1 was identified as a target of miR-217. Moreover, LINC01268 positively regulated SOS1 expression to promote AML cell viability and cell cycle progression but inhibited apoptosis via sponging miR-217. LINC01268 promoted cell growth and inhibited cell apoptosis through modulating miR-217/SOS1 axis in AML. This study offers a novel molecular mechanism for a better understanding of the pathology of AML.

Early palliative care (PC) has been shown to improve EOL care outcomes, but its benefits are less established in HM than in solid tumors. Objectives: We sought to describe the use of billed PC services among Medicare beneficiaries with HM. We hypothesized that receipt of early PC services (rendered >30 days before death) may be associated with less aggressive EOL care. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis Setting/Subjects: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare registry, we studied patients with leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasm who died between 2001 and 2015. Measurements: We described trends in the use of PC services and evaluated the association between early PC services and metrics of EOL care aggressiveness. Results: Among 139,191 decedents, the proportion receiving PC services increased from 0.4% in 2001 to 13.3% in 2015. Median time from first encounter to death was 10 days and 84.3% of encounters occurred during hospitalizations. In patients who survived >30 days from diagnosis (N = 120,741), the use of early PC services was more frequent in acute leukemia, women, and black patients, among other characteristics. Early PC services were associated with increased hospice use and decreased health care utilization at the EOL. Conclusion: Among patients with HM, there was an upward trend in PC services, and early PC services were associated with less aggressive EOL care.

An unanticipated impact of an intravenous sodium bicarbonate drug shortage.,e28334,10.1002/pbc.28334 [doi],"BACKGROUND: National drug shortages of essential medications for childhood cancer have increasingly posed a challenge in the treatment of patients. The efficacy of standardized supportive care practices to avoid treatment-related toxicities may be limited during these drug shortages. High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) plays a critical role in modern treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and requires stringent supportive care measures to mitigate toxicity. As the result of a national intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate shortage, institutional standard HDMTX supportive care guidelines had to be modified. We describe the unanticipated consequences on HDMTX clearance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review assessing the impact of alternative compositions of IV fluids on the mean 24-h methotrexate levels (Cpss ) of 25 patients receiving 76 total HDMTX infusions at Texas Children's Hospital Cancer Center from March to October 2017. During the sodium bicarbonate drug shortage, all patients received IV hydration consisting of either dextrose 5%, 0.45% normal saline (D5 (1/2) NS-Group A) or dextrose 5%, 0.2% normal saline (D5 (1/4) NS-Group B). RESULTS: Patients receiving a higher total sodium dose demonstrated significantly lower Cpss (25.36 +/- 16.6 muMol) compared to patients receiving less sodium (53.9 +/- 37.9 muMol; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that in the setting of IV sodium bicarbonate shortage, the composition of hydration IV fluids may affect methotrexate clearance. Patient who received a higher sodium load had a lower 24-h methotrexate level. This demonstrates the potential for unanticipated outcomes resulting from national drug shortages.","['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mangum, Ross', 'Bernhardt, M Brooke', 'Cheng, W Susan', 'Schafer, Eric S', 'Berg, Stacey L', 'Foster, Jennifer H']","['Mangum R', 'Bernhardt MB', 'Cheng WS', 'Schafer ES', 'Berg SL', 'Foster JH']","[""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Public Heath, Benedictine University, Lisle, Illinois.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200701,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy', '*drug shortages', '*methotrexate clearance']",,2020/07/02 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28334 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Sep;67(9):e28334. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28334.

Recently, many studies have revealed that the Maillard reaction (MR) affects the allergenicity of food proteins. RESULTS: To investigate the influence of the MR on the allergenicity of Ara h 1, R-Ara h 1 was processed with glucose in dry heating conditions for different periods. The extent of the MR was assessed by four methods. The changes in secondary and tertiary structures were characterized through spectroscopy assays. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) structures were identified by protein sample dry heating for 60 min, indicating the formation of AGE-Ara h 1. Simulated gastric fluid (SGF) digestion analysis showed that AGE-Ara h 1 has higher resistance to peptic digestion than R-Ara h 1. The BALB/c mouse model was also utilized to explore the effect of the MR on the allergenicity of Ara h 1, and the results showed that the Th2-type cytokines, antibodies, and histamine content increased, and there was a greater degree of degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells in the AGE-Ara h 1 group compared with the R-Ara h 1 group. CONCLUSION: During the process of dry heating, proteins participated in the MR with changes in secondary and tertiary structures. The condition applying a temperature of 100 degrees C for 60 min caused the formation of AGE-Ara h 1. Simulated gastric fluid digestion analysis showed that AGE-Ara h 1 had a greater resistance to peptic digestion than R-Ara h 1. The BALB/c mouse model showed that AGE-Ara h 1 had more allergenicity, indicating that the MR could enhance the allergenicity of Ara h 1.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional and retrospective study, conducted from 2014 to 2018 in which profiles of molecular and immunophenotypic aberrations were investigated in children and adolescents diagnosed with acute leukemia, by evaluating 28 molecular abnormalities by HemaVision-Q28 multiplex RT-PCR kit and standardized EuroFlow Immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells. RESULTS: We included 218 patients, with 82.5% younger than 14 years and 17.5% adolescents. The median age was 9 years and a main peak of incidence was recorded at age of 4 to 5 years. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in 70.64% of all cases, acute myeloid leukemia was in 22.48%, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 6.42%, and mixed lineage acute leukemia in 0.46% of cases. Overall, chromosomal translocations were positive in 29.82% of cases. While 65.31% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia reported aberrancies, only in 18.83% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases genetic abnormalities were obvious. Surprisingly, most prevalent translocations in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were t(9;22) in 20.7%, followed by t(4;11) in 17.2% and t(6;11) in 13.8%, whereas patients with acute myeloid leukemia showed t(15;17) in 40.6% and t(8;21) in 21.9%. In contrast, an homogeneous expression of t(3;21) and t(6;11) was recorded for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mixed lineage acute leukemia cases, respectively. Except for t(1;19), expressed only by pre-B cells, there was no association of any of the studied translocations with differentiation stages of the B-leukemic developmental pathway. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify near 50% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at debut with high-risk translocations and poor prognosis in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as an unexpected increase of acute myeloid leukemia cases in young children, suggesting a molecular shift that support a higher incidence of poor prognosis cases in Oaxaca.",,"['Juarez-Avendano, Gerardo', 'Luna-Silva, Nuria Citlalli', 'Chargoy-Vivaldo, Euler', 'Juarez-Martinez, Laura Alicia', 'Martinez-Rangel, Mayra Noemi', 'Zarate-Ortiz, Noemi', 'Martinez-Valencia, Edith', 'Lopez-Martinez, Briceida', 'Pelayo, Rosana', 'Balandran, Juan Carlos']","['Juarez-Avendano G', 'Luna-Silva NC', 'Chargoy-Vivaldo E', 'Juarez-Martinez LA', 'Martinez-Rangel MN', 'Zarate-Ortiz N', 'Martinez-Valencia E', 'Lopez-Martinez B', 'Pelayo R', 'Balandran JC']","['Laboratorio Juarez, Medicina de Laboratorio Clinico de Alta Especialidad, Biologia Molecular e Investigacion Clinica, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital de la Ninez Oaxaquena ""Doctor Guillermo Zarate Mijangos"", Secretaria de Salud, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Regional Presidente Juarez ISSSTE, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio Juarez, Medicina de Laboratorio Clinico de Alta Especialidad, Biologia Molecular e Investigacion Clinica, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Residente de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital General de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio Juarez, Medicina de Laboratorio Clinico de Alta Especialidad, Biologia Molecular e Investigacion Clinica, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio Juarez, Medicina de Laboratorio Clinico de Alta Especialidad, Biologia Molecular e Investigacion Clinica, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio Juarez, Medicina de Laboratorio Clinico de Alta Especialidad, Biologia Molecular e Investigacion Clinica, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Secretaria de Salud, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social Delegacion Puebla, Metepec-Atlixco, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio Juarez, Medicina de Laboratorio Clinico de Alta Especialidad, Biologia Molecular e Investigacion Clinica, Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,PMC7340349,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*childhood leukemia', '*chromosomal translocations', '*leukemia immunophenotypes']",,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820928436 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820928436. doi: 10.1177/1533033820928436.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1978-248X'],20211124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is highly expressed by AML cells, actively mediating chemoresistance and reoccurrence. Herein, a chemically synthesized CXCR4 antagonistic peptide E5 is fabricated to micelle formulation (M-E5) and applied to refractory AML mice, and its therapeutic effects and pharmacokinetics are investigated. Results show that M-E5 can effectively block the surface CXCR4 in leukemic cells separated from bone marrow (BM) and spleen, and inhibit the C-X-C chemokine ligand 12-mediated migration. Subcutaneous administration of M-E5 significantly inhibits the engraftment of leukemic cells in spleen and BM, and mobilizes residue leukemic cells into peripheral blood, reducing organs' burden and significantly prolonging the survival of AML mice. M-E5 can also increase the efficacy of combining regime of homoharringtonine and doxorubicin. Ribonucleic acid sequencing demonstrates that the therapeutic effect is contributed by inhibiting proliferation and enhancing apoptosis and differentiation, all related to the CXCR4 signaling blockade. M-E5 reaches the concentration peak at 2 h after administration with a half-life of 14.5 h in blood. In conclusion, M-E5 is a novel promising therapeutic candidate for refractory AML treatment.","['(c) 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

At the same time, unique toxicities have emerged, and without early intervention, are life-threatening. This article will review the novel therapies in acute leukemias and highlight the clinically relevant supportive care advances. RECENT FINDINGS: The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) has put forth the most recent recommendations in managing the cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity after chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and blinatumomab. The hepatic injury incurred by inotuzumab, and the vascular toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, other relatively novel agents, require subspecialist intervention and multidisciplinary care. Asparaginase, a long-established and key element of pediatric regimens, has made a comeback in the young adult leukemia population. Updated guidelines have been outlined for management of asparaginase thrombotic complications. Lastly, although there have been few changes in the applications of growth factor, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and management of neuropathy, these encompass exceedingly important aspects of care. While the rapidly changing treatment paradigms for acute lymphoblastic leukemia have transformed leukemia-specific outcomes, treatment emergent toxicities have forced much necessary attention to better definitions of these toxicities and on improving supportive care guidelines in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,"['Cook, Joselle', 'Litzow, Mark']","['Cook J', 'Litzow M']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. litzow.mark@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Asparaginase', '*Blinatumomab', '*CAR-T', '*Inotuzumab', '*Supportive care', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2020/07/02 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00585-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00585-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Aug;15(4):276-293. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00585-2.,,4,,20201221,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/mortality/therapy', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to further substantiate the involvement of BIS protein in the astroglial reaction in the striatum of rats treated with the mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid. Weak constitutive immunoreactivity for BIS was observed in astrocytes in the control striatum, whereas its expression was upregulated, along with that of nestin, in the lesioned striatum. In the lesion core, where astrocytes are virtually absent, BIS/nestin double-labeled cells were associated with the vasculature and were identified as perivascular adventitial fibroblasts. By contrast, BIS/nestin double-labeled cells in the perilesional area were reactive astrocytes, which were confined to the border zone contributing to the formation of the astroglial scar; this was evident 3 days post-lesion and increased thereafter progressively throughout the 28-day experimental period. At the ultrastructural level, BIS protein was diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm within the stained cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of BIS-positive cells in the lesioned striatum, suggesting the involvement of BIS in the formation of astroglial scar and its potential role in the development of fibrotic scar after brain insults.",,"['Riew, Tae-Ryong', 'Kim, Soojin', 'Jin, Xuyan', 'Kim, Hong Lim', 'Yoo, Kyunghyun', 'Seo, Sung Bin', 'Lee, Jeong-Hwa', 'Lee, Mun-Yong']","['Riew TR', 'Kim S', 'Jin X', 'Kim HL', 'Yoo K', 'Seo SB', 'Lee JH', 'Lee MY']","['Department of Anatomy, Catholic Neuroscience Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Catholic Neuroscience Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Catholic Neuroscience Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Integrative Research Support Center, Laboratory of Electron Microscope, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'The Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'The Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. leejh@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. leejh@catholic.ac.kr.', 'The Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. leejh@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Department of Anatomy, Catholic Neuroscience Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. munylee@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. munylee@catholic.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200630,United States,Mol Neurobiol,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,,['NOTNLM'],"['Astroglial scar', 'BIS', 'Fibrotic scar', 'Nestin', 'Reactive astrocytes']",,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12035-020-02000-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12035-020-02000-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Neurobiol. 2020 Sep;57(9):3846-3859. doi: 10.1007/s12035-020-02000-6.

Some of these paraneoplasms manifest as cutaneous lesions, appearing as a simple rash, ulcers or skin thickening. The pathogenesis for this process has been described as development of certain autoimmune reactions against cell wall antigens and proteins. An example is paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) which manifests as cutaneous bullae. Bullae may occur anytime during the course of the malignancy i.e. acute phase or remission. Diagnosis involves evaluation of clinical findings, serology and presence of characteristic histological findings. Its pathogenesis is described as development of auto-antibodies against cell junctional and basement membrane proteins. Presence of paraneoplasms has been associated with poorer prognosis and increased mortality in hematological malignancies including CLL.

Considerable research has been conducted in patients with acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML) with the aim of correlating body mass index (BMI) and outcomes in patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematological diseases. In adults, a high BMI has been associated with increased leukemia-related mortality. Whether a similar effect exists in the pediatric setting remains controversial. Some of the studies detailed in this review have reported no differences in outcomes according to BMI, whilst other reports have described higher treatment-related mortality, increased risk of relapse and death. Although the link between BMI and acute leukemia outcomes is controversial, a large number of studies describe poorer survival rates in children with AML or ALL with higher BMI.

The mechanisms underlying Skp2 in the promotion of proliferation and its function in the primary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in human CML remain to be determined. This study aimed to investigate the function of Skp2 in CML progression as well as its effects on TKI sensitivity. Methods: Expression of Skp2 in leukocytes from patients with CML and normal blood samples was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation was analyzed by EdU incorporation and cell counting assays. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used for examination of the effects of CREB on Skp2 expression. The apoptosis in vitro of K562 cells was analyzed by MTT and caspase 3/7 activity assays. Results: The present study demonstrates that Skp2 was expressed at a higher level in patients with CML compared with healthy donors, and the elevated expression of Skp2 is critical for CML cell proliferation. Mechanistically, Skp2 was transcriptionally upregulated by CREB responsive to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of Skp2 expression by shRNAs or blocking the PI3K/Akt/CREB pathway greatly enhances the sensitivity of CML cells to Imatinib treatment. Conclusion: We conclude that the PI3K/Akt/CREB axis regulates the sensitivity of K562 cells to Imatinib via mediating Skp2 expression. The present study revealed an unknown role of Skp2 in CML progression and provided new aspects on the Skp2-modulated TKI sensitivity in CML, contributing to the development of potential therapeutic anticancer drugs.",['(c) 2020 Chen et al.'],"['Chen, Xiaowen', 'Huang, Zhenqi', 'Wu, Wei', 'Xia, Ruixiang']","['Chen X', 'Huang Z', 'Wu W', 'Xia R']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230022, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230022, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230022, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230022, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200622,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC7319929,['NOTNLM'],"['CREB', 'Imatinib', 'PI3K/Akt', 'Skp2']",['The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2020/07/02 06:00,2020/07/02 06:01,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S253367 [doi]', '253367 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Jun 22;12:4777-4787. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S253367. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: Patients with liver cancer admitted to the Second People's Hospital of Liaocheng were included in this study. We transfected hepatocellular carcinoma cells with MT1JP and miR-24-3p and assessed their expression and effects on apoptosis and migration. Correlations were verified using a dual-luciferase reporter and RNA-binding protein coimmunoprecipitation. Results: The expression of MT1JP was downregulated (P < 0.05), whereas that of miR-24-3p was upregulated in liver cancer. Serum MT1JP levels were correlated with tumor size, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), TNM stage, differentiation, and lymph node metastasis. Both MT1JP overexpression and miR-24-3p inhibition inhibited cellular proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis rates. They significantly downregulated expression of the cell migration-associated proteins matrix metalloproteinase -2, -9 (MMP-2, MMP-9) (P < 0.05). They upregulated the expression of Bcl-2-related X protein (Bax) and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinases (Caspase-3 and -9) proteins that are involved in apoptosis. They decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2; P < 0.05). A target relationship between MT1JP and miR-24-3p was identified using dual-luciferase gene reporter assays and RNA-binding protein coimmunoprecipitations. MT1JP overexpression significantly downregulated miR-24-3p expression (P < 0.05). MT1JP and miR-24-3p expression were negatively correlated in liver cancer tissues (r = -0.561, P < 0.001; Pearson chi(2) tests). Rescue experiments showed that upregulating miR-24-3p expression could counteract MT1JP overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Conclusion: MT1JP, even when expressed at low levels, participates in the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of liver cancer cells by regulating miR-24-3p.",['(c) 2020 Shan et al.'],"['Shan, Qiu-Li', 'Chen, Ning-Ning', 'Meng, Gui-Zhi', 'Qu, Fan']","['Shan QL', 'Chen NN', 'Meng GZ', 'Qu F']","[""College of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan, Shandong Province 250022, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan, Shandong Province 250022, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Second People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan, Shandong Province 250022, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200618,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC7308148,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'liver cancer', 'lncRNA MT1JP', 'miR-24-3p', 'migration']",['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare regarding this study.'],2020/07/02 06:00,2020/07/02 06:01,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S249582 [doi]', '249582 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Jun 18;12:4715-4724. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S249582. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard treatment for newly diagnosed AML is chemotherapy consisting of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and anthracyclines with disappointing clinical outcomes and severe adverse effects, such as symptomatic bradycardia, neurotoxicity. Thus, it is promising to treat AML through combination drug therapy to reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapeutics. In our recent published PNAS paper, we reported that NK-1R antagonists, both Aprepitant and SR140333, induce apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells by inducing oxidative stress through mitochondrial calcium overload. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis of the combination Ara-C with NK-1R antagonist could enhance the efficacy of Ara-C. Methods: MTT assay was employed to detect the cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was applied to detect the cell cycle and necrosis. PI uptake and LDH release assay were used to detect the disintegration of the plasma membrane. Xenograft model was constructed to explore the effect of combination Ara-C with Aprepitant in vivo. Results: Our results showed that Aprepitant sensitizes HL60 cells to the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C more than 5-fold by enhancing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and necrosis in vitro. Furthermore, Nec-1, a specific inhibitor of necroptosis, could recover the cell proliferative viability significantly. Attractively, once every 2-days regimen of Ara-C (5 mg/kg) and Aprepitant (10 mg/kg) via in situ injection dramatically reduced the tumor volume from 2175.0 +/- 341.9 mm(3) in the vehicle group to 828.4 +/- 232.4 mm(3) in the combination group without obvious toxicity in human myeloid leukemia xenograft mice. Conclusion: Taken together, reduced dose of Ara-C combination with moderate Aprepitant provides more effective therapeutical methods for AML treatment in vitro and in vivo with the elimination of the toxicity of Ara-C, which may pay new avenue for the usage of the routine chemotherapy drug Ara-C with low dose to enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity in clinical practice.",['(c) 2020 Wu et al.'],"['Wu, Hongzhang', 'Cheng, Xurui', 'Huang, Feiyan', 'Shao, Gang', 'Meng, Yueming', 'Wang, Lingfei', 'Wang, Tao', 'Jia, Xiaoyuan', 'Yang, Tianxin', 'Wang, Xi', 'Fu, Caiyun']","['Wu H', 'Cheng X', 'Huang F', 'Shao G', 'Meng Y', 'Wang L', 'Wang T', 'Jia X', 'Yang T', 'Wang X', 'Fu C']","[""Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310006, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The 903rd Hospital of PLA, Hangzhou 310013, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The 903rd Hospital of PLA, Hangzhou 310013, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Province People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The 903rd Hospital of PLA, Hangzhou 310013, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactor and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200618,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC7308242,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'combined chemotherapy', 'cytosine arabinoside', 'neurokinin receptor antagonist']",['The authors declare no competing financial interests exist.'],2020/07/02 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S244648 [doi]', '244648 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 Jun 18;14:2413-2422. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S244648. eCollection 2020.,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1068-6790', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8517-9828', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4090-885X']",20210330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1NF15YR6UY (Aprepitant)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aprepitant/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The databases of the Departments of Hematology and Oncology of the University Hospitals of Jena and Rostock were screened for patients aged 18 years or older for onset of MS after HSCT for myeloid malignancies between 2002 and 2019. Nineteen patients with MS were identified, the majority of whom had received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). The median onset of MS was 425 days after HSCT and the median overall survival since MS was 234 days. Although MS is associated with a poor prognosis, three patients survived more than two years and one more than 11 years after MS onset. These results indicate that RIC protocols may be associated with a higher risk of EM relapse. Since EM relapse occurred in the presence of Graft-versus-host-disease, these observations also demonstrate the limitations of graft-versus-tumor effects after HSCT.

There is evidence for BCMA expression in various hematologic malignancies, suggesting that BCMA may play an important role as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these diseases. Given advances in understanding the role of BCMA in B-cell development and the promise of BCMA as a therapeutic target, a systematic review is needed to rigorously assess the evidence for BCMA expression and identify areas of consensus and future research. The objective of this review was to summarize the evidence on BCMA protein and mRNA expression across hematologic malignancies. Using a PubMed database search up to 28 August 2019, a systematic literature review of publications reporting BCMA expression in patients with hematologic malignancies was conducted. Data from published congress abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology were also searched. Studies that assessed BCMA expression (protein or mRNA) in patients of any age with hematologic malignancies were included. A total of 21 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. BCMA was expressed in several hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin lymphoma. BCMA was expressed at uniformly high levels across all 13 MM studies and at low to moderate levels in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results suggest that BCMA is a relevant target in MM as well as in a subset of B-cell leukemia. BCMA expression in Hodgkin lymphoma and NHL varied across studies, and further research is needed to determine the utility of BCMA as an antibody target and biomarker in these diseases. Differences in sample type, timing of sample collection, and laboratory technique used may have affected the reporting of BCMA levels.",,"['Dogan, Ahmet', 'Siegel, David', 'Tran, Nguyet', 'Fu, Alan', 'Fowler, Jessica', 'Belani, Rajesh', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Dogan A', 'Siegel D', 'Tran N', 'Fu A', 'Fowler J', 'Belani R', 'Landgren O']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. dogana@mskcc.org.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.', 'Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200630,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC7327051,,,,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-0337-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-0337-y [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Jun 30;10(6):73. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-0337-y.,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],6,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6576-5256', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6485-4839']",20210510,"['0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Cell Maturation Antigen/analysis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very little is known about the effect of HSPG2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the HSPG2 gene in terms of overall survival and leukemia-free survival in patients with AML. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 4 AML patients and 3 healthy controls were processed for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq). The mRNA expression level of HSPG2 in BMMCs and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from enrolled participants and human leukemic cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. Then the correlations between the expression of HSPG2 and a variety of important clinical parameters, such as median white blood cell (WBC) count and bone marrow (BM) blasts, were further analyzed. The expression level of HSPG2 was significantly upregulated in AML patients at the time of diagnosis, downregulated after complete remission and then elevated again at relapse. Moreover, HSPG2 expression was associated with median WBC count (P < 0.001), median hemoglobin (P = 0.02), median platelet count (P = 0.001), and BM blasts (P < 0.001) in AML patients. Patients with high HSPG2 expression had both worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and poorer leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P = 0.047). In the multivariate analysis model, HSPG2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of AML. Taken together, these results indicate that HSPG2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and may be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of AML.",,"['Zhou, Xiaojia', 'Liang, Simin', 'Zhan, Qian', 'Yang, Li', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Li']","['Zhou X', 'Liang S', 'Zhan Q', 'Yang L', 'Chi J', 'Wang L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Karaiskakio Foundation, 2032, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. liwangls@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200630,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC7327006,,,,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2694-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2694-7 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jun 30;11(6):492. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2694-7.,,6,,20210318,"['0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '143972-95-6 (perlecan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'ROC Curve', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRL3 is expressed in a large fraction of primary human T-ALLs and is commonly co-amplified with MYC. PRL3 also synergized with MYC to initiate early-onset ALL in transgenic zebrafish and was required for human T-ALL growth and maintenance. Mass-spectrometry phosphoproteomic analysis and mechanistic studies uncovered that PRL3 suppresses downstream T-cell phosphorylation signaling pathways, including those modulated by VAV1, and subsequently suppresses apoptosis in leukemia cells. Taken together, our studies have identified new roles for PRL3 as a collaborating oncogenic driver in human T-ALL and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the PRL3 phosphatase will likely be a useful

Leukemias initiating in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are less sensitive to chemotherapy and highly express the transcription factor MECOM (EVI1) compared with leukemias derived from myeloid progenitors. Here, we compared leukemias initiated in either HSCs or myeloid progenitors to reveal a novel function for EVI1 in modulating p53 protein abundance and activity. HSC-derived leukemias exhibit decreased apoptotic priming, attenuated p53 transcriptional output, and resistance to lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors in addition to classical genotoxic stresses. p53 loss of function in Evi1 (lo) progenitor-derived leukemias induces resistance to LSD1 inhibition, and EVI1(hi) leukemias are sensitized to LSD1 inhibition by venetoclax. Our findings demonstrate a role for EVI1 in p53 wild-type cancers in reducing p53 function and provide a strategy to circumvent drug resistance in chemoresistant EVI1 (hi) acute myeloid leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that the cell of origin of leukemia initiation influences p53 activity and dictates therapeutic sensitivity to pharmacologic LSD1 inhibitors via the transcription factor EVI1. We show that drug resistance could be overcome in HSC-derived leukemias by combining LSD1 inhibition with venetoclax.See related commentary by Gu et al., p. 1445.This article is highlighted in the In

However, off-target toxicities of these inhibitors are well-described, and resistance has become a paramount concern. Novel allosteric inhibitors of the Abelson (ABL) family of tyrosine kinases, including GNF-2, GNF-5, and ABL-001, are equipped to overcome these issues. Several contemporary studies have demonstrated their potential efficacy in three key areas: primary hematologic and solid malignancies, metastasis, and combination with other small molecules. Further, ongoing clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of ABL-001 for the treatment of CML and recurrent solid tumors. This work reviews the current literature of the preclinical testing of GNF-2 and GNF-5 and the preclinical and clinical testing of ABL-001.

RNA methylation fine tunes RNA stability and translation, altering cell fate. The fat mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is an m(6)A demethylase with oncogenic properties in leukemia. Here, we show that FTO expression is suppressed in ovarian tumors and cancer stem cells (CSC). FTO inhibited the self-renewal of ovarian CSC and suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo, both of which required FTO demethylase activity. Integrative RNA sequencing and m(6)A mapping analysis revealed significant transcriptomic changes associated with FTO overexpression and m(6)A loss involving stem cell signaling, RNA transcription, and mRNA splicing pathways. By reducing m(6)A levels at the 3'UTR and the mRNA stability of two phosphodiesterase genes (PDE1C and PDE4B), FTO augmented second messenger 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling and suppressed stemness features of ovarian cancer cells. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated tumor suppressor function of FTO in ovarian CSC mediated through inhibition of cAMP signaling.

Despite recent progress in diagnosis and treatment, long-term outcome remains unsatisfactory. The success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation underscores the immunoresponsive nature of AML, creating the basis for further exploiting immunotherapies. However, emerging evidence suggests that AML, similar to other malignant entities, employs a variety of mechanisms to evade immunosurveillance. In light of this, T-cell inhibitory myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are gaining interest as key facilitators of immunoescape. Accumulation of CD14(+)HLA-DR(low) monocytic MDSCs has been described in newly diagnosed AML patients, and deciphering the underlying mechanisms could help to improve anti-AML immunity. Here, we report that conventional monocytes readily take-up AML-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) and subsequently undergo MDSC differentiation. They acquired an CD14(+)HLA-DR(low) phenotype, expressed the immunomodulatory indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, and upregulated expression of genes characteristic for MDSCs, such as S100A8/9 and cEBPbeta. The Akt/mTOR pathway played a critical role in the AML-EV-induced phenotypical and functional transition of monocytes. Generated MDSCs displayed a glycolytic switch, which rendered them more susceptible toward glycolytic inhibitors. Furthermore, palmitoylated proteins on the AML-EV surface activated Toll-like receptor 2 as the initiating event of Akt/mTOR-dependent induction of MDSC. Therefore, targeting protein palmitoylation in AML blasts could block MDSC accumulation to improve immune responses. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that targeting protein palmitoylation in AML could interfere with the leukemogenic potential and block MDSC accumulation to improve immunity.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Tohumeken, Sehmus', 'Baur, Rebecca', 'Bottcher, Martin', 'Stoll, Andrej', 'Loschinski, Romy', 'Panagiotidis, Konstantinos', 'Braun, Martina', 'Saul, Domenica', 'Volkl, Simon', 'Baur, Andreas S', 'Bruns, Heiko', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Jitschin, Regina', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Tohumeken S', 'Baur R', 'Bottcher M', 'Stoll A', 'Loschinski R', 'Panagiotidis K', 'Braun M', 'Saul D', 'Volkl S', 'Baur AS', 'Bruns H', 'Mackensen A', 'Jitschin R', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany. dimitrios.mougiakakos@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200630,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,,,,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-20-0024 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0024 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2020 Sep 1;80(17):3663-3676. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0024.

Analysis of knockout mice revealed critical roles for JMJD1 proteins in fertility, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease. Importantly, a plethora of studies demonstrated that especially JMJD1A and JMJD1C are overexpressed in various tumors, stimulate cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and facilitate efficient tumor growth. However, JMJD1A may also inhibit the formation of germ cell tumors. Likewise, JMJD1B appears to be a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia, but a tumor promoter in other cancers. Notably, by reducing methylation levels on histone H3 lysine 9, JMJD1 proteins can profoundly alter the transcriptome and thereby affect tumorigenesis, including through upregulating oncogenes such as CCND1, JUN, and MYC This epigenetic activity of JMJD1 proteins is sensitive to heavy metals, oncometabolites, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species, whose levels are frequently altered within cancer cells. In conclusion, inhibition of JMJD1 enzymatic activity through small molecules is predicted to be beneficial in many different cancers, but not in the few malignancies where JMJD1 proteins apparently exert tumor-suppressive functions.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Sui, Yuan', 'Gu, Ruicai', 'Janknecht, Ralf']","['Sui Y', 'Gu R', 'Janknecht R']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. ralf-janknecht@ouhsc.edu.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Stephenson Cancer Center, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20200630,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,PMC7772267,,,,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-20-0404 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0404 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2021 Jan;19(1):3-13. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0404.

Therefore, we investigated the combined effect of an inhibitor of STAT3 and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in a murine model of glioma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: C57BL/6 mice underwent intracerebral implantation of GL261 glioma cells, WBRT, and treatment with WP1066, a blood-brain barrier-penetrant inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway, or the two in combination. The role of the immune system was evaluated using tumor rechallenge strategies, immune-incompetent backgrounds, immunofluorescence, immune phenotyping of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (via flow cytometry), and NanoString gene expression analysis of 770 immune-related genes from immune cells, including those directly isolated from the tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: The combination of WP1066 and WBRT resulted in long-term survivors and enhanced median survival time relative to monotherapy in the GL261 glioma model (combination vs. control P < 0.0001). Immunologic memory appeared to be induced, because mice were protected during subsequent tumor rechallenge. The therapeutic effect of the combination was completely lost in immune-incompetent animals. NanoString analysis and immunofluorescence revealed immunologic reprograming in the CNS tumor microenvironment specifically affecting dendritic cell antigen presentation and T-cell effector functions. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the combination of STAT3 inhibition and WBRT enhances the therapeutic effect against gliomas in the CNS by inducing dendritic cell and T-cell interactions in the CNS tumor.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Ott, Martina', 'Kassab, Cynthia', 'Marisetty, Anantha', 'Hashimoto, Yuuri', 'Wei, Jun', 'Zamler, Daniel', 'Leu, Jia-Shiun', 'Tomaszowski, Karl-Heinz', 'Sabbagh, Aria', 'Fang, Dexing', 'Gupta, Pravesh', 'Priebe, Waldemar', 'Zielinski, Rafal J', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Long, James P', 'Kong, Ling-Yuan', 'Fuller, Gregory N', 'DeGroot, John', 'Sulman, Erik P', 'Heimberger, Amy B']","['Ott M', 'Kassab C', 'Marisetty A', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Wei J', 'Zamler D', 'Leu JS', 'Tomaszowski KH', 'Sabbagh A', 'Fang D', 'Gupta P', 'Priebe W', 'Zielinski RJ', 'Burks JK', 'Long JP', 'Kong LY', 'Fuller GN', 'DeGroot J', 'Sulman EP', 'Heimberger AB']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neuropathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, NYU Langone Health Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. aheimber@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200630,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,,,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-4092 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-4092 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Sep 15;26(18):4983-4994. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-4092.

The extent to which these contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) incidence is not well understood. We sought to evaluate the association between urban-rural status and racial and ethnic disparities in the 3 major NHL subtypes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used data on NHL incidence from 21 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based registries for the period 2000 to 2016. Population characteristics were compared by NHL subtype and urban-rural status, using rural-urban continuum codes from the US Department of Agriculture. Incidence rate ratios were calculated, and Poisson regression was used to assess the association between incidence and rurality. RESULTS: A total of 136,197 DLBCL, 70,882 FL, and 120,319 CLL incident cases aged >/= 20 years were reported. The majority of DLBCL patients were non-Hispanic white (73.5%), with 11.9% Hispanic and 7.3% non-Hispanic black, with a similar distribution observed in FL and CLL. Adjusting for age, sex, and family poverty, we found increased DLBCL incidence among Hispanics in increasingly urban areas compared to rural areas (rural incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.00; nonmetropolitan urban IRR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.16, 1.51; metropolitan urban IRR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.36, 1.76). Among non-Hispanic blacks, urban areas, relative to rural areas, were associated with increased CLL incidence (IRR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.27, 1.72). CONCLUSION: Urban-rural incidence patterns suggest that environmental exposures in urban areas associated with DLBCL and CLL pathogenesis may disproportionately affect Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

New guidelines emphasize fertility preservation in young adolescents, but the impact of these guidelines is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the rate of fertility preservation among at-risk adolescents diagnosed with cancer at our institution, as well as evaluate barriers to fertility preservation. DESIGN: We performed an IRB-approved historical cohort study of adolescent males 13 years and older evaluated in the Pediatric Hematology-Oncology clinic at Doernbecher Children's Hospital from 2010 to 2018. Electronic chart review was used assess discussion of fertility preservation and barrier to successful preservation in boys with a new diagnosis of cancer who received systemic chemotherapy and/or gonadal or pelvic irradiation. RESULTS: 82 boys were included in the study. Forty-two (51%) received counselling about fertility preservation, and of those 29 (70%) successfully banked sperm. Neither counseling for fertility preservation nor success at sperm banking differed by patient age, but both differed by malignancy. Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma had the highest rate of counselling, while those with leukemia had the lowest. Acute illness as a barrier to preservation was found in 40% of those who did not receive counselling. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates a stagnant rate of fertility counseling and preservation despite increased advocacy. The retrospective nature of our study limited our ability to assess the counselling that occurred, and the lack of granular race data limited study of the implicit selection bias that may be involved in such counseling. As more institutions move toward a multi-disciplinary care model, we believe that pediatric urologists or fertility specialists must play a vocal role in the care of these at-risk adolescents. CONCLUSION: Despite increasing advocacy for fertility preservation, our data shows no significant change in previously reported trends. Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma have a higher rate of counseling and cryopreservation in comparison to those with other malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company.

The contamination of avian leukosis virus (ALV) in attenuated vaccine is considered as one of the possible transmission routes of this disease. Based on a retrospective survey of 918 batches of attenuated vaccine produced before 2010, three of them were identified as ALV-positive and corresponding ALV strains were successfully isolated from a live Fowlpox virus vaccine, a live Newcastle disease virus vaccine and a live Infectious Bursal Disease virus vaccine, respectively, and whole-genome sequencing showed that these three isolates shared the highest homology with ALV-A wild strains isolated in China (97.7%) over the same period, and the phylogenetic analysis based on their gp85 genes further confirmed that they belong to subgroup A. Meanwhile, although these three ALV-A strains isolated from contaminated vaccines shared a close genetic relationship, their U3 region of genome have a relatively low identity, suggesting that these three strains may have different sources.

Here, we describe studies to validate the analytical performance of the assay using patient samples and cell lines. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity were established by defining the limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantitation (LoQ) and limit of blank (LoB) in genomic DNA (gDNA) from 66 patients with multiple myeloma (MM), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and three cell lines. Healthy donor gDNA was used as a diluent to contrive samples with specific DNA masses and malignant-cell frequencies. Precision was validated using a range of samples contrived from patient gDNA, healthy donor gDNA, and 9 cell lines to generate measurable residual disease (MRD) frequencies spanning clinically relevant thresholds. Linearity was determined using samples contrived from cell line gDNA spiked into healthy gDNA to generate 11 MRD frequencies for each DNA input, then confirmed using clinical samples. Quantitation accuracy was assessed by (1) comparing clonoSEQ and multiparametric flow cytometry (mpFC) measurements of ALL and MM cell lines diluted in healthy mononuclear cells, and (2) analyzing precision study data for bias between clonoSEQ MRD results in diluted gDNA and those expected from mpFC based on original, undiluted samples. Repeatability of nucleotide base calls was assessed via the assay's ability to recover malignant clonotype sequences across several replicates, process features, and MRD levels. RESULTS: LoD and LoQ were estimated at 1.903 cells and 2.390 malignant cells, respectively. LoB was zero in healthy donor gDNA. Precision ranged from 18% CV (coefficient of variation) at higher DNA inputs to 68% CV near the LoD. Variance component analysis showed MRD results were robust, with expected laboratory process variations contributing </=3% CV. Linearity and accuracy were demonstrated for each disease across orders of magnitude of clonal frequencies. Nucleotide sequence error rates were extremely low. CONCLUSIONS: These studies validate the analytical performance of the clonoSEQ Assay and demonstrate its potential as a highly sensitive diagnostic tool for selected lymphoid malignancies.",,"['Ching,

The only therapies available are hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for bone marrow failure or leukemia, and surgical resection for solid tumors. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for new therapeutic options. With this aim, we developed a novel high-content cell-based screening assay to identify drugs with therapeutic potential in FA. RESULTS: A TALEN-mediated FANCA-deficient U2OS cell line was stably transfected with YFP-FANCD2 fusion protein. These cells were unable to form fluorescent foci or to monoubiquitinate endogenous or exogenous FANCD2 upon DNA damage and were more sensitive to mitomycin C when compared to the parental wild type counterpart. FANCA correction by retroviral infection restored the cell line's ability to form FANCD2 foci and ubiquitinate FANCD2. The feasibility of this cell-based system was interrogated in a high content screening of 3802 compounds, including a Prestwick library of 1200 FDA-approved drugs. The potential hits identified were then individually tested for their ability to rescue FANCD2 foci and monoubiquitination, and chromosomal stability in the absence of FANCA. CONCLUSIONS: While, unfortunately, none of the compounds tested were able to restore cellular FANCA-deficiency, our study shows the potential capacity to screen large compound libraries in the context of Fanconi anemia therapeutics in an optimized and cost-effective platform.",,"['Montanuy, Helena', 'Camps-Fajol, Cristina', 'Carreras-Puigvert, Jordi', 'Haggblad, Maria', 'Lundgren, Bo', 'Aza-Carmona, Miriam', 'Helleday, Thomas', 'Minguillon, Jordi', 'Surralles, Jordi']","['Montanuy H', 'Camps-Fajol C', 'Carreras-Puigvert J', 'Haggblad M', 'Lundgren B', 'Aza-Carmona M', 'Helleday T', 'Minguillon J', 'Surralles J']","['Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Join Research Unit on Genomic Medicine UAB-Sant Pau, Biomedical Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Join Research Unit on Genomic Medicine UAB-Sant Pau, Biomedical Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Molecular Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Currently at Division of Genome Biology, Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Molecular Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, SciLifelab, Stockholm University, Stockholm, SE, Sweden.', 'Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics and Skeletal dysplasia multidisciplinary Unit, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Madrid, Spain.', 'Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Molecular Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades raras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Genetics Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

It is approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and in patients with minimal residual disease after intensive induction chemotherapy. Relapse patterns after treatment with blinatumomab have not been well characterized. METHODS: We reviewed patients treated with blinatumomab with relapsed, refractory or minimal residual disease-positive B-ALL from 1 December 2014 to 31 December 2018 at a single academic medical center. Patient demographics, blast percentage prior to blinatumomab initiation, prior lines of therapy, blinatumomab treatment duration, sites of relapse, progression free survival, and overall survival were collected. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were identified. Four (20%) patients developed extramedullary relapse following blinatumomab. The median time from treatment initiation to extramedullary relapse was 179 days (range 47-241). Sites of extramedullary relapse included the pancreas, adrenal gland, kidneys, liver, parotid gland, and brain. CONCLUSION: Extramedullary relapse occurs frequently following treatment of B-ALL with blinatumomab.

Currently, Cyrabol(R), powder for injection, is one of the specialties marketed in Tunisia. However, no stability data when diluted with 0.9% NaCl are available. The aim of this study is to evaluate the physical and chemical stability of cytarabine (Cyrabol(R)) solution after dilution in 0.9% NaCl (1 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) in polypropylene syringes under different storage conditions. METHODS: Cytarabine solutions (1 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) in 0.9% NaCl were prepared in polypropylene syringes and stored for 28 days under different conditions. Cytarabine preparations in glass containers were prepared as a control to detect any adsorption. Chemical stability was assessed by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. The stability-indicating capacity of the method was proved by forced degradation tests. Linearity, precision and limit of detection and quantification were performed according to the International Conference on Harmonisation recommendations. Physical stability was checked by visual inspection. RESULTS: The method was proven to be a validated stability-indicating assay. At 2-8 degrees C, all tested solutions were chemically stable for 28 days. However, at 25 degrees C, the main degradation product gradually increased during the study and the chemical stability of 1 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL solutions was 14 days, 8 days and 5 days, respectively. Similar results were observed in the glass containers. CONCLUSION: The highest physical and chemical stability of cytarabine diluted in 0.9% NaCl in polypropylene syringes was observed at 2-8 degrees C. At 25 degrees C, better stability was found in the 1 mg/mL solution compared with those at higher concentrations (5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL).",,"['Ayed, Wiem Ben', 'Drira, Chema', 'Soussi, Mohamed Ali', 'Ouesleti, Hanen', 'Hamdene, Besma', 'Khrouf, Myriam', 'Safta, Fathi', 'Fradi, Ines']","['Ayed WB', 'Drira C', 'Soussi MA', 'Ouesleti H', 'Hamdene B', 'Khrouf M', 'Safta F', 'Fradi I']","['National Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'National Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'National Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'National Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'National Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200630,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytarabine', 'polypropylene', 'stability', 'storage']",,2020/07/02 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/02 06:00'],"['2020/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220937405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Jun;27(4):827-833. doi: 10.1177/1078155220937405.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available studies concerning the relationship between plasma fibrinogen level and survival in AML patients. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) were calculated to evaluate the effect. A random-effect model was applied and the robustness of the pooled results was confirmed by subgroup and sensitivity analysis. A total of 9 studies were eligible to assess the association between plasma fibrinogen level and prognosis in AML. Among these investigations above, 5 studies adopted OS as their outcome indicator and were selected for the final meta-analysis. The pooled result suggested that plasma fibrinogen level was significantly relevant to increased mortality risk in AML patients (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44, p = .000, I(2)=85.4%).

Moreover, low-molecular-weight fucoidans are reported to possess more bioactivities than native fucoidans. In the present study, a native fucoidan (SC) was extracted from Sargassum crassifolium pretreated by single-screw extrusion, and three degraded fucoidans, namely, SCA (degradation of SC by ascorbic acid), SCH (degradation of SC by hydrogen peroxide), and SCAH (degradation of SC by ascorbic acid + hydrogen peroxide), were produced. The extrusion pretreatment can increase the extraction yield of fucoidan by approximately 4.2-fold as compared to the non-extruded sample. Among SC, SCA, SCH, and SCAH, the chemical compositions varied but structural features were similar. SC, SCA, SCH, and SCAH showed apoptotic effects on human lung carcinoma A-549 cells, as illustrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) expression, increased cytochrome c release, increased active caspase-9 and -3, and increased late apoptosis of A-549 cells. In general, SCA was found to exhibit high cytotoxicity to A-549 cells and a strong ability to suppress Bcl-2 expression. SCA also showed high efficacy to induce cytochrome c release, activate caspase-9 and -3, and promote late apoptosis of A-549 cells. Therefore, our data suggest that SCA could have an adjuvant therapeutic potential in the treatment of lung cancer.

Zbtb46 has been reported to be a negative indicator of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that Zbtb46 was expressed at a relatively higher level in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) compared to mature cells, and higher in AML cells compared to normal bone marrow (BM) cells. However, the role of Zbtb46 in HSPCs and AML cells remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the effect of Zbtb46 in normal hematopoiesis and AML cells. METHODS: We generated Zbtb46 and Zbtb46Mx1-Cre mice. The deletion of Zbtb46 in Zbtb46Mx1-Cre mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of double-stranded poly (I). poly (C) (poly(I:C)), and referred as Zbtb46 cKO. After confirming the deletion of Zbtb46, the frequency and numbers of HSPCs and mature blood cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serial intraperitoneal injection of 5-fluorouracil was administrated to determine the repopulation ability of HSCs from Zbtb46 and Zbtb46 cKO mice. The correlation between Zbtb46 expression and prognosis was analyzed using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas. To investigate the role of Zbtb46 in AML cells, we knocked down the expression of Zbtb46 in THP-1 cells using lentiviral vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting Zbtb46. Cell proliferation rate was determined by cell count assay. Cell apoptosis and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentages and absolute numbers of HSPCs and mature blood cells were comparable in Zbtb46 cKO mice and its Zbtb46 littermates (Zbtb46vs. Zbtb46 cKO, HPC: 801,310 +/- 84,282 vs. 907,202 +/- 97,403, t = 0.82, P = 0.46; LSK: 86,895 +/- 7802 vs. 102,210 +/- 5025, t = 1.65, P = 0.17; HSC: 19,753 +/- 3116 vs. 17,608 +/- 3508, t = 0.46, P = 0.67). The repopulation ability of HSCs from Zbtb46Mx1-Cre mice was similar to those from Zbtb46 control (P = 0.26). Zbtb46 had elevated expression in AML cells compared to total BM cells from normal control. Knockdown of Zbtb46 in THP-1 cells led to a significant increase in cell apoptosis and reduced cell growth and proliferation. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data indicate that Zbtb46 is essential for survival and proliferation of AML cells, but dispensable for normal hematopoiesis.",,"['Liu, Yuan-Yuan', 'Xiao, Fei-Fei', 'Yang, Bi-Jie', 'Li, Xi', 'Xu, Shuang-Nian', 'Chen, Zhi-Wei', 'Li, Ping', 'Huang, Yong-Xiu', 'Fu, Xue-Mei', 'Huang, Xing-Qin', 'Zheng, Guang-Ling', 'Chen, Jie-Ping', 'Hou, Yu']","['Liu YY', 'Xiao FF', 'Yang BJ', 'Li X', 'Xu SN', 'Chen ZW', 'Li P', 'Huang YX', 'Fu XM', 'Huang XQ', 'Zheng GL', 'Chen JP', 'Hou Y']","['Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', ""Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Prevention and Cure of Metabolic Diseases, College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Radiology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,PMC7401791,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000000878 [doi]', '00029330-202007200-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Jul 20;133(14):1688-1695. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000878.,,14,,20210514,,IM,"['Animals', '*BTB-POZ Domain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Zinc Fingers']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To enhance the efficacy and reduce side effects, an active targeting drug delivery system with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) coated with folic acid (FA) modified PEGylated lipid-bilayer (LB) membrane (FA-LB-MSNs) was established for co-loading drugs. The drug loadings of Ptx and TanIIA in FA-LB-MSNs were 5.5% and 1.8%, respectively. Compared with the uncoated MSNs, the FA-LB-MSNs showed a sustained drug release, and Ptx and TanIIA released synchronously from the carriers. By means of biological adhesion between FA and its receptors, the uptake of FA-LB-MSNs by NB4 cells was significantly higher than that of uncoated preparations, and Ptx combined with TanIIA had strong synergistic effect to enhance the apoptosis and differentiation of NB4 cells. The results of pharmacodynamics in vivo showed that the FA-LB-MSNs targeted tumor in nude mice more effectively than the compared formulations without FA modification. The Ptx and TanIIA-loaded FA-LB-MSNs group showed significantly better effects on inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth than the reference groups, which agreed with the results of anti-tumor experiments in vitro. Furthermore, no toxicity was observed to the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of the tumor-bearing animals, indicating good biocompatibility of the prepared novel nanocarriers. This study confirmed the synergistic therapeutic effect of Ptx and TanIIA on APL, and the superior of FA-LB-MSNs as co-loaded nanocarriers for active targeted therapy of tumors.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Although significant progress has been made integrating FLT3-ITD detection within contemporary next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels, AR estimation is not routinely part of clinical NGS practice because of inherent biases and challenges. In this study, data from multiple NGS platforms-anchored multiplex PCR (AMP), amplicon [TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA)], and hybrid-capture-were analyzed through a custom algorithm, including platform-specific measures of AR. Sensitivity and specificity of NGS for FLT3-ITD status relative to CE were 100% (42/42) and 99.4% (1076/1083), respectively, by AMP on an unselected cohort and 98.1% (53/54) and 100% (48/48), respectively, by TSCA on a selected cohort. Primer analysis identified criteria for ITDs to escape detection by TSCA, estimated to occur in approximately 9% of unselected ITDs. Allelic fractions under AMP or TSCA were highly correlated to CE, with linear regression slopes near 1 for ITDs not duplicating primers, and systematically underestimated for ITDs duplicating a primer. Bias was alleviated in AMP through simple adjustments. This article provides an approach for targeted computational FLT3-ITD analysis for NGS data from multiple platforms; AMP was found capable of near perfect sensitivity and specificity with relatively accurate estimates of ARs.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

Specifically, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, which are not targeted by the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax, are increased in the LN. Because ibrutinib forces CLL cells out of the LN, we hypothesized that ibrutinib may thereby affect expression of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 and sensitize CLL cells to venetoclax. We investigated expression of Bcl-2 family members in patients under ibrutinib or venetoclax treatment, combined with dissecting functional interactions of Bcl-2 family members, in an in vitro model of venetoclax resistance. In the PB, recent LN emigrants had higher Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression than did cells immigrating back to the LN. Under ibrutinib treatment, this distinction collapsed; significantly, the pretreatment profile reappeared in patients who relapsed on ibrutinib. However, in response to venetoclax, Bcl-2 members displayed an early increase, underlining the different modes of action of these 2 drugs. Profiling by BH3 mimetics was performed in CLL cells fully resistant to venetoclax due to CD40-mediated induction of Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1. Several dual or triple combinations of BH3 mimetics were highly synergistic in restoring killing of CLL cells. Lastly, we demonstrated that proapoptotic Bim interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members in a sequential manner: Bcl-2 > Bcl-XL > Mcl-1 > Bfl-1. Combined, the data indicate that Bcl-XL is more important in venetoclax resistance than is Mcl-1 and provide biological rationale for potential synergy between ibrutinib and venetoclax.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Haselager, Marco V', 'Kielbassa, Karoline', 'Ter Burg, Johanna', 'Bax, Danique J C', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Borst, Jannie', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Chiodin, Giorgia', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Dubois, Julie', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Haselager MV', 'Kielbassa K', 'Ter Burg J', 'Bax DJC', 'Fernandes SM', 'Borst J', 'Tam C', 'Forconi F', 'Chiodin G', 'Brown JR', 'Dubois J', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', ""Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and St. Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and."", 'Cancer Sciences and Haematology Department, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)77867-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004326 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Dec 17;136(25):2918-2926. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004326.,,25,,20210406,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adenine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental systems that reveal potential paths to resistance for a given inhibitor and kinase target have an important role in preclinical development of kinase inhibitor drugs. Here, we employed a codon mutagenesis strategy to define the mutational landscape of acquired resistance in HCK, a member of the SRC tyrosine kinase family and therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using PCR-based saturation mutagenesis, we created a cDNA library designed to replace each codon in the HCK open reading frame with all possible codons. This HCK mutant library was used to transform Rat-2 fibroblasts, followed by selection for resistant colonies with A-419259, a pyrrolopyrimidine HCK inhibitor and drug lead for AML. X-ray crystallography has shown that A-419259 binding induces outward rotation of the kinase domain alphaC-helix, a conformation incompatible with phosphotransfer. Remarkably, only a single resistance mutation evolved during A-419259 selection: histidine substitution for threonine at the gatekeeper position in the kinase domain. Deep sequencing confirmed representation of nearly all other missense mutations across the entire HCK open reading frame. This observation suggests that A-419259 and other C-helix-out Src-family kinase inhibitors may have a narrow path to acquired resistance in the context of AML cases where Hck is an oncogenic driver.",,"['Patel, Ravi K', 'Patel, Yash K', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Patel RK', 'Patel YK', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 450 Technology Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 450 Technology Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 450 Technology Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200715,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,PMC8136437,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.0c00373 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2020 Aug 21;15(8):2175-2184. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.0c00373.

At the Nevada Test Site (NTS), the atomic veterans participated in military maneuvers, observed nuclear weapons tests, or provided technical support. At the Pacific Proving Ground (PPG), they served aboard ships or were stationed on islands during or after nuclear weapons tests. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants at seven test series, previously studied with high-quality dosimetry and personnel records, and the first test at TRINITY formed the cohort of 114,270 male military participants traced for vital status from 1945 through 2010. Dose reconstructions were based on Nuclear Test Personnel Review records, Department of Defense. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and Cox and Poisson regression models were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Most atomic veterans were enlisted men, served in the Navy at the PPG, and were born before 1930. Vital status was determined for 96.8% of the veterans; 60% had died. Enlisted men had significantly high all-causes mortality SMR (1.06); officers had significantly low all-causes mortality SMR (0.71). The pattern of risk over time showed a diminution of the 'healthy soldier effect': the all-causes mortality SMR after 50 years of follow-up was 1.00. The healthy soldier effect for all cancers also diminished over time. The all-cancer SMR was significantly high after 50 years (SMR 1.10) primarily from smoking-related cancers, attributed in part to the availability of cigarettes in military rations. The highest SMR was for mesothelioma (SMR 1.56) which was correlated with asbestos exposure in naval ships. Prostate cancer was significantly high (SMR 1.13). Ischemic heart disease was significantly low (SMR 0.84). Estimated mean doses varied by organ were low; e.g., the mean red bone marrow dose was 6 mGy (maximum 108 mGy). Internal cohort dose-response analyses provided no evidence for increasing trends with radiation dose for leukemia (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)) [ERR (95% CI) per 100 mGy -0.37 (-1.08, 0.33); n = 710], CLL, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, ischemic heart disease, or cancers of the lung, prostate, breast, and brain. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant radiation associations were observed among 114,270 nuclear weapons test participants followed for up to 65 years. The 95% confidence limits were narrow and excluded mortality risks per unit dose that are two to four times higher than those reported in other investigations. Significantly elevated SMRs were seen for mesothelioma and asbestosis, attributed to asbestos exposure aboard ships.",,"['Boice, John D', 'Cohen, Sarah S', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Chen, Heidi', 'Golden, Ashley P', 'Beck, Harold L', 'Till, John E']","['Boice JD', 'Cohen SS', 'Mumma MT', 'Chen H', 'Golden AP', 'Beck HL', 'Till JE']","['National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'EpidStrategies, a Division of ToxStrategies, Cary, NC, USA.', 'International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.', 'Private Consultant, New York, NY, USA.', 'Risk Assessment Corporation, Neeses, SC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200803,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,['NOTNLM'],"['Atomic veterans', 'Million Person Study', 'cancer', 'nuclear weapons tests', 'radiation epidemiology', 'suicide']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2020.1787543 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Radiat Biol. 2020 Aug 3:1-22. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2020.1787543.,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8755-1299', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0421-1983', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7506-8710', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9430-7702', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4355-0507', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3666-8806']",,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: BM aspirate and PB samples from 41 CML patients treated with IM and NI were studied by cytogenetic, molecular genetic, and flow cytometry methods. According to the response to TKIs, the patients were distributed into the optimal response, warning, and treatment failure groups. RESULTS: The patients with optimal response to TKI therapy showed the lowest levels of Ki-67 expression in PB and BM compared with the patients from warning and falure treatment groups, however, Ki-67 expression was close to the reference values in PB (0.7 +/- 0.3)%, only in NI-treated patients, The highest expression of Ki-67 in PB was observed in patients from treatment failure groups. In PB of patients who received NI and did not achieve optimal response, CD34(+) cell count increased by almost 4 times compared with that in the optimal response group. The results indicated that CD34(+) cell pool expanded in patients with poor response to both IM and NI. In patients with optimal response to NI therapy, CD34(+) cell counts in PB were within the reference range and did not exceed 0.5%. Similar results were observed for Ki-67 and CD34(+) in BM hematopoietic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ki-67 expression and CD34(+) cell count in PB and BM of CML patients increased with the acquisition of clonal resistance to IM and NI.

RESULTS: A direct interaction between Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and USP1 protein in K562 cells was established by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescence analysis and confocal microscopy revealed that Bcr-Abl/USP1 protein complex is formed in the cell nucleus. The inhibition of USP1 protein activity by ML323 reduced the level of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS: USP1 protein has been identified as a new protein partner of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in chronic myeloid leukemia. The relationship between the functional activity of USP1 protein and the level of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein has been demonstrated, suggesting that the targeted inhibition of USP1 activity could be a challenging approach for reducing Bcr-Abl expression.",,"['Antonenko, S V', 'Telegeev, G D']","['Antonenko SV', 'Telegeev GD']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics NAS of Ukraine, Kyiv 03143, Ukraine.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics NAS of Ukraine, Kyiv 03143, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['14533 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-2.14533 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Jun;42(2):109-114. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-2.14533.,,2,,20210503,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bone marrow cells of one patient with therapy-related acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia and one patient with therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia were examined by cytogenetic GTG banding technique. RESULTS: An unusually large number of quantitative and structural anomalies of chromosomes in therapy-related acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia have been established, which have many features in common with chromothripsis, namely instability of clones that manifested itself through quantitative anomalies (trisomy, monosomy, marker chromosomes, including chromosome 5), structural - t(9;11), deletions of the long arm of chromosomes 8 and 14, derivatives of chromosomes 3 and 7, ring chromosomes. In case of secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the anomalous clone with balanced translocation in all 20 metaphase plates 46,XX,t(1;15)(p21;q24) has been registered, which is not described in the literature. Therefore, the diagnostic and prognostic value of such anomaly is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Rearrangement with the involvement of the locus 11q23 was recorded in the case of chemotherapy treatment without topoisomerase II inhibitors. The complex karyotype formed after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which is a criterion for an unfavorable prognosis of the disease, is considered as the equivalent of chromothripsis. t(1;15) is considered as an abnormality that can be attributed to the group of favorable secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia prognosis.",,"['Andreieva, S V', 'Kyselova, O A', 'Serbin, I M', 'Alkhimova, O G']","['Andreieva SV', 'Kyselova OA', 'Serbin IM', 'Alkhimova OG']","['State Institution ""Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology of NAMS of Ukraine"", Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology of NAMS of Ukraine"", Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', 'City Hospital No 9, Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology & Genetics of NAS of Ukraine, Kyiv 03680, Ukraine.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['14593 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-2.14593 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Jun;42(2):126-129. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-2.14593.,,2,,20210503,,IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, MRD is determined by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) or PCR-based methods detecting leukemia-specific fusion transcripts and mutations. However, while MFC is highly operator-dependent and difficult to standardize, PCR-based methods are only available for a minority of AML patients. Here we describe a novel, highly sensitive and broadly applicable method for MRD detection by combining MFC-based leukemic cell enrichment using an optimized combinatorial antibody panel targeting CLL-1, TIM-3, CD123 and CD117, followed by mutational analysis of recurrently mutated genes in AML. In dilution experiments this method showed a sensitivity of 10(-4) to 10(-5) for residual disease detection. In prospectively collected remission samples this marker combination allowed for a median 67-fold cell enrichment with sufficient DNA quality for mutational analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS) or digital PCR in 39 out of 41 patients. Twenty-one samples (53.8%) tested MRD positive, whereas 18 (46.2%) were negative. With a median follow-up of 559 days, 71.4% of MRD positive (15/21) and 27.8% (5/18) of MRD negative patients relapsed (P = .007). The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher for MRD positive patients (5-year CIR: 90.5% vs 28%, P < .001). In multivariate analysis, MRD positivity was a prominent factor for CIR. Thus, MFC-based leukemic cell enrichment using antibodies against CLL-1, TIM-3, CD123 and CD117 followed by mutational analysis allows high sensitive MRD detection and is informative on relapse risk in the majority of AML patients.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The prognosis in relapsed AML patients is generally poor but depends largely on the timing of relapse (early versus late) and the possibility of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). At the time of relapse, we again perform a mutational screening and cytogenetic analysis in all AML patients as clonal evolution of disease is frequent. Clinical trials should be first priority in all relapsed patients. In fit patients without prior transplant, we aim to perform HSCT after salvage therapy. In AML patients relapsing after HSCT and good performance status, intensive therapy can be considered with subsequent cellular therapy such as donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or a second HSCT. However, less than 20% of these patients are alive after 5 years. For those patients that are unfit, the therapeutic aim is to prolong life with acceptable quality of life. Here, hypomethylating agents (HMA), low-dose AraC (LDAC), and solely cytoreductive therapy with hydroxurea are options depending on first-line therapy. For those patients that have not been treated with venetoclax in first line, the combination therapy of venetoclax with demethylating agents achieves encouraging response rates. Venetoclax is currently also studied in combination with intensive salvage therapy. Importantly, for patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2-mutated AML, ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, and enasidenib, an IDH2 inhibitor, present well-tolerated options in the setting of refractory or relapsed (r/r) disease even in elderly and heavily pre-treated patients with response rates of 30-40%. Both substances have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for r/r AML patients with IDH1/2 mutations (but not yet by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)). For patients with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, treatment with the selective FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib is well tolerated and leads to improved outcome compared with standard salvage therapy. The approval has been granted by the FDA and the EMA. Generally, we would recommend targeted therapy for IDH1/2- and FLT3-mutated AML if available. In order to improve outcome in relapsed AML, it will be important to intelligently combine novel substances with each other as well as chemotherapy in prospective clinical trials. The development of therapies with bispecific antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are still in early development.",,"['Thol, Felicitas', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Thol F', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. ganser.arnold@mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200629,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,PMC7324428,['NOTNLM'],"['*CPX-351', '*FLT3 inhibitors', '*IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors', '*Relapse AML', '*Salavage chemotherapy', '*Venetoclax']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-020-00765-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-020-00765-5 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2020 Jun 29;21(8):66. doi: 10.1007/s11864-020-00765-5.,,8,,20210809,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Standard of Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Niche providing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) regulate the function of VSELs/HSCs by providing crucial paracrine support. Any dysfunction of stem cells and/or their niche leads to disease state. The stem cells biology gets affected with age leading to a myeloid bias in differentiation of HSCs and increased incidence of myeloid leukemia. Present study was undertaken to enumerate VSELs, HSCs and MSCs and evaluate their response on D4 and D10 after chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in young and aged mouse bone marrow. Stem cells were activated in response to 5-FU induced stress in an attempt to restore homeostasis. Although absolute numbers of VSELs and HSCs did not differ much between young and aged mice, their tendency to proliferate was higher on D4 in aged mice. However, ability to revert back to basal numbers and their differentiation was affected on D10 in aged marrow. Stem cells from aged bone marrow showed greater ability to form CFUs on D10 after 5-FU treatment. CD44 positive aged MSCs also showed increased proliferation on D10. Transplanting MSCs from young mice in 5-FU treated aged marrow helped improve hematopoiesis. The results suggest that no significant intrinsic changes occur as proliferative ability of stem cells remains unaffected but the niche gets affected with age leading to excessive self-renewal and compromised differentiation. This may explain increased incidence of leukemia with age.",,"['Ganguly, Ranita', 'Anand, Sandhya', 'Metkari, Siddhanath', 'Bhartiya, Deepa']","['Ganguly R', 'Anand S', 'Metkari S', 'Bhartiya D']","['Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai, 400 012, India.', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai, 400 012, India.', 'Experimental Animal Facility, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai, 400 012, India.', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai, 400 012, India. bhartiyad@nirrh.res.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Differentiation', '*HSCs', '*MSCs', '*Niche', '*Proliferation', '*Stem cells', '*VSELs']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-020-09998-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-020-09998-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2020 Oct;16(5):909-921. doi: 10.1007/s12015-020-09998-1.,,5,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5384-3998'],20210602,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Femur/cytology', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Regeneration/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Telomere/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to compare the prognostic performance of the scores and to arrive at an evidence-based score recommendation. In 2949 patients not involved in any score development, higher hazard ratios and concordance indices in any comparison demonstrated the best discrimination of long-term survival with the ELTS score. In a second step, of 5154 patients analyzed to investigate risk group classification differences, 23% (n = 1197) were allocated to high-risk by the Sokal score.

Concentrations of ficolin-1, ficolin-2, ficolin-3 and MBL (before chemotherapy) in serum were determined as were selected polymorphisms of the corresponding genes (FCN1, FCN2, FCN3 and MBL2). The control group (C) consisted of 267 healthy unrelated individuals. Median level of ficolin-1 in patients was lower (p < 0.000001) while median levels of ficolin-2, ficolin-3 and MBL were higher (p < 0.000001, p < 0.000001 and p = 0.0016, respectively) compared with controls. These findings were generally associated with AML itself, however the highest MBL levels predicted higher risk of severe hospital infections (accompanied with bacteremia and/or fungaemia) (p = 0.012) while the lowest ficolin-1 concentrations tended to be associated with prolonged (> 7 days) fever (p = 0.026). Genotyping indicated an association of G/G homozygosity (corresponding to FCN1 gene - 542 G > A polymorphism) with malignancy [p = 0.004, OR = 2.95, 95% CI (1.41-6.16)].

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care in the treatment of older or unfit patients with AML, but responses are modest and not durable(3-5). Here we demonstrate that LSCs upregulate the tumor necrosis factor family ligand CD70 in response to HMA treatment resulting in increased CD70/CD27 signaling. Blocking CD70/CD27 signaling and targeting CD70-expressing LSCs with cusatuzumab, a human alphaCD70 monoclonal antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, eliminated LSCs in vitro and in xenotransplantation experiments. Based on these preclinical results, we performed a phase 1/2 trial in previously untreated older patients with AML with a single dose of cusatuzumab monotherapy followed by a combination therapy with the HMA azacitidine ( NCT03030612 ). We report results from the phase 1 dose escalation part of the clinical trial. Hematological responses in the 12 patients enrolled included 8 complete remission, 2 complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery and 2 partial remission with 4 patients achieving minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry at <10(-)(3). Median time to response was 3.3 months. Median progression-free survival was not reached yet at the time of the data cutoff. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and the maximum tolerated dose of cusatuzumab was not reached.

Aberrant activation and mutations of Notch signaling components are linked to tumor initiation, maintenance, and resistance to cancer therapy. Several strategies, such as monoclonal antibodies against Notch ligands and receptors, as well as small-molecule gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), have been developed to interfere with Notch receptor activation at proximal points in the pathway. However, the use of drug-like small molecules to target the downstream mediators of Notch signaling, the Notch transcription activation complex, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of an orally active small-molecule inhibitor (termed CB-103) of the Notch transcription activation complex. We show that CB-103 inhibits Notch signaling in primary human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other Notch-dependent human tumor cell lines, and concomitantly induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby impairing proliferation, including in GSI-resistant human tumor cell lines with chromosomal translocations and rearrangements in Notch genes. CB-103 produces Notch loss-of-function phenotypes in flies and mice and inhibits the growth of human breast cancer and leukemia xenografts, notably without causing the dose-limiting intestinal toxicity associated with other Notch inhibitors. Thus, we describe a pharmacological strategy that interferes with Notch signaling by disrupting the Notch transcription complex and shows therapeutic potential for treating Notch-driven cancers.",,"['Lehal, Rajwinder', 'Zaric, Jelena', 'Vigolo, Michele', 'Urech, Charlotte', 'Frismantas, Viktoras', 'Zangger, Nadine', 'Cao, Linlin', 'Berger, Adeline', 'Chicote, Irene', 'Loubery, Sylvain', 'Choi, Sung Hee', 'Koch, Ute', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Palmer, Hector G', 'Bornhauser, Beat', 'Gonzalez-Gaitan, Marcos', 'Arsenijevic, Yvan', 'Zoete, Vincent', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Radtke, Freddy']","['Lehal R', 'Zaric J', 'Vigolo M', 'Urech C', 'Frismantas V', 'Zangger N', 'Cao L', 'Berger A', 'Chicote I', 'Loubery S', 'Choi SH', 'Koch U', 'Blacklow SC', 'Palmer HG', 'Bornhauser B', 'Gonzalez-Gaitan M', 'Arsenijevic Y', 'Zoete V', 'Aster JC', 'Bourquin JP', 'Radtke F']","['Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Research & Development, Cellestia Biotech SA, 4057 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Research & Development, Cellestia Biotech SA, 4057 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Research & Development, Cellestia Biotech SA, 4057 Basel, Switzerland.', ""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Unit of Gene Therapy and Stem Cell Biology, Department of Ophtalmology, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne, 1004 Lausanne, Switzerland.', ""Stem Cells and Cancer Group, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, 08035 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Geneva, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', ""Stem Cells and Cancer Group, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, 08035 Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Geneva, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Unit of Gene Therapy and Stem Cell Biology, Department of Ophtalmology, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne, 1004 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Computer-Aided Molecular Engineering, Department of Oncology, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."", ""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; freddy.radtke@epfl.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200629,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC7368267,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch', '*cancer', '*small-molecule inhbitor']","['Competing interest statement: R.L. and F.R. are cofounders of Cellestia Biotech', 'AG, and R.L., M.V., and C.U. are employees of the company.']",2020/07/01 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['1922606117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1922606117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Jul 14;117(28):16292-16301. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1922606117.

However, BRAF mutations are overall quite rare in hematological malignancies. Studies over the past decade have identified high-frequency BRAF (V600E), MAP2K1, and other kinase alterations in two groups of MAPK-driven hematopoietic neoplasms: hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and the systemic histiocytoses. Despite HCL and histiocytoses sharing common molecular alterations, these are phenotypically distinct malignancies that differ in respect to clinical presentation and suspected cell of origin. The purpose of this review is to highlight the molecular advancements over the last decade in the histiocytic neoplasms and HCL and discuss the impact these insights have had on our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology, cellular origins, and therapy of these enigmatic diseases as well as perspectives for future research directions.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],"['Chakraborty, Rikhia', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Durham, Benjamin H']","['Chakraborty R', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Durham BH']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20210503,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,101571139,PMC7770072,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2022/05/03 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['cshperspect.a034892 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a034892 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2021 May 3;11(5). pii: cshperspect.a034892. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a034892.,"['K08 CA218901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA231804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",5,,20211210,"['EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Erdheim-Chester Disease/genetics/physiopathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Mutation']",,['NIHMS1612691'],,,,,,,,,['2022/05/03 00:00'],,

Incorporating rituximab to standard of care is found to improve the outcome of CD20(+) BCP-ALL. The aim of this study is to estimate the prognostic effect of CD20 expression and the impact of rituximab in BCP-ALL in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 55 Saudi adult patients with BCP-ALL in King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam from 2008 to 2017. RESULTS: The proportion of CD20(+) cases was approximately 55%. Excluding rituximab-treated patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of CD20(+) patients was lower than CD20(-) patients (56% vs. 66%; P = .62). Among CD20(+) patients, the proportion that received rituximab was approximately 27%. Comparing CD20(+) patients with and without rituximab, all patients who received rituximab achieved complete remission (CR) 4 weeks post-induction. The 3-year OS rate (88% vs. 63%; P = .35) and the 2-year event-free survival rate (70% vs. 68%; P = .75) were in favor of rituximab. In univariate and multivariate analyses, CR 4 weeks post-induction is recognized as an independent predictor of outcome. However, differences in survival rates did not have a statistical significance. CONCLUSION: CD20 expression in adult patients with BCP-ALL seems to be higher in Saudi Arabians than in Caucasians, and it seems to have a tendency towards an inferior outcome in terms of OS. Incorporating rituximab to standard of care seems to improve the outcome in terms of CR, OS, and event-free survival.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: A 29-week commercial layer flock positive for avian leukosis virus-J (ALV-J), Marek's disease virus (MDV) and avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) was selected, and fresh fecal samples were collected and examined for the composition of the gut microflora by Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the fecal microbiota differentiated the chickens infected with only ALV-J and those coinfected with ALV-J and MDV or REV from infection-negative chickens. The enrichment and diversity of cloacal microflora in chickens infected with ALV-J alone were slightly different from those in the infection-negative chickens. However, the diversity of cloacal microflora was significantly increased in chickens coinfected with both ALV-J and MDV or REV. CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal microbiota was more strongly disturbed in chickens after coinfection with ALV-J and MDV or REV than after infection with ALV-J alone, and there may be underlying mechanisms by which the capacity for the stabilization of the intestinal flora was impaired due to viral infection and tumorigenesis.",,"['Wan, Xianhua', 'Xu, Laipeng', 'Sun, Xiangli', 'Li, Hui', 'Yan, Fengbin', 'Han, Ruili', 'Li, Hong', 'Li, Zhuanjian', 'Tian, Yadong', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Kang, Xiangtao', 'Wang, Zhenya', 'Wang, Yanbin']","['Wan X', 'Xu L', 'Sun X', 'Li H', 'Yan F', 'Han R', 'Li H', 'Li Z', 'Tian Y', 'Liu X', 'Kang X', 'Wang Z', 'Wang Y']","['College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China.', 'Key Laboratory of ""Runliang"" Antiviral Medicines Research and Development, Institute of Drug Discovery & Development, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China. zhenyawang@zzu.edu.cn.', 'College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 450000, China. ybwang2008@henau.edu.cn.', 'Henan Research Center of Germplasm Resources for Poultry, Zhengzhou, 450002, China. ybwang2008@henau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200629,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,PMC7324990,['NOTNLM'],"['16S rRNA', 'ALV-J', 'Fecal microflora', 'MDV', 'REV']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-020-02430-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-020-02430-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2020 Jun 29;16(1):218. doi: 10.1186/s12917-020-02430-3.,['18A350012/Education Department of Henan Province'],1,,20210219,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/isolation & purification', 'Bacteria/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'Coinfection/*veterinary', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/isolation & purification', 'Marek Disease/virology', 'Poultry Diseases/microbiology/*virology', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/veterinary']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor, represents the first approved agent of this class, and is currently used in CLL and AML. However, monotherapy is rarely sufficient for sustained responses due to the development of drug resistance and loss of dependence upon the targeted protein. Numerous pre-clinical studies have shown that combining venetoclax with other agents may represent a more effective therapeutic strategy by circumventing resistance mechanisms. In this review, we summarize pre-clinical data providing a foundation for rational combination strategies involving venetoclax. AREAS COVERED: Novel combination strategies in hematologic malignancies involving venetoclax, primarily at the pre-clinical level, will be reviewed. We emphasize novel agents that interrupt complementary or compensatory pro-survival pathways, and particularly mechanistic insights underlying synergism. PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google scholar were searched from 2000. EXPERT OPINION: Although venetoclax has proven to be an effective therapeutic in hematologic malignancies, monotherapy may be insufficient for maximal effectiveness due to the development of resistance and/or loss of BCL2 addiction. Further pre-clinical and clinical development of combination therapies may be necessary for optimal outcomes in patients with diverse blood cancers.",,"['Satta, Toshihisa', 'Grant, Steven']","['Satta T', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200716,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,PMC7529910,['NOTNLM'],"['Antiapoptotic pathway', 'BCL2', 'MCL1', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloma', 'venetoclax']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2020.1789588 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2020 Jul;29(7):697-708. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2020.1789588.

METHODS: This study used imputed whole-genome sequencing from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine project to identify novel loci for estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in up to 12 207 Hispanics/Latinos. Replication was performed in the Women's Health Initiative and the UK Biobank when variants were available. RESULTS: Two low-frequency intronic variants were associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (rs58720902 at AQR, minor allele frequency=0.01, P=1.6x10(-8)) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (rs527493184 at ZBTB16, minor allele frequency=0.002, P=1.1x10(-8)). An additional variant at PRNT (rs2422935, minor allele frequency=0.54, P=2.89x10(-8)) was significantly associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate in meta-analysis with replication samples. We also identified 2 known loci for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (BCL2L11 rs116907128, P=5.6x10(-8) and HBB rs344, P=9.3x10(-11)) and validated 8 loci for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio previously identified in the UK Biobank. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows gains in gene discovery when using dense imputation from multi-ethnic whole-genome sequencing data in admixed Hispanics/Latinos. It also highlights limitations in genetic research of kidney traits, including the lack of suitable replication samples for variants that are more common in non-European ancestry and those at low frequency in populations.",,"['Qian, Huijun', 'Kowalski, Madeline H', 'Kramer, Holly J', 'Tao, Ran', 'Lash, James P', 'Stilp, Adrienne M', 'Cai, Jianwen', 'Li, Yun', 'Franceschini, Nora']","['Qian H', 'Kowalski MH', 'Kramer HJ', 'Tao R', 'Lash JP', 'Stilp AM', 'Cai J', 'Li Y', 'Franceschini N']","['Department of Statistics and Operations Research (H.Q., M.H.K.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.', 'Department of Statistics and Operations Research (H.Q., M.H.K.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.', 'Departments of Biostatistics (J.C.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.', 'Department of Biostatistics (R.T.), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Vanderbilt Genetics Institute (R.T.), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL (J.P.L.).', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle (A.M.S.).', 'Departments of Biostatistics (J.C.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.', 'Department of Genetics (Y.L.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.', 'Department of Epidemiology (N.F.), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200629,United States,Circ Genom Precis Med,Circulation.

Exosomes derived from different types of AML cells contain respective combinations of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers that may be used to guide the molecular typing of AML in the clinic. Here, aiming to build more precise molecular typing of AML, we demonstrate multiplex immuno-PCR (mI-PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of multiple surface CDs on exosomes of AML via capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF). This method comprises of four steps: (1) chemical attachment of reporter DNA sequence to the specific detection antibodies, (2) binding of the detection antibodies to their targets on the exosomes, (3) DNA amplification of the reporter DNA, and (4) capillary electrophoresis analysis of the PCR products. With the method, we first realized simultaneous detection of five target CD molecules (CD9, CD34, c-Kit/CD117, CD123, and FLT-3/CD135) on leukemia cell-derived exosomes with high detection sensitivity. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) are 2.41 +/- 0.04 particles/muL and 8.02 +/- 0.16 particles/muL, respectively, for leukemia cell-derived exosomes. This mI-PCR is found sensitive enough to detect picogram (10(-12)) levels of protein concentrations with high recovery (95%) in spiked serum sample experiments. We thus anticipate that the proposed method is promising in sensitive detection of multitargets to assist in the precise molecular typing of many complex diseases.",,"['Singh, Netrapal', 'Huang, Lin', 'Wang, Dian-Bing', 'Shao, Nan', 'Zhang, Xian-En']","['Singh N', 'Huang L', 'Wang DB', 'Shao N', 'Zhang XE']","['Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, P.

Evidence from studies demonstrates benefits of reduced relapse rates, MRI disease activity and disability progression in patients treated with MTX. While effective, MTX use has been limited due to potential adverse effects (AE) ranging from mild to potentially life-threatening AEs such as cardiotoxicity, bone marrow suppression and hematological malignancies. In this study we aimed to review the long-term clinical efficacy, tolerability, and AE profile of treatment with MTX in patients both with relapsing-remitting and rapidly progressive MS over a 10-year follow-up period. METHODS: We collected prospective data of 70 patients with relapsing-remitting and rapidly progressive MS treated with MTX and followed-up over a 10-year period. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores and annualized relapse rates (ARR) were assessed 1 year prior to MTX treatment, and at different time points (1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years) during follow-up. We recorded the time to first relapse and 0.5-point EDSS increase to assess efficacy. We also obtained frequency data on AEs and patients withdrawn from treatment. RESULTS: 70 patients were started on treatment with MTX with 53 patients (34 relapsing-remitting MS, 19 progressive disease) completing the course. Mean EDSS progressed from 5.5 to 6.5 in the relapsing-remitting group and 6.7 to 9.0 in the progressive group over the study period. ARR in the RRMS group reduced at all time points from 2.2 prior to MTX to 0.3 by year 10. We reported 3 significant AEs, one chicken pox and subsequent acute promyelocytic leukemia, one left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one pancytopenia. The commonest AE reported was nausea/vomiting in 28 (40%) patients. Seventeen patients (5 relapsing-remitting, 12 progressive disease) stopped treatment. In fifteen (87%) of these this was due to lack of efficacy. In the remaining 2 patients, MTX was stopped due to one patient developing chicken pox and the other developing first-degree heart block. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that MTX is an effective disease modifying treatment for relapsing-remitting MS with a well-established risk profile. While MTX is now used less frequently, many MS and neurology services continue to follow-up patients who have been treated with MTX previously. Therefore, understanding the long-term effects risks and benefits remains relevant in this patient group. MTX is also a low-cost treatment in comparison to other high efficacy MS disease-modifying treatments and this may be beneficial in low resource settings.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, prognostic prediction and targeted therapies might contribute to better chemotherapeutic response. However, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) markedly impedes chemotherapeutic efficacy and dictates poor prognosis. Therefore, prior evaluation of chemoresistance is of great importance in therapeutic decision making and prognosis. In recent years, preclinical studies on chemoresistance have unveiled a compendium of underlying molecular basis, which facilitated the development of targetable small molecules. Furthermore, routing genomic sequencing has identified various genomic aberrations driving cellular response during the course of therapeutic treatment through adaptive mechanisms of drug resistance, some of which serve as prognostic biomarkers in risk stratification. However, the underlying mechanisms of MDR have challenged the certainty of the prognostic significance of some mutations. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of MDR in therapeutic decision making and prognostic prediction in AML. We present an updated genetic landscape of the predominant mechanisms of drug resistance with novel targeted therapies and potential prognostic biomarkers from preclinical and clinical chemoresistance studies in AML. We particularly highlight the unfolded protein response (UPR) that has emerged as a critical regulatory pathway in chemoresistance of AML with promising therapeutic horizon. Futhermore, we outline the most prevalent mutations associated with mechanisms of chemoresistance and delineate the future directions to improve the current prognostic tools. The molecular analysis of chemoresistance integrated with genetic profiling will facilitate decision making towards personalized prognostic prediction and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The coordination of the expression of RORalpha by driving its transcription would provide better aspects for managing liver homeostasis. MAIN METHODS: The transcriptional expression of RORalpha was measured after treatment of RORalpha agonists on primary hepatocytes and liver. The histone status of Rora gene bodies was examined by analyzing ChIP-seq database. To elucidate molecular mechanism for RORalpha autoregulation, broad ChIP assays for promoters and enhancers with histone and RORalpha antibodies were performed. KEY FINDINGS: We report that natural and synthetic RORalpha agonists, cholesterol sulfate and JC1-40, respectively, increased the transcriptional expression of RORalpha in primary hepatocytes. An analysis of histone status around the Rora gene body identified promoter and enhancer regions of RORalpha. We found that RORalpha indirectly increased histone acetylation of H3K9 at the promoter region and directly enhanced histone monomethylation of H3K4 by binding to enhancer regions. Interestingly, disturbance of mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4), a histone methyltransferase for enhancers, abolished the JC1-40-induced activation of RORalpha via a decrease in H3K4me1. Finally, we observed that the MLL4-mediated autoregulation of RORalpha also occurred in human liver cancer cell lines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with hematological malignancies and candidemia. The diagnosis of candidemia was established according to the single isolation of Candida spp. from blood culture and the presence of symptoms of infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Over 12 years (2006-2017), candidemia was diagnosed in 75 patients aged 17 to 77 years (median 48 years). The causative agents of candidemia were C. albicans in 34.7% of patients, C. non - albicans - in 65.3%. Candidemia caused by C. albicans prevailed in patients of the older age group (median 56.5 years, p=0.04) and in patients with lymphoma (61.5%, p=0.01) with colonization of the gut by the same species of Candida (88.5%, p=0.002). Isolation of C. non - albicans from blood culture was more common in patients with acute leukemia (51%, p=0.01) and in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (22.5%, p=0.01). The ability to form biofilms was observed more frequently among C. non - albicans (59.2%) than C. albicans (19.2%, p=0.001). The clinical symptoms of candidemia were non - specific (fever was in 97%). Septic shock developed in 25 (33%) patients with comparable frequency in both groups. Concomitant infections was also comparable (73% vs. 73.5%). Overall 30-day survival in patients with candidemia caused by C. albicans and C. non - albicans was 61.2% and 61.5%. Treatment with echinocandin was associated with increase of survival compared to other antifungal agents among patients with C. albicans candidaemia (88.9% versus 40%, p=0.02) and among C. non - albicans (77.3% versus 47.8%). CONCLUSION: C. non - albicans constituted a high proportion among causative agents of candidemia. High mortality rate was observed in both groups.

The cooperative work resulted in balanced clinical recommendations and protocols, reproducible in regional hospitals. Though till now there is a big difference in the long term outcome in acute leukemias patients treated in coordinating or regional centers mostly due to much higher early death rate: 7.5-9.5% vs 18-25%. This parameter should be used as criteria of the total efficacy of hematological service in each region of Russia. It became possible within the last years to integrate the minimal residual disease monitoring into clinical trials thus providing a clue parameter for choosing the further therapy - allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Quizartinib was given as a single dose or multiple once-daily doses of 20, 30, 60, or 90 mg. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed using observed concentrations of quizartinib and AC886. Strong CYP3A inhibitor use resulted in an 82% increase in the area under the curve (AUC) and a 72% increase in the maximum concentration (Cmax ) of quizartinib. Albumin level, age, and body surface area were statistically significant covariates on quizartinib PK. However, their individual effects on quizartinib AUC and Cmax were <20%. For AC886, strong CYP3A inhibitor use, body surface area and black/African American race were significant covariates. Except for strong CYP3A inhibitor use, the effects on the overall exposure (AUC of quizartinib + AC886) were <20%.

In this study, the authors investigated the role of circular RNA 0080145 (circ_0080145) in imatinib (IM) resistance of CML. Materials and Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to measure the expression of circ_0080145, microRNA-326 (miR-326), and PTPRF interacting protein alpha 1 (PPFIA1) mRNA. 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of IM and cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was utilized to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of glucose uptake and lactate production were examined using specific kits. Protein levels were detected through western blot assay. The targeting relationship between miR-326 and circ_0080145 or PPFIA1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The murine xenograft model was constructed to investigate the effect of circ_0080145 in vivo. Results: circ_0080145 was upregulated in IM-resistant CML patients and cells. circ_0080145 silencing suppressed IM resistance, cell growth, and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in IM-resistant CML cells in vitro. Moreover, circ_0080145 knockdown blocked tumor growth and IM resistance in vivo. miR-326 was a target of circ_0080145, and miR-326 inhibition restored the effects of circ_0080145 silencing on cell progression and IM resistance. In addition, PPFIA1 was a target gene of miR-326. The suppressive roles in IM resistance, cell growth and glycolysis, and the promotional role in apoptosis mediated by miR-326 were abolished by PPFIA1 overexpression in IM-resistant CML cells. Conclusion: circ_0080145 contributes to IM resistance via modulating miR-326/PPFIA1 axis, which might provide a novel avenue for CML therapy.",,"['Che, Hong', 'Ding, Hong', 'Jia, Xizhen']","['Che H', 'Ding H', 'Jia X']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated to Qingdao University Yuhuangding Hospital of Yantai, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated to Qingdao University Yuhuangding Hospital of Yantai, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Operation Room, Affiliated to Qingdao University Yuhuangding Hospital of Yantai, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200627,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'IM', 'PPFIA1', 'circ_0080145', 'miR-326', 'resistance']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2020/06/30 06:00'],"['2020/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2020.3600 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2020 Jun 27. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2020.3600.,,,,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating investigations have identified the high incidence of DNMT3A mutation in AML, and it is correlated with poor prognosis. Although a few studies have shown the expression of DNMTs and their clinical significance in AML, the results remain to be discussed. Herein, we systemically analyzed the DNMTs expression and their relationship with clinic-pathological features and prognosis in AML patients. DNMTs expression especially for DNMT3A/3B was closely associated with AML among various human cancers. DNMT3A expression was increased in AML patients, whereas DNMT3B expression was decreased. Significant associations between DNMT3A/B expression and clinic-pathological features/gene mutations were observed. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that DNMT3A expression was associated with better overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) among whole-cohort AML, and independently affected OS determined by Cox repression multivariate analysis. Notably, patients that received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) showed significantly better OS and LFS in DNMT3A lower-expressed groups, whereas patients in DNMT3A higher-expressed groups did not.

Herein, we performed a comprehensive assessment using pooled analysis, FPRP (false-positive report probability), TSA (trial sequential analysis), and eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) analysis. Eighteen high-quality articles from China were enrolled. The pooled analysis of rs2295080 with 9502 cases and 10,965 controls showed a decreased risk of urinary system tumors and specific prostate cancers [TG vs. TT, TG+GG vs. TT and G vs. T; P<0.05, OR (odds ratio) <1]. FPRP and TSA data further confirmed these results. There was an increased risk of leukemia [G vs. T, GG vs. TT, and GG vs. TT+TG genotypes; P<0.05, OR>1]. The eQTL data showed a potential correlation between the rs2295080 and mTOR expression in whole blood samples. Nevertheless, FPRP and TSA data suggested that more evidence is required to confirm the potential role of rs2295080 in leukemia risk. The pooled analysis of rs2536 (6653 cases and 7025 controls) showed a significant association in the subgroup of ""population-based"" control source via the allele, heterozygote, dominant, and carrier comparisons (P<0.05, OR>1). In conclusion, the TG genotype of mTOR rs2295080 may be linked to reduced susceptibility to urinary system tumors or specific prostate cancers in Chinese patients. The currently data do not strongly support a role of rs2295080 in leukemia susceptibility.

METHODS: Cytological and immunohistological features, HTLV-1 proviral DNA integration, and rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Cbeta1 gene were examined in 11 HTLV-1(+) patients with HL-like disease. RESULTS: Six patients were classified as HTLV-1(+) HL and five as HL-like ATLL in accordance with genetic findings of HTLV-1 proviral DNA integration and rearrangements of the TCR Cbeta1 gene. Small ordinary looking lymphocytes with round nuclei were detected in the background of six patients with HTLV-1(+) HL, which were immunohistochemically negative for CD25 and CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 and had a low MIB1 labeling index (mean: 28.3%). In the HL-like ATLL specimens, small- and medium-sized atypical lymphocytes with indented and irregular-shaped nuclei were found, and were diffusely positive for CD25 and CCR4, with high MIB1 labeling (mean: 76%). Both groups had scattered CD30(+) and CD15(+) Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (RS) giant cells, with or without CD20 expression and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The 50% overall survival period was significantly longer for the HTLV-1(+) HL group (180 months) than for the HL-like ATLL group (7.8 months; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1(+) HL showed typical small lymphoid cells with a low MIB1 labeling index in a background of Hodgkin and RS cells, with some scattered CD25(+) and CCR4(+) lymphocytes. In HTLV-1 endemic areas, distinguishing HTLV-1(+) HL from HL-like ATLL is important because of their differing treatment strategies and prognoses.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: Explorative semi-structured individual interviews (n = 28) were carried out in patients with acute leukaemia (n = 15) and their patient ambassadors (n = 13). Interpretive description was the methodological framework used for the thematic analysis of the qualitative interview data. RESULTS: Identified themes were as follows: (a) exchanging life experiences (subthemes: individualised support and a meaningful return); (b) existential cohesion; (c) interreflection; and (d) terms and conditions (subtheme: break in journey). Patients experienced a feeling of being understood, the cohesion leading to hope and a feeling of being able to cope with their situation. Patient ambassadors experienced a sense of meaningfulness and gratitude for life. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and patient ambassadors experienced benefits from the individualised support. Their shared experiences created a connection and mutual mirroring, which led to a sense of hope and gratitude for life. Initiatives that introduce peer-to-peer support in newly diagnosed patients with acute leukaemia as part of treatment and in daily clinical practice are crucial. Future studies should further examine the feasibility of peer-to-peer support interventions along the trajectory of acute leukaemia.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

To a certain extent, a good segmentation method for identifying leukocytes from their background is the first step to the efficient functioning of the leukocytes classification system. However, the morphological structure of leukocytes, poor contrast, and the variations in their shape and size lead to the degradation of the segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new leukocyte segmentation framework that first locates and then segments leukocytes from peripheral blood images. Here, the locations of the leukocytes are first identified using a novel edge strength cue (ESc), and later, the Grabcut model is deployed to obtain the segmentation of the leukocytes. The novelty lies in the way the location of the leukocytes is detected, and this improves the leukocyte segmentation accuracy. The experimental evaluation is performed on ALL-IDB1, Cellavision, and LISC datasets for leukocyte segmentation based on the detection of the ESc location. Experimental results are evaluated using precision, recall, and F-score measures. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, the computation time of the proposed method is analyzed and presented in the study.

SphK1 has received attention because of its involvement in varying types of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and neurodegenerative disorders. In the malignancies of breast, lung, uterus, ovary, kidney, and leukemia, overexpression of SphK1 has been reported and thus considered as a potential drug target. In this study, we have performed virtual high-throughput screening of approximately 90,000 natural products from the ZINC database to find potential SphK1-inhibitors. Initially, the hits were selected by applying absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties, Lipinski's rule, and PAINS filters. Further, docking analysis was performed to estimate the binding affinities and specificity to find safe and effective preclinical leads against SphK1. Two compounds, ZINC05434006 and ZINC04260971, bearing appreciable binding affinity and SphK1 selectivity were selected for 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under explicit water conditions. The all-atom MD simulation results suggested that the ZINC05434006 and ZINC04260971 binding induces a slight structural change and stabilizes the SphK1 structure. In conclusion, we propose natural compounds, ZINC05434006 and ZINC04260971, as potential inhibitors of SphK1, which may be further exploited as potential leads to develop effective therapeutics against SphK1-associated diseases including cancer after in vitro and in vivo validations.",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Chemical Society.'],"['Jairajpuri, Deeba Shamim', 'Mohammad, Taj', 'Adhikari, Kirtika', 'Gupta, Preeti', 'Hasan, Gulam Mustafa', 'Alajmi, Mohamed F', 'Rehman, Md Tabish', 'Hussain, Afzal', 'Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz']","['Jairajpuri DS', 'Mohammad T', 'Adhikari K', 'Gupta P', 'Hasan GM', 'Alajmi MF', 'Rehman MT', 'Hussain A', 'Hassan MI']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Arabian Gulf University, P.O.

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE(R), ScienceDirect, and Scopus for English-language articles about case series and case reports for the period 2000-2020 with the terms ""chronic myeloid leukemia"" and ""thrombocytosis"" and pooled them with a case from our institution. Cases were also incorporated from the reference list and screened for inclusion. A total of 20 cases were included in the final cohort. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.86. The mean age of the patients at the time of initial diagnosis was 40.5 years (range: 9-77 years). Out of 17 cases with available data, seven (41%) were asymptomatic and found to have thrombocytosis incidentally upon routine blood work. Five cases (29.4%) either had a history of thrombotic events or presented with severe thrombotic complications, including ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism (PE), and/or miscarriages. Four cases (23.5%) had more than one symptom at presentation, including headache, syncope, and bruising. The average platelet count was 1,923 x 10(9)/L (range: 584-8,688 x 10(9)/L), and one case (5%) had anemia. The bone marrow (BM) examination showed normal cellularity and normal myeloid to erythroid (M/E) ratio in seven (50%) and 11 (84.6%) out of the 14 and 13 cases with reported data, respectively. Moreover, megakaryocytes in the BM were small in 10 cases (71.4%), pleomorphic in three cases (21.4%), and dysplastic in one case (7.1%). Accurate differentiation among MPD subtypes and the exclusion of CML is critical in reaching a proper diagnosis to decide on proper therapy and eventually modify outcomes. Prompt evaluation for the precise diagnosis of patients presenting with isolated marked thrombocytosis will help expedite their diagnosis and initiation of a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, thereby promptly inducing remission, preventing thrombotic complications, and avoiding adverse drug events, which would eventually improve outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Findakly et al.']","['Findakly, Dawood', 'Arslan, Waqas']","['Findakly D', 'Arslan W']","['Internal Medicine, Creighton University Arizona Health Education Alliance/Valleywise Health Medical Center, Phoenix, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Creighton University Arizona Health Education Alliance/Valleywise Health Medical Center, Phoenix, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Creighton University Maricopa Medical Center, Phoenix, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200623,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC7314366,['NOTNLM'],"['bcr-abl positive', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'isolated thrombocytosis', 'systematic review']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/07/01 06:00,2020/07/01 06:01,['2020/06/30 06:00'],"['2020/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8788 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jun 23;12(6):e8788. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8788.,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate IgG avidity and the changes of anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) in patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma. Methods: Ninety eight patients with Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma, selected from patients referring to Imam Reza Hospital of Tabriz (38 degrees 04'N 46 degrees 18'E), in terms of the presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgM, IgG, IgG avidity antibodies and the major risk factors were evaluated. Results: The results of pre-chemotherapy evaluation showed that of the examined patients, only two cases, one patient with ALL and another patient with lymphoma, had a positive IgM titer. Overall, 46 cases had positive IgG titers, including 20 patients with AML, 15 patients with ALL and 11 patients with lymphoma. Three (3.06%) patients were positive for anti-T. gondii IgM and one of them was with new infection of toxoplasmosis in lymphoma patients. The post-chemotherapy IgG titer evaluation showed 46 [46.9% (95% CI 37.4-56.7)] positive IgG cases that this result was similar to the result of pre-treatment phase. One [1% (95% CI 0.2-5.6)] positive IgG avidity case was detected using ELISA method, in a patient with lymphoma whose IgM was also positive. There was no significant difference between the type of leukemia and the history of contact with cat. Conclusion: Performing specialized tests to diagnose toxoplasma infection before starting treatment, in immunodeficiency patients who undergo chemotherapy, is necessary; therefore, these tests should be considered in therapeutic protocols.","['Copyright(c) Iranian Society of Parasitology & Tehran University of Medical', 'Sciences.']","['Tabatabaie, Fatemeh', 'Elmi, Taher', 'Khanmohammadi, Majid', 'Akhlaghi, Lame', 'Mahami-Oskouei, Mahmoud', 'Arshadi, Mehdi']","['Tabatabaie F', 'Elmi T', 'Khanmohammadi M', 'Akhlaghi L', 'Mahami-Oskouei M', 'Arshadi M']","['Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Marand Branch, Islamic Azad University, Marand, Iran.', 'Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Al-Zahra Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Parasitol,Iranian journal of parasitology,101464309,PMC7311818,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Toxoplasma gondii']",['Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.'],2020/07/01 06:00,2020/07/01 06:01,['2020/06/30 06:00'],"['2020/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:01 [medline]']",['ijpa-15-187 [pii]'],ppublish,Iran J Parasitol. 2020 Apr-Jun;15(2):187-195.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the etiology of ALL has not been fully unveiled, initiation of ALL has been demonstrated to partly depend on genetic factors. As indicated by several genome wide association studies (GWASs) and candidate gene analyses, ARID5B, a member of AT-rich interactive domain (ARID) protein family, is associated with the occurrence and prognosis of ALL. However, the mechanisms by which ARID5B genotype impact on the susceptibility and treatment outcome remain vague. In this review, we outline developments in the understanding of ARID5B in the susceptibility of ALL and its therapeutic perspectives, and summarize the underlying mechanisms based on the limited functional studies, hoping to illustrate the possible mechanisms of ARID5B impact and highlight the potential treatment regimens.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Deng, Yan, Zhu, Yin, Shu, Bai, Zhang, Xu and Lu.']","['Wang, Peiqi', 'Deng, Yun', 'Yan, Xinyu', 'Zhu, Jianhui', 'Yin, Yuanyuan', 'Shu, Yang', 'Bai, Ding', 'Zhang, Shouyue', 'Xu, Heng', 'Lu, Xiaoxi']","['Wang P', 'Deng Y', 'Yan X', 'Zhu J', 'Yin Y', 'Shu Y', 'Bai D', 'Zhang S', 'Xu H', 'Lu X']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine/Research Center of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Precision Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Precision Medicine, Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200612,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7303299,['NOTNLM'],"['ARID5B', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'susceptibility']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2020/07/01 06:01,['2020/06/30 06:00'],"['2020/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.00598 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Jun 12;11:598. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00598. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyzing data of 2087 t-MDS patients from different international MDS groups to evaluate classification and prognostication tools we found that applying the WHO classification for p-MDS successfully predicts time to transformation and survival (both p < 0.001). The results regarding carefully reviewed cytogenetic data, classifications, and prognostic scores confirmed that t-MDS are similarly heterogeneous as p-MDS and therefore deserve the same careful differentiation regarding risk. As reference, these results were compared with 4593 primary MDS (p-MDS) patients represented in the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS database (IWG-PM). Although a less favorable clinical outcome occurred in each t-MDS subset compared with p-MDS subgroups, FAB and WHO-classification, IPSS-R, and WPSS-R separated t-MDS patients into differing risk groups effectively, indicating that all established risk factors for p-MDS maintained relevance in t-MDS, with cytogenetic features having enhanced predictive power. These data strongly argue to classify t-MDS as a separate entity distinct from other WHO-classified t-myeloid neoplasms, which would enhance treatment decisions and facilitate the inclusion of t-MDS patients into clinical studies.",,"['Kuendgen, A', 'Nomdedeu, M', 'Tuechler, H', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Komrokji, R S', 'Sekeres, M A', 'Della Porta, M G', 'Cazzola, M', 'DeZern, A E', 'Roboz, G J', 'Steensma, D P', 'Van de Loosdrecht, A A', 'Schlenk, R F', 'Grau, J', 'Calvo, X', 'Blum, S', 'Pereira, A', 'Valent, P', 'Costa, D', 'Giagounidis, A', 'Xicoy, B', 'Dohner, H', 'Platzbecker, U', 'Pedro, C', 'Lubbert, M', 'Oiartzabal, I', 'Diez-Campelo, M', 'Cedena, M T', 'Machherndl-Spandl, S', 'Lopez-Pavia, M', 'Baldus, C D', 'Martinez-de-Sola, M', 'Stauder, R', 'Merchan, B', 'List, A', 'Ganster, C', 'Schroeder, T', 'Voso, M T', 'Pfeilstocker, M', 'Sill, H', 'Hildebrandt, B', 'Esteve, J', 'Nomdedeu, B', 'Cobo, F', 'Haas, R', 'Sole, F', 'Germing, U', 'Greenberg, P L', 'Haase, D', 'Sanz, G']","['Kuendgen A', 'Nomdedeu M', 'Tuechler H', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Komrokji RS', 'Sekeres MA', 'Della Porta MG', 'Cazzola M', 'DeZern AE', 'Roboz GJ', 'Steensma DP', 'Van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Schlenk RF', 'Grau J', 'Calvo X', 'Blum S', 'Pereira A', 'Valent P', 'Costa D', 'Giagounidis A', 'Xicoy B', 'Dohner H', 'Platzbecker U', 'Pedro C', 'Lubbert M', 'Oiartzabal I', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Cedena MT', 'Machherndl-Spandl S', 'Lopez-Pavia M', 'Baldus CD', 'Martinez-de-Sola M', 'Stauder R', 'Merchan B', 'List A', 'Ganster C', 'Schroeder T', 'Voso MT', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Sill H', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Esteve J', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Cobo F', 'Haas R', 'Sole F', 'Germing U', 'Greenberg PL', 'Haase D', 'Sanz G']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany. kuendgen@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.', ""Department of Laboratory Hematology, Institut Catala d'Oncologia Hospital GermansTrias I Pujol, Badalona, Spain."", 'Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Cancer Center - IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital & Humanitas University, Rozzano - Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine and The New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'National Center of Tumor Diseases-Trial Center, National Center of Tumor Diseases, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Laboratory Hematology, Institut Catala d'Oncologia Hospital GermansTrias I Pujol, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hematological Citology Laboratory, Pathology Department, Hospital del Mar, GRETNHE, IMIM Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Service of Hematology, University Hospital Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Hemotherapy and Hemostasis Department, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Hematopathology Section, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Palliative Care, Marienhospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain."", 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Araba, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca (HUSA), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', '1st.

METHODS: Peptide-loaded dendritic cell (DC) prime and non-infectious peptide booster heterologous immunisations were assessed for the immunogenicity of polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1)-derived peptides. Heterologous vaccination regimen targeting multiple shared tumour antigens simultaneously with PD-L1 blockade was assessed against murine myeloid leukaemia. RESULTS: A synthetic PLK1122 (DSDFVFVVL)-based heterologous vaccination generated large numbers of long-lasting antigen-specific CD8 T-cells eliciting therapeutic effects against various established tumours. The therapeutic efficacy of single antigen-targeting PLK1122-based vaccine with sufficient endurance of PD-L1 blockade toward C1498 leukaemia relied on the heterogeneous clonal levels of MHC-I and PD-L1 expression. A novel multi-peptide-based vaccination targeting PLK1 and survivin simultaneously along with PD1 blockade led to complete tumour eradication and long-term survival in mice with clonally heterologous C1498 myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PLK1 could be an attractive immunotherapeutic target antigen for cancer immunotherapy, and that similar strategies would be applicable for the optimisation of cancer vaccines for the treatment of numerous viral diseases and malignant tumours.",,"['Shin, A-Ri', 'Lee, Sang-Eun', 'Choi, Haeyoun', 'Sohn, Hyun-Jung', 'Cho, Hyun-Il', 'Kim, Tai-Gyu']","['Shin AR', 'Lee SE', 'Choi H', 'Sohn HJ', 'Cho HI', 'Kim TG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, South Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, South Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, South Korea.', 'Translational and Clinical Division, ViGenCell Inc., Seoul, 06591, South Korea.', 'Translational and Clinical Division, ViGenCell Inc., Seoul, 06591, South Korea. chohil@vigencell.com.', 'Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Bank, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, South Korea. chohil@vigencell.com.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, South Korea. kimtg@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Bank, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, South Korea. kimtg@catholic.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200629,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC7492404,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/06/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0955-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0955-y [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 Sep;123(6):919-931. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0955-y.

Angiotensin II has been recently approved for use in septic shock due to promising results in the ATHOS-3 trial. However, patients with neutropenia were excluded in the trial. This patient population is becoming increasingly common in the intensive care unit as there is an increase in novel biologic therapies and stem cell transplantations for haematological and solid organ malignancies. We present a case of a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who received chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia and septic shock. There was persistent hypotension despite initiating multiple conventional vasopressors. Angiotensin II was attempted with immediate improvement in the blood pressure which resulted in weaning of other vasopressors.

PTX-induced apoptosis is associated with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/ SAPK) pathways. Transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) play an important role in cell apoptosis through the p38, ERK, NF-kappaB and JNK signal transduction pathways. To investigate the role of TAK1 in PTX-induced cell apoptosis, we treated HEK293 and 8305C cells with 0-20 microM PTX for 6, 12 or 24 h. To investigate whether TAK1 can cooperate with PTX for cancer treatment, we transfected cells with TAK1, TAB1 or control plasmid and treated them with PTX (3-10 microM) for 9-24 h. Apoptosis rates were analysed by flow cytometry (Annexin V/PI). Endogenous TAK1 and TAB1, caspase-7 cleavage, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, Bcl-xL level, phospho-p44/42, phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 were detected by western blot. We show that in HEK293 and 8305C cells, PTX enhanced the endogenous TAK1/TAB1 level and induced cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Upon TAK1 overexpression in HEK293 cells treated with PTX, apoptosis rate, JNK phosphorylation and PARP cleavage increased contrary to heat-shocked or untreated cells. CRISPR editing of the tak1 gene upon PTX treatment resulted in lower phospho-JNK and PARP cleavage levels than in cells transfected with the control or the TAK1- or TAB1 + TAK1-containing plasmids. TAK1-K63A could not induce JNK phosphorylation or PARP cleavage. We conclude that PTX induces HEK293 and 8305C cell apoptosis through the TAK1-JNK activation pathway, potentially highlighting TAK1's role in chemosensitivity.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

It is divergent and encodes either full-length or deleted allele variants. The studies of donor killer KIR2DS4 in unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations were limited. METHODS: KIR and HLA genotyping were determined in 75 pairs of Chinese pediatric hematologic malignancy patients. RESULTS: Among the 75 donor-recipient pairs, 77.3% (58/75) of the donors were positive for full-length KIR2DS4 and 22.7% (17/75) were negative. Patients who had donors positive for full-length KIR2DS4 had higher cumulative incidence of aGVHD than patients whose donor negative for full-length KIR2DS4 (86.2% versus 76.5%, P = .038). Multivariate analysis showed full-length KIR2DS4 was the significant factor for I-IV aGVHD (HR = 2.166, 95% CI: 1.01-4.26, P = .025). Subgroup analysis showed that AML and CML patients who received donors negative for full-length KIR2DS4 have a higher cumulative incidences of cGVHD (75% vs 62%, P = .008). There were no significant effects of full-length KIR2DS4 on overall survival (P = .13), relapse-free survival (P = .14), CMV reactivation (P = .52), and relapse (HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.09-1.6, P = .1875). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated a significant correlation of donor full-length KIR2DS4 on aGVHD and cGVHD. These results suggested that combining KIR and HLA genotyping may help make a better sense of transplants in these patients.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['An, Kang', 'Li, Benshang', 'Luo, Changying', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Luo, Chengjuan', 'Chen, Jing']","['An K', 'Li B', 'Luo C', 'Wang J', 'Luo C', 'Chen J']","[""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200627,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,['NOTNLM'],"['*KIR2DS4', '*NK cell', '*acute GVHD', '*allogeneic hematopoietic SCT', '*chronic GVHD']",,2020/07/01 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2020/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13728 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Sep;24(6):e13728. doi: 10.1111/petr.13728.

The antileukemic part consists of fludarabine, cytosine arabinoside, and amsacrine (FLAMSA); non-cross reactive agents like fludarabine and amsacrine have been successfully used in cases of refractoriness and relapse. Immunosuppressive conditioning and transplantation follow after only 3 days of rest. This way, the toxicity of allogeneic transplantation could be reduced and the anti-leukemia effects by using allogeneic immune cells could be optimized. This review summarizes available data on efficacy and toxicity of this approach. Further, possible strategies for improvements are discussed in order to provide better chances for elderly and frail patients and patients with advanced and high-risk disease.

Glycosylation is increased in patients with immunoglobulin LC amyloidosis (AL) and rarely changes over the course of a patient's lifetime. To determine the rates of progression to AL and other plasma cell disorders (PCDs), we used residual serum samples from the Olmsted monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) screening cohort. Four-hundred and fourteen patients with known MGUS were tested by MASS-FIX, and 25 (6%) were found to have glycosylated LCs. With a median follow-up of surviving patients of 22.2 years, the 20-year progression rates to a malignant PCD were 67% (95% CI 29%, 84%) and 13% (95% CI 9%, 18%) for patients with and without glycosylated LCs, respectively. The risk of progression was independent of Mayo MGUS risk score. The respective rates of progression to AL at 20 years were 21% (95% CI 0.0%, 38%) and 3% (95% CI 0.6%, 5.5%). In summary, monoclonal LC glycosylation is a potent risk factor for progression to AL, myeloma, and other PCDs, an observation which could lead to earlier diagnoses and potentially reduced morbidity and mortality.",,"['Dispenzieri, Angela', 'Larson, D R', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Kyle, R A', 'Kumar, S K', 'Kourelis, Taxiarchis', 'Arendt, Bonnie', 'Willrcih, Maria', 'Dasari, Surendra', 'Murray, David']","['Dispenzieri A', 'Larson DR', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Kyle RA', 'Kumar SK', 'Kourelis T', 'Arendt B', 'Willrcih M', 'Dasari S', 'Murray D']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. dispenzieri.angela@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. dispenzieri.angela@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200627,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC7529948,,,,2020/07/01 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/06/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0940-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0940-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Oct;34(10):2749-2753. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0940-8.

This retrospective case series investigated the efficacy of the pediatric BFM-90 regimen in adult patients and evaluated the role of early response assessment by positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) in predicting outcomes. Methods: Patients aged 15 years or older with T-LBL diagnosed at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India were given chemotherapy according to the European BFM-90 protocol (n = 38). The patients were evaluated for early response by interim PET-CT, post-induction and monitored for toxicity and long-term outcomes. Results: Thirty-eight consecutive patients (median age 23.5 years) were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 33.5 (1-77) months, following induction, 35 out of 38 patients (92.1%) had achieved complete response (CR) on PET-CT. Thirty (78.9%) patients treated according to BFM-90 were alive in first remission. Three-year event-free survival for those with CR on PET-CT was 78%, against no survivors for those who remained PET-positive. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of BFM-90 approach in adults with T-LBL.

In the present work, cutting-edge bioinformatic methods were applied to re-analyze experimental data on leukemia cells (human myelogenous leukemia cell line THP-1 and acute myeloid leukemia MOLM-13 cells) treated for 6 h with two different Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins (RIPs), namely Shiga toxin type 1 (400 ng/mL) produced by Escherichia coli strains and the plant toxin stenodactylin (60 ng/mL), purified from the caudex of Adenia stenodactyla Harms. This analysis allowed us to identify the common early transcriptional response to 28S rRNA damage based on gene-regulatory network inference and Master Regulator Analysis (MRA). Both toxins induce a common response at 6 h which involves inflammatory mediators triggered by AP-1 family transcriptional factors and ATF3 in leukemia cells.

However, little is known about the downstream target genes activated by augmented NFE2 levels.

DESIGN: Small RNA sequencing was conducted in exosomes isolated from EuESC of women with endometriosis-associated infertility (n=3) and normal endometrial stromal cells (NESC) of fertile women without endometriosis (n=3). The differentially expressed miRNA in exosomes derived from EuESC and NESC were identified. The functions of the differentially expressed miRNA were analysed by gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing showed that the percentages of exosomal miRNA in the total small RNA isolated from EuESC and NESC were not significantly different (P=0.7804). A total of 49 differentially expressed miRNA (fold change >1.5 and P < 0.05) were identified, including 26 up-regulated and 23 down-regulated in EuESC exosomes as compared with NESC exosomes. Functional analysis revealed that 12 miRNA were predicted to target homeobox A10 (HOXA10) and/or the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) 3' untranslated region (UTR). Both HOXA10 and LIF mRNA expression levels were significantly decreased in EuESC compared with NESC (P=0.0222 and 0.0395, respectively). In addition, the predicated target genes of these differentially expressed exosomal miRNA were significantly (P < 0.05) enriched in 76 pathways, including the MAPK and Wnt signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression patterns of exosomal miRNA were identified. Many exosomal miRNA may be involved in regulating the endometrial receptivity of women with endometriosis-associated infertility.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

This has been aided by improved identification of disease phenotypes. Despite these achievements, not all severe forms of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases are successfully targeted, and current treatment options, besides allergen immunotherapy for selected allergic diseases, fail to change the disease course. T cell-based therapies aim to cure diseases through the selective induction of appropriate immune responses following the delivery of engineered, specific cytotoxic, or regulatory T cells (Tregs). Adoptive cell therapies (ACT) with genetically engineered T cells have revolutionized the oncology field, bringing curative treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, while therapies exploiting the suppressive functions of Tregs have been developed in nononcological settings, such as in transplantation and autoimmune diseases. ACT with Tregs are also being considered in nononcological settings such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and chronic inflammatory disorders. After describing the general features of T cell-based approaches and current applications in autoimmune diseases, this position paper reviews the experimental models testing or supporting T cell-based approaches, especially Treg-based approaches, in severe IgE-mediated responses and chronic respiratory airway diseases, such as severe asthma and COPD. Along with an assessment of challenges and unmet needs facing the application of ACT in these settings, this article underscores the potential of ACT to offer curative options for patients with severe or treatment-resistant forms of these immune-driven disorders.",['(c) 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Delayed diagnosis will cause anemia, increased intracranial pressure, organ failure, and even lead to death. The current main trend in this area is to use deep learning (DL) for disease diagnosis. Extracting classification information from the digital pathology images by DL may realize the automated qualitative and quantitative analysis of NHL. Previously, DL has been used to classify NHL digital pathology images with some success. However, shortcomings still exist in the data preprocessing methods and feature extraction. Therefore, this paper presents a method for the classification of NHL subtypes based on the fusion of transfer learning (TL) and principal component analysis (PCA). METHODS: First, the NHL digital pathology images were preprocessed by image division and segmentation and then input into the transfer models for fine-tuning and feature extraction. Second, PCA was used to map the extracted features. Finally, a neural network was used as a classifier to classify the mapped features. During the fine-tuning of the transfer models, two methods, freezing all feature extraction layers and fine-tuning all layers, were employed to select the optimal model with the best classification result among all the preselected transfer models. On this basis, the use of freezing the layers' location was discussed and analyzed. RESULTS: The results show that the proposed method achieved average fivefold cross-validation accuracies of 100%, 99.73%, and 99.20% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumor, and each category has standard deviations 0.00, 0.53, and 0.65, respectively, in the NHL reference dataset. The overall classification accuracy for fivefold cross-validation is 98.93%, which is an increase of 1.26% compared to the latest reported methods, having a lower standard deviation (1.00). CONCLUSION: The method proposed in this paper achieves a high classification accuracy and strong model generalization for the classification of NHL, which makes it possible to conduct intelligent classification of NHL in clinical practice. Our proposed method has definite clinical value and research significance.",['(c) 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.'],"['Zhang, Jianfei', 'Cui, Wensheng', 'Guo, Xiaoyan', 'Wang, Bo', 'Wang, Zhen']","['Zhang J', 'Cui W', 'Guo X', 'Wang B', 'Wang Z']","['School of computer and control engineering, Qiqihar university, Qiqihar, 161006, China.', 'School of computer and control engineering, Qiqihar university, Qiqihar, 161006, China.', 'School of computer and control engineering, Qiqihar university, Qiqihar, 161006, China.', 'School of computer and control engineering, Qiqihar university, Qiqihar, 161006, China.', 'School of computer and control engineering, Qiqihar university, Qiqihar, 161006, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200718,United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,['NOTNLM'],"['computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)', 'deep learning algorithm', 'lymphoma', 'principal component analysis (PCA)', 'transfer learning (TL)']",,2020/06/28 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mp.14357 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2020 Sep;47(9):4241-4253. doi: 10.1002/mp.14357.

METHODS: We calculated age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 children (age 0-14 years) from 1990 to the last available calendar year, for all neoplasms and six main cancers in childhood, in selected European countries and geographic areas, plus the European Union (EU), using data from the World Health Organization database. We carried out a joinpoint regression analysis of mortality trends for all neoplasms, leukaemia and tumours of the nervous system. Results of the joinpoint regression were summarized through annual percent change (APC) for each identified linear segment, and weighted average APC (AAPC) over the whole period. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2015, childhood total cancer mortality rates dropped by 2.8% per year in the EU, to reach 2.6/100,000 in the latest available calendar years. The greatest declines were in central-eastern countries (AAPCs -3% to -4%). Recent rates ranged between 1.7 and 4.3 deaths/100,000, with the highest values in central-eastern Europe. Leukaemia mortality rates in the EU decreased from 1.6 to 0.6/100,000 in the latest calendar years (AAPC -4%). The deepest declines were registered in central-eastern countries, though they still showed the highest rates (0.9). The lowest leukaemia mortality rates were in northern-western Europe (0.5/100,000), but also in the Czech Republic and Poland. Southern European countries showed comparatively high rates (0.8). Nervous system tumours showed relatively modest falls (AAPC: -1.7% in the EU). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer mortality continued to decline steady in Europe, though geographic differences persist. Further efforts are required to fill the gap, by promoting widespread and rational adoption of currently available treatment protocols.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies estimate that 38 % of cow-calf beef herds and 10.3 % of individual beef cows in the US are BLV seropositive. About 70 % of BLV infected animals are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, while less than 5% develop lymphosarcoma, the leading reason for carcass condemnation at the US slaughterhouses. Studies provide evidence that BLV infection leads to decreased immune function making animals more vulnerable to other diseases, which could shorten their productive lifespan and increase economic losses in the cattle industry. BLV seropositive dairy cows are reportedly more likely to be culled sooner compared with their uninfected herd mates. Beyond simple prevalence studies, little is known about the impact of BLV infection in beef cattle production or specifically on beef cow longevity. Our objective was to determine the association between BLV infection and cow longevity in beef cow-calf operations. Twenty-seven cow-calf herds from the Upper Midwest volunteered to participate in this study. Female beef cattle (n = 3146) were tested for serum BLV antibodies by ELISA. A subsample of 648 cows were also tested for BLV proviral load (PVL). Culling data was collected for the subsequent 24 months. Twenty-one herds (77.7 %) had at least one BLV-infected animal, and 29.2 % (930/3146) of tested animals were BLV seropositive. Of the BLV-positive cows, 33.7 % (318/943) were culled compared with 32.1 % (541/1682) of the seronegative cows. BLV status did not affect cows' longevity within herds (P = 0.062). However, cows with high BLV PVL had decreased survival within the herd compared with ELISA- negative cows (P = 0.01). Overall, infection with BLV did not impact beef cow longevity unless the disease had progressed to a point of high BLV PVL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The results of several clinical studies imply evidence of impaired activity of NK cells in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression of activating and inhibitory receptors of NK cells in patients with newly diagnosed AML before and after induction therapy using 7 + 3 regimen in comparison to healthy donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen AML patients aged 16-64 years as well as 16 matched healthy individuals were studied. Peripheral blood samples from patients were obtained in two steps, namely, in newly diagnosed patients and 28 days after receiving induction therapy. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the expression levels of activating receptors, including DNAM-1 and NKp46 as well as inhibitory receptors of KIR2DL1 and NKG2A. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the newly diagnosed patients showed over 50% decrease in NKp46 expression and a 6-fold increase in KIR2DL1 expression compared to healthy controls. The mRNA expression analysis in patients after induction therapy suggested a significant decrease in mRNA expressions of KIR2DL1 and NKG2A in comparison to newly diagnosed patients. CONCLUSION: Herewith, we show a statistical difference in mRNA expression levels of activating (NKp46) and inhibitory receptors from NK cells in newly diagnosed AML patients when compared with healthy controls or patients who received induction therapy, supporting the findings of researchers who reported the impaired NK cells cytotoxicity in AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Medical University of Bialystok.

Targeted drugs already changed the clinical practice in treatment of leukemias, such as imatinib (BCR/ABL inhibitor) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ibrutinib (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) in CLL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or midostaurin (FLT3 inhibitor) in AML. In this review, we focused on DNA damage response (DDR) inhibition, specifically on inhibition of ATR-CHK1 pathway. Cancer cells harbor often defects in different DDR pathways, which render them vulnerable to DDR inhibition. Some DDR inhibitors showed interesting single-agent activity even in the absence of cytotoxic drug especially in cancers with underlying defects in DDR or DNA replication. Almost no mutations were found in ATR and CHEK1 genes in leukemia patients. Together with the fact that ATR-CHK1 pathway is essential for cell development and survival of leukemia cells, it represents a promising therapeutic target for treatment of leukemia. ATR-CHK1 inhibition showed excellent results in preclinical testing in acute and chronic leukemias. However, results in clinical trials are so far insufficient. Therefore, the ongoing and future clinical trials will decide on the success of ATR/CHK1 inhibitors in clinical practice of leukemia treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. RESULTS: BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We aimd to identify a novel lncRNA, named lncRNA activated in metastatic PCa (lncAMPC), and investigate its mechanisms and clinical significance in PCa. First, the biological capacity of lncAMPC in PCa was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The lncAMPC was overexpressed in tumor tissue and urine of metastatic PCa patients and promoted PCa tumorigenesis and metastasis. Then, a mechanism study was conducted to determine how the lncAMPC-activated pathway contributed to PCa metastasis and immunosuppression. In the cytoplasm, lncAMPC upregulated LIF expression by sponging miR-637 and inhibiting its activity. In the nucleus, lncAMPC enhanced LIFR transcription by decoying histone H1.2 away from the upstream sequence of the LIFR gene. The lncAMPC-activated LIF/LIFR expressions stimulated the Jak1-STAT3 pathway to simultaneously maintain programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein stability and promote metastasis-associated gene expression. Finally, the prognostic value of the expression of lncAMPC and its downstream genes in PCa patients was evaluated. High LIF/LIFR levels indicated shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the lncAMPC/LIF/LIFR axis plays a critical role in PCa metastasis and immunosuppression and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have achieved unprecedented clinical responses in patients with B cell leukemias and lymphomas and could prove highly efficacious in AML. However, a significant number of patients with AML may not receive treatment with an autologous product due to manufacturing failures associated with low lymphocyte counts or rapid disease progression while the therapeutic is being produced. We report the preclinical evaluation of an off-the-shelf CAR T cell therapy targeting Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) for the treatment of AML. Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) targeting various epitopes in the extracellular region of FLT3 were inserted into CAR constructs and tested for their ability to redirect T cell specificity and effector function to FLT3(+) AML cells. A lead CAR, exhibiting minimal tonic signaling and robust activity in vitro and in vivo, was selected and then modified to incorporate a rituximab-responsive off-switch in cis. We found that allogeneic FLT3 CAR T cells, generated from healthy-donor T cells, eliminate primary AML blasts but are also active against mouse and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, indicating risk of myelotoxicity. By employing a surrogate CAR with affinity to murine FLT3, we show that rituximab-mediated depletion of FLT3 CAR T cells after AML eradication enables bone marrow recovery without compromising leukemia remission. These results support clinical investigation of allogeneic FLT3 CAR T cells in AML and other FLT3(+) hematologic malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

The development of GSC-targeting drugs relies on the discovery of GSC-preferential molecular modifications and the relevant signaling pathways. In this work, we investigated the protein sumoylation status, the major sumoylated substrate, and the key regulatory enzyme in GSCs to explore the therapeutic potential of disrupting protein sumoylation for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. METHODS: Patient-derived GSCs, primary GBM sections, and intracranial GBM xenografts were used to determine protein sumoylation and the related molecular mechanisms by immunoblot, quantitative PCR, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Orthotopic GBM xenograft models were applied to investigate the inhibition of tumor growth by disrupting protein sumoylation with short hairpin (sh)RNAs or molecular inhibitors. RESULTS: We show that high levels of small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1)-but not SUMO2/3-modified sumoylation are preferentially present in GSCs. The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a major SUMO1-sumoylated substrate in GSCs, whose sumoylation facilitates its interaction with c-Myc to stabilize c-Myc proteins. The prolyl-isomerase Pin1 is preferentially expressed in GSCs and functions as the key enzyme to promote SUMO1 sumoylation. Disruption of SUMO1 sumoylation by Pin1 silencing with shRNAs or inhibition with its inhibitor Juglone markedly abrogated GSC maintenance and mitigated GSC-driven tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that high SUMO1-modified protein sumoylation as a feature of GSCs is critical for GSC maintenance, suggesting that targeting SUMO1 sumoylation may effectively improve GBM treatment.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Rather than present a resume of the proceedings, we address some of the topical translational science research and clinically relevant topics in detail. We consider how recent studies using single-cell genomics and other molecular methods reveal novel aspects of hematopoiesis which in turn raise the possibility of new therapeutic approaches for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). We discuss how alternative therapies could benefit patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who develop BCR-ABL1 mutant subclones following ABL1-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

This study aimed to compare mortality from selected cancers between male mechanics and the general population of the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. METHODS: Data on deaths, occurred between 2006-2017, among male mechanics and the general population, were obtained from the Mortality Information System. Occupations were classified using the Brazilian Classification of Occupations. Mortality Odds Ratio (MOR) and confidence intervals (95%) for selected cancers among mechanics, stratified by age (30-49, 50-69 years), race, and education compared to the general population, were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: In general, mechanics showed higher mortality from oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, lung and bladder cancers, but lower mortality for all leukemias. Oropharynx and larynx cancer mortality risk was slightly higher among older mechanics, while hypopharynx cancer mortality was more noticeable among the youngest. Lower mortality from all leukemias was observed only among younger mechanics. Mortality by oropharynx and larynx cancers were higher among white mechanics. They were also the only ones to experience higher mortality by hypopharynx cancer, while lung cancer mortality were increased only among non-white ones. Mechanics of all educational levels were more likely to die by the oropharynx cancer. Those with 1-7 and 8 or more years of schooling also showed excess of death by the cancers of larynx and all leukemias. Significantly higher mortality by pancreas cancer was only observed among mechanics with no education, while those with 1-7 years of schooling showed higher risk to die by lung and bladder cancers. Those with 8 or more years of schooling show increased mortality risk for hypopharynx cancer. Increased mortality risk for myeloid leukemia was only observed when stratified by region of residence.

However, the availability of a best approach to maximize NK cell anticancer potential is still awaited. It is well established that cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells have the potential to differentiate after a short period of preactivation with interleukins-IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 and exhibit increased responses to cytokine or activating receptor restimulation for weeks to months after preactivation. We demonstrated that NK cells differentiated from CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood show increased antitumor potential in vitro against different cancer cells. Using flow cytometry, we found that NK cells were able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro. We further analysed surviving gene expression by quantitative real time PCR and reported that NK cells cause down regulation of survivin gene expression in tumor cells. Therefore, NK cell therapy represents a promising immunotherapy for cancers like AML and other haematological malignancies. It concluded that NK cells can be differentiated from CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood ,are able to induce apoptosis and induce increased antitumor potential in vitro against different cancer cells besides cause downregulation of survivin gene expression in tumor cells.

This study is very relevant because the data concerning BCR-ABL gene transcript types is very limited in Indonesia. Furthermore, it is important for patient's management, particularly in defining the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy and monitoring after therapy. The introduction of TKIs has become a major advance in the management of patients with CML, especially in the chronic phase (CML-CP), in which most patients are diagnosed. METHODS: One hundred eighty five (185) of 370 recruited patients were included in this study (2010-2014). RNA samples were isolated from mononuclear cells of peripheral blood of the subjects taken at primary diagnosis. Detection of BCR-ABL gene transcript types was done using multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (multiplex RT-PCR) and/or nested PCR following the cDNA synthesis. When the first PCR set failed to amplify the BCR-ABL gene, RT-conventional PCR and/or nested PCR would be applied. The proportion of each transcript type was calculated among the BCR-ABL positive CML patients. RESULTS: Approximately 99% (183/185) of CML patients are BCR-ABL positive, with the most common type is major b3a2 (136/183; 74.3%), followed by major b2a2 (41/183; 22.4%). Two samples (1.1%) showed co-expression of b3a2 and b2a2; 1 sample showed co-expression of b3a2 and fragment at 500bp; and 3 samples showed uncommon fragments.

These cases are called immune or cure and models for handling the data included cure fraction rate, are referred to as cure model or long-term survival models. METHODS: The data for this historical cohort study, were collected from leukemia patients diagnosed between 2007 to 2014 and followed up until 2016 in Taleghani hospital and received BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant). Some data had to be excluded because of incomplete information. Using recorded files mostly and phone calls rarely, were made to confirm whether the patients were still alive or not. Death due to leukemia was regarded as interested event. Analysis were performed by R version 3.4.1and Stata version 14.

However, CAR-T cell therapies are prohibitively expensive to manufacture. The authors demonstrate the manufacture of human CAR-T cells from multiple donors in an automated stirred-tank bioreactor. The authors successfully produced functional human CAR-T cells from multiple donors under dynamic conditions in a stirred-tank bioreactor, resulting in overall cell yields which were significantly better than in static T-flask culture. At agitation speeds of 200 rpm and greater (up to 500 rpm), the CAR-T cells are able to proliferate effectively, reaching viable cell densities of >5 x 10(6) cells ml-1 over 7 days. This is comparable with current expansion systems and significantly better than static expansion platforms (T-flasks and gas-permeable culture bags). Importantly, engineered T-cells post-expansion retained expression of the CAR gene and retained their cytolytic function even when grown at the highest agitation intensity. This proves that power inputs used in this study do not affect cell efficacy to target and kill the leukemia cells. This is the first demonstration of human CAR-T cell manufacture in stirred-tank bioreactors and the findings present significant implications and opportunities for larger-scale allogeneic CAR-T production.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Virus monitoring among the sheep and cattle herds is usually done by vaccination. Inactivated virus vaccines can partially protect the livestock from viral challenge. However, vaccinated animals are likely to be infected. So, there is an essential need for producing vaccine by other methods. Gp60 SU, encoded by Env gene, is the surface glycoprotein of BLV detected to be the major target for the host immunity against the virus. Different stages were performed to predict the potential B and T-helper cell epitopes. The general framework of the method includes retrieving the amino acid sequence of gp60 SU, conducting the sequence alignment, getting the entropy plot, retrieving the previously found epitopes, predicting the hydropathy parameters, modelling the tertiary structure of the glycoprotein, minimizing the structure energy, validating the model by Ramachandran plot, predicting the linear and discontinuous epitopes by various servers and eventually choosing the consensus immunogenic regions. Ramachandran plot scrutiny has demonstrated that the modelled prediction is accurate and suitable. By surveying overlaps of various results, 4 and 2 immunogenic regions were selected as linear and conformational epitopes respectively. Amino acids 35-53, 67-97, 288-302 and 410-421 and those of numbers 37-58 and 72-100 were the regions selected as linear and conformational epitopes respectively. The tertiary structure of the final epitope was modelled as well. A comparison of the predicted epitopes structure with that of gp60 SU envelope, illustrated that the tertiary structure of these epitopes does not change after being separated from the primary complete one. The present achievements will lead to a better interpretation of the antigen-antibody interactions against gp60 in the designing process of safe and efficient vaccines.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

PAX5(P80R) has recently been described as a distinct genetic B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtype with a favorable prognosis in adults. In contrast, an unfavorable outcome has been observed in children. Our aim was to determine the frequency of PAX5(P80R) in childhood BCP-ALL treated according to the Associazione Italiana Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (AIEOP-BFM) ALL 2000 protocol and to evaluate its clinical significance within this study cohort. The analyses included 1237 patients with ALL treated in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 trial with complete information for copy number variations (CNVs) of IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, EBF1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and ERG. A customized TaqMan genotyping assay was used to screen for PAX5(P80R) . Sanger sequencing was used to confirm PAX5(P80R) -positive results as well as to screen for second variants in PAX5. Agilent CGH + SNP arrays (e-Array design 85 320; Agilent Technologies) were performed in PAX5(P80R) -positive patients to verify additional CNVs. Almost 2% (20/1028) of our BCP-ALL cohort were PAX5(P80R) -positive. White blood cell counts higher than 50 000/mul as well as male sex were significantly (P < .05) associated with PAX5(P80R) . Most of the PAX5(P80R) -positive cases were 10 years of age or older. PAX5(P80R) -positive samples were enriched for deletions affecting PAX5, IKZF1, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B. Compared to PAX5(P80R) -wildtype BCP-ALL, PAX5(P80R) -positive patients showed a significantly reduced 5-year overall survival (P = .042). Further studies should evaluate the interaction of PAX5(P80R) with other genetic aberrations to further stratify intermediate risk pediatric BCP-ALL.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

SNHG1 silencing markedly repressed AML cell growth, whereas SNHG1 overexpression had the opposite effect. MicroRNA-489-3p (miR-489-3p) was identified as a SNHG1-targeting miRNA. SNHG1 knockdown increased miR-489-3p expression. Low expression of miR-489-3p was correlated with high expression of SNHG1 in AML tissues. miR-489-3p overexpression restricted AML cell growth, and SRY-related high-mobility-group box 12 (SOX12) was identified as a miR-489-3p-targeting gene.

OBJECTIVE: To assess, by diffusion tensor imaging, microstructural integrity of white matter in paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) following intrathecal and intravenous chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven children diagnosed with de novo ALL underwent MRI scans of the brain with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) prior to commencement of chemotherapy and at 12 months after diagnosis, using a 3-tesla (T) MRI scanner. We investigated the changes in DTI parameters in white matter tracts before and after chemotherapy using tract-based spatial statistics overlaid on the International Consortium of Brain Mapping DTI-81 atlas. All of the children underwent formal neurodevelopmental assessment at the two study time points. RESULTS: Whole-brain DTI analysis showed significant changes between the two time points, affecting several white matter tracts. The tracts demonstrated longitudinal changes of decreasing mean and radial diffusivity. The neurodevelopment of the children was near compatible for age at the end of ALL treatment.

The disease is driven by mutations in proto-oncogenes such as BRAF and MEK, while immune-mediated mechanisms contribute to disease development and progression. The clinical presentation of ECD is highly heterogeneous, ranging from smouldering unifocal forms to multiorgan life-threatening disease. Almost any organ can be involved, but the most common lesions include long-bone involvement, retroperitoneal fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, pericardial and myocardial infiltration, CNS, retro-orbital, and large-vessel involvement. These manifestations may mimic those of neoplastic and systemic immune-mediated diseases. Overlap with these conditions represents an emerging challenge for the clinician. A variety of treatments are efficacious for ECD, targeting both the MAPK-pathway and the immune-mediated pathomechanisms. The traditional approach is based on immunomodulatory agents (interferon-alpha), but recent alternatives-including anti-cytokine therapies (IL1- and TNFalpha-blockers) and immunosuppressants (mTOR-inhibitors)-showed promising results. However, since the detection of MAPK pathway activation in most patients and the dramatic efficacy of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, these targeted treatments represent the first-line approach in patients with severe disease forms. High rates of radiologic responses do not often mean clinical remission, especially for CNS involvement, which often results in chronic disability. This review will outline the main clinical features of ECD, with emphasis on the emerging challenges in pathogenesis and management, and on the role of recent targeted approaches.",,"['Pegoraro, Francesco', 'Papo, Matthias', 'Maniscalco, Valerio', 'Charlotte, Frederic', 'Haroche, Julien', 'Vaglio, Augusto']","['Pegoraro F', 'Papo M', 'Maniscalco V', 'Charlotte F', 'Haroche J', 'Vaglio A']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of Firenze, Firenze, Italy.', 'Sorbonne University, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux, Internal Medicine 2, Histiocytosis National Reference Centre, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR1163 and CNRS URL 8254, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Firenze, Firenze, Italy.', ""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Medecine Interne 2 maladies auto-immunes et systemiques, Centre National de References des Histiocytoses, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Department of Biomedical, Experimental and Clinical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Firenze, and Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, Meyer Children\'s Hospital, Firenze, Italy. augusto.vaglio@unifi.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200626,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2020/06/28 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/06/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0944-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0944-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Nov;34(11):2840-2857. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0944-4.

Using high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening in AML cell lines, we identified LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) as a potential novel target for AML treatment. High LIMK1 expression was significantly correlated with shorter survival of AML patients and coincided with FLT3 mutations, KMT2A rearrangements, and elevated HOX gene expression. RNAi- and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated suppression as well as pharmacologic inhibition of LIMK1 and its close homolog LIMK2 reduced colony formation and decreased proliferation due to slowed cell-cycle progression of KMT2A-rearranged AML cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples. This was accompanied by morphologic changes indicative of myeloid differentiation. Transcriptome analysis showed upregulation of several tumor suppressor genes as well as downregulation of HOXA9 targets and mitosis-associated genes in response to LIMK1 suppression, providing a potential mechanistic basis for the anti-leukemic phenotype. Finally, we observed a reciprocal regulation between LIM kinases (LIMK) and CDK6, a kinase known to be involved in the differentiation block of KMT2A-rearranged AML, and addition of the CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib further enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of LIMK inhibition.

Although novel therapeutics have improved patient prognosis, drug resistance remains a key problem. Here, we show that the SRC-family tyrosine kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK), which is primarily expressed in the hematopoietic lineage but not in mature B cells, is aberrantly expressed in MCL, and that high expression of HCK is associated with inferior prognosis of MCL patients. HCK expression is controlled by the toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor protein MYD88 and can be enhanced by TLR agonists in MCL cell lines and primary MCL. In line with this, primary MCL with high HCK expression are enriched for a TLR-signaling pathway gene set. Silencing of HCK expression results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, HCK controls integrin-mediated adhesion of MCL cells to extracellular matrix and stromal cells. Taken together, our data indicate that TLR/MYD88-controlled aberrant expression of HCK plays a critical role in MCL proliferation and survival as well as in retention of the malignant cells in the growth- and survival-supporting lymphoid organ microenvironment, thereby contributing to lymphomagenesis.

To identify specific vulnerabilities in ALL, we performed a drug screen using primary human ALL samples cultured in a model of the bone marrow microenvironment combined with high content image analysis. Among the 2487 FDA-approved compounds tested, anthelmintic agents of the class of macrocyclic lactones exhibited potent anti-leukemia activity, similar to the already known anti-leukemia agents currently used in induction chemotherapy. Ex vivo validation in 55 primary ALL samples of both precursor B cell and T-ALL including refractory relapse cases confirmed strong anti-leukemia activity with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Anthelmintic agents increased intracellular chloride levels in primary leukemia cells, inducing mitochondrial outer membrane depolarization and cell death. Supporting the notion that simultaneously targeting cell death machineries at different angles may enhance the cell death response, combination of anthelmintic agents with the BCL-2 antagonist navitoclax or with the chemotherapeutic agent dexamethasone showed synergistic activity in primary ALL.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the molecular profile of Egyptian patients with MPN subtypes and correlate with clinicopathological status. METHODS: A series of 200 patients with MPNs (92 polycythemia vera, 68 essential thrombocythemia, and 40 primary myelofibrosis) were included in this study. DNA from each sample was amplified using polymerase chain reaction to detect Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations. Sanger sequencing was used to determine the mutation types. RESULTS: Of the 200 samples, 44% had JAK2V617F and 10% were carrying CALR mutation with type 2 being the most frequent type in this study (55%). No MPL or JAK2 exon 12 mutations were detected. All clinical and hematological data had no differences with other populations except that our CALR-positive patients showed a decrease in the platelet count compared with JAK2V617F-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Our study on Egyptian patients shows a specific molecular profile of JAK2 mutation, and CALR mutation type 2 was higher than type 1.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Differential effects between SUMO paralogs are emerging such as their distinctive regulations of IFN synthesis, of IFN signaling and of the expression and function of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products. Several restriction factors are conjugated to SUMO and their modifications are further enhanced in response to IFN. Also, IFN itself was shown to increase global cellular SUMOylation and requires the presence of the E3 SUMO ligase PML that coordinates the assembly of PML nuclear bodies.

In many species, this process is achieved by the localization of maternal factors into discrete regions of the egg. However, in other animals, like in amniotes and in echinoderms, the considerable plasticity of the early blastomeres seems to preclude the existence of maternal determinants and the mechanisms by which the radial symmetry of the egg is broken remain largely enigmatic. In this chapter, we review recent progress on the identification of maternal components involved in symmetry breaking and dorsal-ventral (D/V) axis formation of the sea urchin embryo. We will first review some key experiments on D/V axis formation from classical embryologists that provided evidence for a weak maternal D/V prepattern. We will then detail more recent molecular analyses that established the critical role played by Nodal signaling in allocating cell fates along the secondary axis and led to the discovery that maternal transcription factors such as the Sry-related HMG box B1 (SoxB1), the Octamer binding factor1/2 (Oct1/2), the T-cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) and the Erythroblastosis virus E26 Oncogene Homolog (ETS) domain transcriptional repressor Translocation-Ets-Leukemia virus protein (Yan/Tel) as well as maternal signaling molecules like Univin are essential for the initiation of nodal expression. Finally, we will describe recent advances that uncovered a role in symmetry breaking and dorsal-ventral axis orientation for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-like factor Panda, which appears to be both necessary and sufficient for D/V axis orientation. Therefore, even in the highly regulative sea urchin embryo, the activity of localized maternal factors provides the embryo with a blueprint of the D/V axis.",['(c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

M3v phenotype is a less common presentation of APL and these patients usually present with leukocytosis and abnormal promyelocytes that are characterized by sparse granulation and are less likely to have faggot cells with multiple Auer rods. Distinguishing M3v phenotype from acute febrile illness can be challenging as the diagnosis relies on examination of peripheral smear. PATIENT CONCERNS: Fifty-seven-year-old female who presented after recent trip to Dominican Republic for high grade fever and gum bleeding. She was exposed to patients with Dengue fever during her stay. At presentation, patient had leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and urinalysis showing bacteria and white cell. She was started on treatment for urinary tract infection. Patient remained febrile and thrombocytopenia worsened. On day 2, flow cytometry of the peripheral smear showed 43% medium sized blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was positive for promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with APL.

In addition, although data on the molecular pathogenesis of ANKL has been reported, evaluation of such data in a clinicopathologic context remains limited. Patients diagnosed with ANKL were identified retrospectively. Detailed demographic and clinicopathologic data were analyzed. We assessed novel markers by immunohistochemistry and performed targeted next-generation sequencing analysis. The study group included 9 men and 3 women with a median age at diagnosis of 47.5 years (range, 20 to 75 y). Two distinct patterns of bone marrow involvement were identified: interstitial and sinusoidal. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD56 and CD94, and negative for surface CD3, CD5, and CD57 in all cases assessed. They were also positive for CD2 (10/12), c-MYC (6/8), BCL2 (6/8), CD16 (5/7), EBER (9/12), CD7 (6/11), pSTAT3 (3/8), CD8 (2/6), PD-L1 (2/8), CD4 (2/11), CD8 (2/6), and CD158 (1/5).

There has been a lot of improvement in supportive care in FN that has drastically reduced the infection-related mortality in these patients. The focus now is on reducing infection-related morbidity, healthcare costs and optimizing the quality of life of the child as well as their family during these episodes. In this study, biomarkers were studied as predictors of outcome so that outcome can be predicted earlier, and treatment modified accordingly. OBJECTIVE: To measure procalcitonin levels (at baseline and day 3), procalcitonin clearance, neutrophil CD64 expression levels (at baseline) and monocyte HLA-DR expression levels (at baseline), and their correlation with outcome. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. STUDY TYPE: Cross-sectional observational study. POPULATION/PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five episodes of FN in children below 12 years with lymphoreticular malignancies. Children receiving antibacterial and/or antifungal treatment within the last 7 days were excluded from the study. METHODS: The subjects recruited into the study had undergone complete clinical and laboratory evaluation as per hospital protocol. Procalcitonin (day 0 and 3), neutrophil CD64 expression, and monocytic HLA-DR expression levels were measured in these patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five episodes of FN were studied in children with lymphoreticular malignancy. It was found that procalcitonin and HLA-DR are very good markers of outcome, whereas CD64 although a good marker, was inferior to procalcitonin and HLA-DR in predicting outcome. Procalcitonin clearance was found to be superior to single value of procalcitonin. Furthermore, procalcitonin on day 3 was found to be a better predictor of outcome compared with its baseline value. Also, it was found that procalcitonin and HLA-DR had a significant correlation with baseline C-reactive protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the findings of the study we suggest that serial monitoring of procalcitonin levels be used in febrile neutropenic children with cancer. Procalcitonin levels on day 3 alone can be offered in resource poor setting. The role of HLA-DR and CD64 also seems promising and needs to be further explored in larger multicentric studies.",,"['Gomber, Sunil', 'Banerjee, Anindya', 'Dewan, Pooja', 'Das, Shukla', 'Ansari, M Ahmad', 'Rai, Gargi', 'Singh, Praveen']","['Gomber S', 'Banerjee A', 'Dewan P', 'Das S', 'Ansari MA', 'Rai G', 'Singh P']","['Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Microbiology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi.', 'Microbiology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi.', 'Microbiology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi.', 'Microbiology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,,,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001870 [doi]', '00043426-202008000-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;42(6):e416-e422. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001870.,,6,,20201231,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Procalcitonin)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Procalcitonin/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our retrospective study analyzed outcomes in patients with chromosome 17 (ch17) abnormalities who received conventional chemotherapy followed by allo-HCT versus those who did not receive a transplant. We analyzed whether poor outcomes extend to patients with all types of ch17 abnormalities and the impact of concomitant TP53 gene mutations assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed diagnostic and outcome data on 98 patients treated at our institution from 2012 to 2018 with AML or MDS who possessed ch17 abnormalities by cytogenetic analysis. The presence of TP53 mutations was analyzed by NGS. Primary endpoint of our study was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 61 patients with AML and 37 with MDS were included. Complete remission (CR) with first line treatment was similar between induction chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents (HMA), 22.9 % versus 21.6 % (p = 0.33). Median OS for all patients (with or without transplant) was 10 months. Patients with abnormal ch17 in conjunction with any TP53 mutation(s) exhibited worse OS compared to patients without a TP53 mutation (10 versus 23 months, p = 0.02). 30 patients (19 AML, 11 MDS) underwent HCT, with a median OS of 11 months. For AML patients who underwent allo-HCT, 18 were in CR (13 with cytogenetic remission) and 1 had persistent disease at transplant. In the MDS cohort, 3 patients were in CR (2 with cytogenetic remission) and 8 had stable disease. Post allo-HCT survival of AML and MDS cohorts did not differ (p = 0.6), although cytogenetic CR at time of HCT trended towards improved OS (17 versus 8 months; p = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: AML/MDS patients with ch17 abnormalities have poor outcomes with or without HCT. Our results show that patients with ch17 abnormalities and TP53 mutations have a significantly poorer survival compared to patients who have ch17 abnormalities but no TP53 mutations. Drugs targeting abnormalities of the p53 pathway, improvement in depth of response prior to HCT, and novel maintenance strategies are needed for improved outcomes in these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 344 children with ALL younger than 17 years old at diagnosis identified in pediatric department of Peking University People's Hospital. The children were divided into three groups: conventional chemotherapy group, imatinib group and dasatinib group. Height was expressed as standard deviation score(HtSDS). In the three groups, we compared the HtSDS and big up tri, openHtSDS at the start of treatment and during follow-up period and also compared the adult height and median parental height(MPH). We further compared the HtSDS classified by age and gender in imatinib group. At last, univariate analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors on the deceleration of height growth by imatinib. RESULTS: There were 298 children in conventional chemotherapy group, 39 in imatinib group and 7 in dasatinib group. In imatinib group, the mean HtSDS of children at follow-up time was significantly lower than that at the start of treatment (P < 0.05), regardless of age and gender. In imatinib group, the decrease of HtSDS in girls was more obvious than in boys(P = 0.031). The HtSDS gradually decreased in the first and the second year in imatinib group. After discontinuation of imatinib, the HtSDS had no obvious change. Multivariate analysis showed that the HtSDS at the start of imatinib was negatively correlated with severe growth impairment on imatinib therapy. The HtSDS in dasatinib group and conventional chemotherapy group maintained a high degree of consistency. CONCLUSION: Imatinib can affect growth velocity in children with ALL, regardless of age and gender. With the discontinuation of imatinib, the inhibitory effect will not continue.

The protein is best known for its role in RAS signaling. LGALS1 is important in acute lymphoblastic leukemia but its role in acute myeloid leukemia is not well defined. We previously found suppression of LGALS1 in AML cell lines OCI-AML3 and THP-1 sensitized both cell lines to BCL2 inhibitor ABT-737. In this study, we used an in vivo murine OCI-AML3 xenograft model to test whether reduction expression of LGALS1 affects survival. Mice bearing the OCI-AML3 cells with LGALS1 shRNA survived significantly longer than mice with control OCI-AML3 cells. Gene expression profiling using RNASeq was performed using the control and LGALS1 shRNA of p53 WT OCI-AML3 and p53 mutant THP-1 cells. The data reveal distinct differences between the two cell lines in number of genes affected, in pathways associated with these genes, in expression of oncogenes, and in the transcription factors involved. The p53 pathway is prominent in OCI-AML3 cells. An examination of LGALS1 mRNA in an AML patient population reveals elevated LGALS1 mRNA is associated with shorter disease free survival and increased blasts in the BM. This data with the xenograft model data presented suggest LGALS1 may be important in the AML microenvironment. In summary, the data presented here suggest that a strategy targeting LGALS1 may benefit AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that binds to the small extracellular loop of CD20 and has greater in vitro complement-mediated cytotoxicity than rituximab. In this study, we assessed the activity and safety of ofatumumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative CD20-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: This was a single-arm, phase 2 trial done at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Patients with newly diagnosed, Ph-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma with CD20 expression of at least 1% were eligible. Patients were treated with up to eight courses of the hyper-CVAD regimen (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) on courses 1, 3, 5, and 7 alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine on courses 2, 4, 6, and 8. Ofatumumab was administered on days 1 and 11 of courses 1 and 3 and on days 1 and 8 of courses 2 and 4 for a total of eight doses. The first dose of ofatumumab was 300 mg intravenously and all subsequent doses were 2000 mg intravenously. Patients received 30 courses of maintenance therapy with 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone (POMP), with four intensification courses (high-dose methotrexate plus L-asparaginase and hyper-CVAD plus ofatumumab on courses 6-7 and 18-19). The primary endpoints were event-free survival, overall response, and overall survival. All enrolled patients were included in the primary and safety analyses. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01363128. FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2011, and May 18, 2017, 69 patients (67 patients had B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and two had B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma; median age 41 years [IQR 32-50]) were enrolled and treated, including 33 (48%) aged between 18 and 39 years. Nine (27%) of 33 patients had Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. With a median follow-up of 44 months (26-53), 4-year event-free survival was 59% (95% CI 48-73); 69% (54-87) in adolescents and young adults aged 18-39 years. 4-year overall survival was 68% (58-81); 74% (60-91) in adolescents and young adults. The overall response rate was 98% (64 of 65 patients). The most common non-haematological grade 3 or 4 adverse events were infections (35 [54%] of 65 patients during induction and 53 [78%] of 68 patients during consolidation). Ten (14%) of 69 patients died in complete remission from sepsis (two [3%]), cardiac arrest (one [1%]), therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (two [3%]), and haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation complications (five [7%]). None of these deaths were considered related to ofatumumab treatment by the study investigators. INTERPRETATION: The combination of hyper-CVAD plus ofatumumab is safe and active in adults with Ph-negative CD20-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Modifications of this regimen with the addition of novel monoclonal and bispecific antibody constructs targeting CD19 and CD22 might further improve outcomes and allow reduction in the intensity and duration of chemotherapy.

AMG 553 is an investigational chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy for the treatment of AML. FLT3 expression analysis and in vitro and in vivo studies were leveraged to evaluate the nonclinical safety of AMG 553. Cynomolgus monkeys administered autologous anti-FLT3 CAR T cells demonstrated no evidence of CAR T-cell-mediated toxicity, expansion, or persistence, likely due to restricted cell surface FLT3 protein expression in healthy animals. This highlights the limited value of such in vivo studies for safety assessment of the CAR T-cell modality when directed against a target with restricted expression. To complement these studies and directly evaluate the potential toxicities of eliciting T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against cells with surface expression of FLT3 protein in vivo, data from cynomolgus monkey toxicology studies with 2 bispecific T-cell engager molecules targeting FLT3 were leveraged; findings were consistent with the targeted killing of bone marrow cells expressing cell surface FLT3. Potential AMG 553-induced cytotoxicity was assessed against a wide range of normal human primary cells and cell lines; cytotoxicity was observed against FLT3-positive AML cell lines and a percentage of primary bone marrow CD34+ cells.

Although there have been some improvements in outcomes over the past few decades, only approximately 50% of children with first relapse of ALL survive long term, and outcomes are much worse with second or later relapses. Recurrences that occur within 3 years of diagnosis and any T-ALL relapses are particularly difficult to salvage. Until recently, treatment options were limited to intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without site-directed radiotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the past decade, several promising immunotherapeutics have been developed, changing the treatment landscape for children with relapsed ALL. Current research in this field is focusing on how to best incorporate immunotherapeutics into salvage regimens and investigate long-term survival and side effects, and when these might replace HSCT. As more knowledge is gained about the biology of relapse through comprehensive genomic profiling, incorporation of molecularly targeted therapies is another area of active investigation. These advances in treatment offer real promise for less toxic and more effective therapy for children with relapsed ALL, and we present several cases highlighting contemporary treatment decision-making.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Hunger, Stephen P', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A']","['Hunger SP', 'Raetz EA']","[""The Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The Perelman School of Medicine at The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61630-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004043 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Oct 15;136(16):1803-1812. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004043.,,16,,20210614,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'Child', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant activating driver mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur in both leukemias and are particularly common in the NPM1mut subtype. In this study, transcriptional profiling after pharmacological inhibition of the menin-MLL complex revealed specific changes in gene expression, with downregulation of the MEIS1 transcription factor and its transcriptional target gene FLT3 being the most pronounced. Combining menin-MLL inhibition with specific small-molecule kinase inhibitors of FLT3 phosphorylation resulted in a significantly superior reduction of phosphorylated FLT3 and transcriptional suppression of genes downstream of FLT3 signaling. The drug combination induced synergistic inhibition of proliferation, as well as enhanced apoptosis, compared with single-drug treatment in models of human and murine NPM1mut and MLL-r leukemias harboring an FLT3 mutation. Primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells harvested from patients with NPM1mutFLT3mut AML showed significantly better responses to combined menin and FLT3 inhibition than to single-drug or vehicle control treatment, whereas AML cells with wild-type NPM1, MLL, and FLT3 were not affected by either of the 2 drugs. In vivo treatment of leukemic animals with MLL-r FLT3mut leukemia reduced leukemia burden significantly and prolonged survival compared with results in the single-drug and vehicle control groups. Our data suggest that combined menin-MLL and FLT3 inhibition represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for patients with NPM1mut or MLL-r leukemia and concurrent FLT3 mutation.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Dzama, Margarita M', 'Steiner, Marlene', 'Rausch, Johanna', 'Sasca, Daniel', 'Schonfeld, Jonas', 'Kunz, Kerstin', 'Taubert, Martha C', 'McGeehan, Gerard M', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Mupo, Annalisa', 'Hahnel, Patricia', 'Theobald, Matthias', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Koche, Richard P', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Kuhn, Michael W M']","['Dzama MM', 'Steiner M', 'Rausch J', 'Sasca D', 'Schonfeld J', 'Kunz K', 'Taubert MC', 'McGeehan GM', 'Chen CW', 'Mupo A', 'Hahnel P', 'Theobald M', 'Kindler T', 'Koche RP', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Armstrong SA', 'Kuhn MWM']","['Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Consortia for Translational Cancer Research, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Consortia for Translational Cancer Research, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Consortia for Translational Cancer Research, Mainz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Waltham, MA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', 'Welcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Consortia for Translational Cancer Research, Mainz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pulmonary Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Consortia for Translational Cancer Research, Mainz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Welcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;

Pediatric palliative care (PPC) focuses on relieving physical, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering throughout the continuum of cancer care and is considered integral to cancer care for children in all settings. There is limited evidence from LMICs about the characteristics, symptoms, and outcomes of children with cancer who receive PPC, which is needed to define the global need and guide the development of these services. METHODS: This retrospective review of clinical records of children who received PPC was conducted during a pilot project (January 2014-August 2015) that implemented a PPC team at a tertiary hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Clinical data on diagnosis, symptoms, treatment status, deaths, and key palliative care interventions were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There were 200 children who received PPC during the pilot project. The most common diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (62%) and acute myeloid leukemia (11%). Psychosocial support for children (n = 305; 53%) and management of physical symptoms (n = 181; 31%) were the most common types of interventions provided. The most frequently recorded symptoms were pain (n = 60; 30%), skin wounds (n = 16; 8%), and weakness (n = 9; 5%). The most common medications prescribed were morphine (n = 32) and paracetamol (n = 21). CONCLUSION: A hospital-based PPC service addresses pain and symptom concerns as well as psychosocial needs for children with cancer and their families in a setting where resources are limited. Health care facilities should incorporate palliative care into the care of children with cancer to address the needs of children and their families.",,"['Doherty, Megan', 'Power, Liam', 'Thabet, Chloe']","['Doherty M', 'Power L', 'Thabet C']","[""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,PMC7328118,,,,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.20.00076 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Jun;6:884-891. doi: 10.1200/GO.20.00076.,,,,20210728,,IM,"['Bangladesh/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/therapy', '*Palliative Care', 'Pilot Projects', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was the treatment of choice for CML prior to 2000, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) changed the management of this disease. This population-based analysis was conducted in the province of Ontario, Canada to gather information on treatment choices and outcomes of childhood CML. METHOD: Using a provincial childhood cancer registry and retrospective review of patient medical records for patients < 18 years diagnosed with CML between 1985 and 2018, data on presenting features, treatment, and outcomes were collected from 52 patients. RESULTS: Patients treated before the introduction of TKIs (before 2002) mainly received HSCT and had an overall survival (OS) of 64% at a median follow up of 6 years. The OS of all patients treated in the TKI era (2002 and after) was 90% at a median follow up of 3 years. All three deaths in the TKI era were related to HSCT complications. Survival of patients who remained on a TKI was significantly improved compared to those who underwent HSCT post-TKI therapy (100% vs 66%, P = .008). TKIs were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Given the increased mortality associated with HSCT in our cohort, further advances in HSCT may be required to outweigh the benefits of a TKI monotherapy approach in the majority of childhood CML patients.

Though hyperglycemia in ALL patients is usually transient, it may be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, the risk factors for and consequences of hyperglycemia are poorly understood. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia significant enough to require insulin therapy during induction chemotherapy would be associated with increased morbidity and mortality in pediatric ALL patients during induction chemotherapy and in subsequent care. METHODS: We abstracted clinical and resource utilization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database utilizing ICD-9 codes and medication charges. We used logistic regression analysis to predict the development of hyperglycemia. The effects of hyperglycemia on binary and count adverse outcomes following induction chemotherapy were modeled using mixed-effect regression models. RESULTS: An increased risk of hyperglycemia requiring insulin was associated with older age, female sex, higher risk group and trisomy 21. Patients on insulin for hyperglycemia had increased mortality following induction chemotherapy. These patients were more likely to have subsequent infectious complications, need for bone marrow transplant, and risk of disease relapse.

In this study, we investigated whether a flow cytometry assay with cytoplasmic staining for CD3 could be used for this purpose. METHODS: Flow cytometry immunophenotyping was performed on 19 surface CD3 (sCD3)-negative mature T-cell neoplasms, 10 sCD3-positive mature T-cell neoplasms, 13 mature NK-cell neoplasms, and 19 normal controls. In addition to routine antibody panels (CD2, sCD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD16, CD45, CD56, CD57, CD94, CD158a, CD158b, CD158e, NKG2A TCRgamma/delta), cytoplasmic staining for a monoclonal CD3 antibody (clone SK7/Leu-4) was assessed in all cases. A molecular study for T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement and an immunohistochemical study for TCRbeta were performed. RESULTS: Our data showed all T-cell neoplasms were uniformly positive for cytoplasmic CD3 (cCD3) regardless of sCD3 expression, whereas 85% of NK-cell neoplasms completely lacked cCD3 expression. The 2 cases with classic NK-cell immunophenotype but partial cCD3 expression showed no molecular genetic features of T-cell lineage by TCR gene rearrangement studies. CONCLUSIONS: Uniform cCD3 positivity and homogeneous cCD3 negativity highly suggest T-cell and NK lineage, respectively. When partial cCD3 expression is encountered, additional confirmatory studies should be pursued for the most accurate lineage assignment.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

A 72-year-old man with IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), status-post allogeneic cell transplantation, on ivosidenib for 6 months, was admitted for culture-negative neutropenic fever, pink and purpuric plaques and patches on the legs, abdomen and back, edema, hypotension, and shortness of breath. Skin biopsy revealed an infiltrate of atypical, immature, myeloperoxidase-positive mononuclear cells compatible with leukemia cutis or Sweet syndrome. Although dermal edema and interstitial neutrophilic infiltrate with karyorrhexis characteristic of Sweet syndrome were not seen, the atypical cells lacked expression of CD117 and CD34, which were expressed in the original leukemia. Additional immunohistochemical staining of suspected blasts was strongly positive for IDH1 R132H, suggesting a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. As the immunophenotype of blasts in skin infiltrates can significantly differ from the immunophenotype seen in blood and bone marrow, this case shows that mutation-specific antibodies such as anti-IDH1 R132H may be useful to help distinguish malignant from non-malignant infiltrates in the skin. Furthermore, differentiation syndrome may show histopathologic features of leukemia cutis on skin biopsy.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The utility of these variants in assessing risk of esophageal, gastric and endometrial cancers, as well as melanoma, glioma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphoid leukemia and multiple myeloma, has not been adequately investigated. We constructed a site-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) for each of these nine cancers using their GWAS-identified risk variants. Using data from 400 807 participants of European descent in the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort study, we estimated the hazard ratios of each cancer associated with its PRS using Cox proportional hazard models. During a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 3905 incident cases of these nine cancers were identified in the cohort. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.53 to 0.69 for these cancers. Except for esophageal cancer, significant dose-response associations were observed between PRS and cancer risk. Compared to individuals in the middle quintile (40%-60%) at an average risk, those among the highest 5% of the PRS had a twofold elevated risk of melanoma, glioma, follicular lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and a fourfold elevated risk of chronic lymphoid leukemia.

The FDA approval of two CAR-T cell products for otherwise incurable refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma has established this treatment as an effective immunotherapy option. The race for extending CAR-T therapy for various tumours is well and truly underway. However, response rates in solid organ cancers have been inadequate thus far, partly due to challenges posed by the tumour microenvironment (TME). The TME is a complex structure whose role is to subserve the persistence and proliferation of tumours as well as support their escape from immune surveillance. It presents several obstacles like inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins, immunosuppressive cells, cytokines, chemokines, stromal factors and adverse metabolic pathways. CAR structure and CAR-T therapies have evolved to overcome these obstacles, and we now have several novel CARs with improved anti-tumour activity demonstrated in xenograft models and in some clinical trials.

The reductive conversion of daunorubicin (Dau) to less active daunorubicinol (Dau-ol) is an important mechanism that contributes to the development of pharmacokinetic anthracycline resistance. Dau is a key component in many AML regimes, in which it is combined with many drugs, including all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), cytarabine, cladribine and prednisolone. In the present study, we investigated the influence of these anticancer drugs on the reductive Dau metabolism mediated by the aldo-keto reductases AKR1A1, 1B10, 1C3, and 7A2 and carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1). In incubation experiments with recombinant enzymes, cladribine and cytarabine did not significantly inhibit the activity of the tested enzymes. Prednisolone inhibited AKR1C3 with an IC50 of 41.73 microM, while ATRA decreased the activity of AKR1B10 (IC50 = 78.33 microM) and AKR1C3 (IC50 = 1.17 microM). Subsequent studies showed that AKR1C3 inhibition mediated by ATRA exhibited tight binding (Ki(app) = 0.54 microM). Further, the combination of 1 microM ATRA with different concentrations of Dau demonstrated synergistic effects in HCT116 and KG1a human cells expressing AKR1C3. Our results suggest that ATRA-mediated inhibition of AKR1C3 can contribute to the mechanisms that are hidden beyond the beneficial clinical outcome of the ATRA-Dau combination.",,"['Novotna, Eva', 'Morell, Anselm', 'Bukum, Neslihan', 'Hofman, Jakub', 'Danielisova, Petra', 'Wsol, Vladimir']","['Novotna E', 'Morell A', 'Bukum N', 'Hofman J', 'Danielisova P', 'Wsol V']","['Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove, 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove, 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove, 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove, 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove, 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove, 50005, Czech Republic. wsol@faf.cuni.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200625,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATRA', '*Anthracyclines', '*Carbonyl reducing enzymes', '*Leukaemia']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-020-02818-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-020-02818-y [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2020 Sep;94(9):3059-3068. doi: 10.1007/s00204-020-02818-y.

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in the Lazio region to further evaluate and compare the efficacy and the toxicity of Chl-R and B-R regimen in CLL patients over the age of 65. We enrolled 192 untreated CLL patients: 111 treated with B-R and 81 with Chl-R. The overall response rates (ORR; 93.6% in B-R and 86.5% in Chl-R) were not statistically different between the two groups, such as progression-free survival (PFS), time to retreatment (TTR), and overall survival (OS). The B-R group showed a higher hematological (p = 0.007) and extra-hematological (p = 0.008) toxicity. When comparing the toxicities according to age, we noted that the extra-hematological toxicity was higher in patients over the age of 75 who were treated with B-R than those treated with Chl-R (p = 0.03). This retrospective study confirms the feasibility of B-R and Chl-R in elderly untreated CLL patients. Currently, patients who are over 75 and unfit are usually treated with Chl-R. This scheme allows achieving the same ORR, PFS, TTR, and OS when compared with B-R because of hematological and extra-hematological toxicities due to B, in which a greater dose reduction has been shown in comparison to Chl.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Autore, Innocenti, Corrente, Del Principe, Rosati, Falcucci,', 'Fresa, Conte, Limongiello, Renzi, De Padua, Andriani, Pisani, Cimino, Tafuri,', 'Montanaro, Mauro, Del Poeta and Laurenti.']","['Autore, Francesco', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Corrente, Francesco', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Rosati, Serena', 'Falcucci, Paolo', 'Fresa, Alberto', 'Conte, Esmeralda', 'Limongiello, Maria Assunta', 'Renzi, Daniela', 'De Padua, Laura', 'Andriani, Alessandro', 'Pisani, Francesco', 'Cimino, Giuseppe', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Montanaro, Marco', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Laurenti, Luca']","['Autore F', 'Innocenti I', 'Corrente F', 'Del Principe MI', 'Rosati S', 'Falcucci P', 'Fresa A', 'Conte E', 'Limongiello MA', 'Renzi D', 'De Padua L', 'Andriani A', 'Pisani F', 'Cimino G', 'Tafuri A', 'Montanaro M', 'Mauro FR', 'Del Poeta G', 'Laurenti L']","['Institute of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University tor Vergata of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Ospedale Belcolle, Viterbo, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria Sant'Andrea, Rome, Italy."", 'Hematology Unit, Ospedale Santa Maria Goretti, Latina, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Fabrizio Spaziani Hospital, Frosinone, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Fabrizio Spaziani Hospital, Frosinone, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Ospedale Santa Maria Goretti, Latina, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria Sant'Andrea, Rome, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Ospedale Belcolle, Viterbo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University tor Vergata of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200610,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7298101,['NOTNLM'],"['bendamustine', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'chlorambucil', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'rituximab']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:01,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00848 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 10;10:848. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00848. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A GEO database dataset was used to analyze the expression levels of miR-145 in ALL children. The association between miR-145 and childhood prognosis was analyzed by the TARGET database data. The expression levels of miR-145 in the glucocorticoid-resistant ALL cell line CEM-C1 were increased by lipofectamine 2000-mediated transfection. Cell proliferation inhibition experiments were performed to detect the effect of miR-145 on the response of CEM-C1 cell line to glucocorticoids. The expression levels of the apoptotic, autophagic and drug resistance-associated genes and proteins were detected by qPCR and western blot analysis. Results: The expression levels of miR-145 were decreased in ALL patients (P < 0.001) and the prognosis of ALL in children with high miR-145 expression was significantly improved (P < 0.001). Increased miR-145 expression can improve the sensitivity of CEM-C1 cells to glucocorticoids. The expression levels of the proapoptotic and the anti-apoptotic genes Bax and Bcl-2 were increased and decreased, respectively, whereas the expression levels of the autophagicgenes Beclin 1 and LC were increased. In addition, the expression levels of the drug resistance gene MDR1 were decreased. Conclusion: The expression levels of miR-145 in ALL children were decreased and they were associated with disease prognosis.

Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to target Mcl-1 and sensitize the anti-NSCLC activity of Bcl-2 inhibitors. Methods: Cell proliferation was measured using sulforhodamine B and colony formation assays, and apoptosis was detected with Annexin V-FITC staining. Gene expression was manipulated using siRNAs and plasmids. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to measure mRNA and protein levels. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were used to analyze co-localization of dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and Mcl-1. Results: Suppression of DYRK1A resulted in reduced Mcl-1 expression in NSCLC cells, whereas overexpression of DYRK1A significantly increased Mcl-1 expression. Suppression of DYRK1A did not alter Mcl-1 mRNA levels, but did result in an accelerated degradation of Mcl-1 protein in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, DYRK1A mediated proteasome-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 in NSCLC cells, and DYRK1A co-localized with Mcl-1 in NSCLC cells and was co-expressed with Mcl-1 in tumor samples from lung cancer patients, suggesting that Mcl-1 may be a novel DYRK1A substrate. We showed that combined therapy with harmine and Bcl-2 antagonists significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines as well as primary NSCLC cells. Conclusions: Mcl-1 is a novel DYRK1A substrate, and the role of DYRK1A in promoting Mcl-1 stability makes it an attractive target for decreasing Bcl-2 inhibitor resistance.","['Copyright: (c) 2020, Cancer Biology & Medicine.']","['Li, Yangling', 'Zhou, Dongmei', 'Xu, Shuang', 'Rao, Mingjun', 'Zhang, Zuoyan', 'Wu, Linwen', 'Zhang, Chong', 'Lin, Nengming']","['Li Y', 'Zhou D', 'Xu S', 'Rao M', 'Zhang Z', 'Wu L', 'Zhang C', 'Lin N']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Hangzhou 310006, China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Key Laboratory of Clinical Cancer Pharmacology and Toxicology Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310006, China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Hangzhou 310006, China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Hangzhou 310006, China."", 'Institute of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, China.', ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Hangzhou 310006, China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Key Laboratory of Clinical Cancer Pharmacology and Toxicology Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310006, China."", 'Institute of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,PMC7309455,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-2 inhibitor', '*DYRK1A', '*Mcl-1', '*NSCLC', '*combination']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:01,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2019.0380 [doi]', 'j.issn.2095-3941.2019.0380 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Med. 2020 May 15;17(2):387-400. doi: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2019.0380.,,2,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8113-5585', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8392-3588']",20211004,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Dyrk kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMMUNEPOTENT-CRP (I-CRP) is an immunotherapy made of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract (bDLE) that has chemoprotective and immunomodulatory effects in different cellular populations of the immune system and antitumor activity in different cancer cell lines. Our recent results suggest that the antineoplastic effect of I-CRP is due to the characteristics of cancer cells. To confirm, we evaluated whether the selectivity is due to cell lineage or characteristics of cancer cells, testing cytotoxicity in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and their cell death mechanism. Here, we assessed the effect of I-CRP on cell viability and cell death. To determine the mechanism of cell death, we tested cell cycle, mitochondrial and nuclear alterations, and caspases and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their role in cell death mechanism. Our results show that I-CRP does not affect cell viability in noncancer cells and induces selective cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in leukemic cell lines. I-CRP also induces mitochondrial damage through proapoptotic and antiapoptotic protein modulation (Bax and Bcl-2) and ROS production, nuclear alterations including DNA damage (gamma-H2Ax), overexpression of p53, cell cycle arrest, and DNA degradation. I-CRP induced ROS-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells. Overall, here, we show that I-CRP cytotoxicity is selective to leukemic cells, inducing ROS-dependent apoptosis.

Matching of donor and recipient for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) improves the HSCT reconstitution, but donor-derived T cells reactive to non-MHC encoded minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) can induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while also being needed for graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. MiHAs are allelically variant self-peptides presented conventionally on MHC molecules, but are alloantigenic in transplantation settings. Immunodominant MiHAs are most strongly associated with GVHD and GVL. There is need for mouse paradigms to understand these contradictory effects. H60 is a highly immunodominant mouse MiHA with hematopoietic cell-restricted expression. Immunodominance of H60 is tightly associated with its allelic nature (presence vs. absence of the transcripts), and the qualitative (TCR diversity) and quantitative (frequency) traits of the reactive T cells. The identity as a hematopoietic cell-restricted antigen (HRA) of H60 assists the appearance of the immunodominace in allo-HSCT circumstances, and generation of GVL effects without induction of serious GVHD after adoptive T cell transfer. Also it allows the low avidity T cells to escape thymic negative selection and exert GVL effect in the periphery, which is a previously unevaluated finding related to HRAs. In this review, we describe the molecular features and immunobiology in detail through which H60 selectively exerts its potent GVL effect. We further describe how lessons learned can be extrapolated to human allo-HCST.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Choi, Choi, Nam, Kim and Chung.']","['Choi, Eun Young', 'Choi, Kyungho', 'Nam, Giri', 'Kim, Woojin', 'Chung, Minho']","['Choi EY', 'Choi K', 'Nam G', 'Kim W', 'Chung M']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Human Environment Interface Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200610,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7297985,['NOTNLM'],"['*H60', '*graft-versus-host-disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*hematopoieic cell-restricted antigen', '*minor histocompatibility antigen']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01163 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jun 10;11:1163. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01163. eCollection 2020.,,,,20210401,"['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (minor H antigen H60)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its role as a cancer driver is well documented in liquid tumors; however, cumulative evidence has suggested an opposite role in other tumor types. Objectives: To systematically assess the expression of SYK, its prognostic value and epigenetic status in different cancers using bioinformatics tools. Methods: In this bioinformatics study, Oncomine database and cBioPortal were used to study the SYK gene expression, Kaplan-Meier plotter to study its prognostic value and MethHC to assess the SYK gene methylation in various cancers. Results: From 542 unique analyses of the SYK gene, it was found to be overexpressed in bladder, breast and colon cancers but downregulated in leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Compared with normal tissues, breast and brain tumors showed an overexpression of the SYK gene, whereas lymphoma and leukemia had lower expression. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that SYK expression in pancreatic, gastric, liver and lung patients were correlated with better overall survival. Using cBioPortal, prostate cancer was found to have the highest SYK gene mutation frequency, and the mean expression was highest in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and thymoma. Using the MethHC database, SYK promoter hypermethylation was found to be significantly higher in breast, renal, liver, lung, pancreatic, prostatic, skin and stomach cancers compared with the normal tissue (P < 0.005). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the potential use of SYK as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for different type of cancers. However, further experimental data are required to validate these results before use of SYK in clinical settings.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Saudi Journal of Medicine & Medical Sciences.'],"['Alwithenani, Akram I', 'Althubiti, Mohammad A']","['Alwithenani AI', 'Althubiti MA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200417,India,Saudi J Med Med Sci,Saudi journal of medicine & medical sciences,101675905,PMC7305679,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'expression', 'methylation', 'mutation', 'spleen tyrosine kinase', 'survival rate']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],2020/06/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:01,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_300_19 [doi]', 'SJMMS-8-95 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi J Med Med Sci. 2020 May-Aug;8(2):95-104. doi: 10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_300_19.

In the present study, we demonstrate a critical role of beta-catenin-NF-kappaB-FPGS pathway in MTX resistance in the human T-lineage ALL cell lines. Methods: Lentivirus sh-beta-catenin was used to silence the expression of beta-catenin. Flow cytometry was performed to detect apoptosis after MTX treatment. Western blot, real-time PCR, Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Re-ChIP, and Luciferase assay were utilized to investigate the relationship among beta-catenin, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and folypoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). Results: Depletion of beta-catenin significantly increased the cytotoxicity of MTX. At the molecular level, knockdown of beta-catenin caused the increase of the protein level of FPGS and NF-kappaB p65. Furthermore, beta-catenin complexed with NF-kappaB p65 and directly bound to the FPGS promoter to regulate its expression. In addition, beta-catenin repression prolonged the protein turnover of FPGS. Conclusions: Taken together, our results demonstrate that beta-catenin may contribute to MTX resistance in leukemia cells via the beta-catenin-NF-kappaB-FPGS pathway, posing beta-catenin as a potential target for combination treatments during ALL therapy.",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],"['Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Zhang, Rui-Dong', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Gao, Chao']","['Liu SG', 'Yue ZX', 'Li ZG', 'Zhang RD', 'Zheng HY', 'Zhao XX', 'Gao C']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X"", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X"", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X"", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X"", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X"", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X"", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing, 100045 China.grid.24696.3f0000 0004 0369 153X""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200624,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC7313175,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'Folylpolyglutamate synthetase', 'Methotrexate', 'beta-catenin']",['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],2020/06/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:01,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01364-y [doi]', '1364 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Jun 24;20:271. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01364-y. eCollection 2020.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0369-4744'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite previous reports that showed histone acetylation changes upon using these agents, the exact mechanism underpinning these changes is unknown. In this study, we investigated the relative potency of the nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside analogs DHAs on DNA methylation reversal using DNA pyrosequencing. Additionally, we screened their effect on the enzymatic activity of the histone deacetylase sirtuin family (SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT5 and SIRT6) using both recombinant enzymes and nuclear lysates from leukemia cells. The nucleoside analogs (DAC, 5AC and zebularine) were the most potent DHAs and increased the enzymatic activity of SIRT6 without showing any significant increase in other sirtuin isoforms. ChIP-Seq analysis of bone marrow cells derived from six acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and treated with the nucleoside analog DAC induced genome-wide acetylation changes in H3K9, the physiological substrate for SIRT6. Data pooling from the six patients showed significant acetylation changes in 187 gene loci at different chromosomal regions including promoters, coding exons, introns and distal intergenic regions. Signaling pathway analysis showed that H3K9 acetylation changes are linked to AML-relevant signaling pathways like EGF/EGFR and Wnt/Hedgehog/Notch. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify the nucleoside analogs DHAs as activators of SIRT6. Our findings provide a rationale against the combination of the nucleoside analogs DHAs with SIRT6 inhibitors or chemotherapeutic agents in AML due to the role of SIRT6 in maintaining genome integrity and DNA repair.",,"['Carraway, Hetty E', 'Malkaram, Sridhar A', 'Cen, Yana', 'Shatnawi, Aymen', 'Fan, Jun', 'Ali, Hamdy E A', 'Abd Elmageed, Zakaria Y', 'Buttolph, Thomm', 'Denvir, James', 'Primerano, Donald A', 'Fandy, Tamer E']","['Carraway HE', 'Malkaram SA', 'Cen Y', 'Shatnawi A', 'Fan J', 'Ali HEA', 'Abd Elmageed ZY', 'Buttolph T', 'Denvir J', 'Primerano DA', 'Fandy TE']","['Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biology, West Virginia State University, Institute, WV, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albany College of Pharmacy, Colchester, VT, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 23219, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical & Administrative Sciences, University of Charleston, Charleston, WV, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Marshall University, Huntington, WV, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Texas A&M University, Kingsville, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Texas A&M University, Kingsville, TX, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Marshall University, Huntington, WV, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Marshall University, Huntington, WV, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical & Administrative Sciences, University of Charleston, Charleston, WV, USA. tamerfandy@ucwv.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200625,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC7316973,,,,2020/06/27 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-67170-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-67170-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jun 25;10(1):10325. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-67170-8.,"['P20 GM103434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",1,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6436-5744', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4031-0348', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2175-4472']",20201221,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Histones)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Sirtuins/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2020 Sep 22;10(1):15386.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), NTAL depletion from lipid rafts decreases cell viability through regulation of the Akt/PI3K pathway. The role of NTAL in APL cell processes, and its association with clinical outcome, has not, however, been established. Here, we show that reduced levels of NTAL were associated with increased all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation, generation of reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, NTAL-knockdown (NTAL-KD) in APL cell lines led to activation of Ras, inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathways, and increased expression of autophagy markers, leading to an increased apoptosis rate following arsenic trioxide treatment. Furthermore, NTAL-KD in NB4 cells decreased the tumor burden in (NOD scid gamma) NSG mice, suggesting its implication in tumor growth. A retrospective analysis of NTAL expression in a cohort of patients treated with ATRA and anthracyclines, revealed that NTAL overexpression was associated with a high leukocyte count (P = 0.007) and was independently associated with shorter overall survival (Hazard Ratio: 3.6; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.17-11.28; P = 0.026).

In the absence of beta-catenin, Tcfs and Lef1 generally act as transcriptional repressors with co-repressor proteins such as Groucho, CtBP, and HIC-5. However, Tcfs and Lef1 turn into transcriptional activators during the interaction with beta-catenin. Therefore, the activity of Tcfs and Lef1 is regulated by beta-catenin. However, the intrinsic role of Tcfs and Lef1 has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Tcfs and Lef1 play differential roles in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of mouse ES cells. Methods and Results: Interestingly, the expression of Tcfs and Lef1 was dynamically altered under various differentiation conditions, such as removal of LIF, EB formation and neuronal differentiation in N2B27 media, suggesting that the function of each Tcf and Lef1 may vary in ES cells. Ectopic expression of Tcf1 or the dominant negative form of Lef1 (Lef1-DN) contributes to ES cells to self-renew in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), whereas ectopic expression of Tcf3, Lef1 or Tcf1-DN did not support ES cells to self-renew. Ectopic expression of either Lef1 or Lef1-DN blocked neuronal differentiation, suggesting that the transient induction of Lef1 was necessary for the initiation and progress of differentiation. ChIP analysis shows that Tcf1 bound to Nanog promoter and ectopic expression of Tcf1 enhanced the transcription of Nanog. Conclusions: The overall data suggest that Tcf1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of stemness whereas Lef1 is involved in the initiation of differentiation.",,"['Kim, Sewoon', 'Kim, Hanjun', 'Tan, Anderson', 'Song, Yonghee', 'Lee, Hyeju', 'Ying, Qi-Long', 'Jho, Eek-Hoon']","['Kim S', 'Kim H', 'Tan A', 'Song Y', 'Lee H', 'Ying QL', 'Jho EH']","['Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Int J Stem Cells,International journal of stem cells,101497587,PMC7378906,['NOTNLM'],"['Differentiation', 'ES cell', 'Self-renewal', 'Tcf/Lef1', 'Wnt']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:01,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:01 [medline]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['ijsc20044 [pii]', '10.15283/ijsc20044 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Stem Cells. 2020 Jul 30;13(2):192-201. doi: 10.15283/ijsc20044.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ubiquitination-triggered proteasomal degradation of DNA-bound NF-kB strongly limits the expression of its target genes. Conversely, USP7 (deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7) opposes the activities of E3 ligases, stabilizes DNA-bound NF-kB, and thereby promotes NF-kB-mediated transcription. Using gene expression and synthetic peptide arrays on membrane support and overlay analyses, we found here that inhibiting USP7 increases NF-kB ubiquitination and degradation, prevents Toll-like receptor-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and represents an effective strategy for controlling inflammation. However, the broad regulatory roles of USP7 in cell death pathways, chromatin, and DNA damage responses limit the use of catalytic inhibitors of USP7 as anti-inflammatory agents. To this end, we identified an NF-kB-binding site in USP7, ubiquitin-like domain 2, that selectively mediates interactions of USP7 with NF-kB subunits but is dispensable for interactions with other proteins. Moreover, we found that the amino acids (757)LDEL(760) in USP7 critically contribute to the interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-kB. Our findings support the notion that USP7 activity could be potentially targeted in a substrate-selective manner through the development of noncatalytic inhibitors of this deubiquitinase to abrogate NF-kB activity.",['(c) 2020 Mitxitorena et al.'],"['Mitxitorena, Izaskun', 'Somma, Domenico', 'Mitchell, Jennifer P', 'Lepisto, Matti', 'Tyrchan, Christian', 'Smith, Emma L', 'Kiely, Patrick A', 'Walden, Helen', 'Keeshan, Karen', 'Carmody, Ruaidhri J']","['Mitxitorena I', 'Somma D', 'Mitchell JP', 'Lepisto M', 'Tyrchan C', 'Smith EL', 'Kiely PA', 'Walden H', 'Keeshan K', 'Carmody RJ']","['GLAZgo Discovery Centre, Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis Pathogenesis Centre of Excellence, Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Innovative Medicines and Early Development, Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity, AstraZeneca AB, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Innovative Medicines and Early Development, Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity, AstraZeneca AB, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Graduate Entry Medical School, Health Research Institute and Bernal Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."", 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom ruaidhri.carmody@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200625,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC7450122,['NOTNLM'],"['*NF-kappa B (NF-kB)', '*Toll-like receptor', '*deubiquitinase', '*deubiquitylation (deubiquitination)', '*gene regulation', '*inflammation', '*innate immunity', '*protein-protein interaction', '*transcription factor', '*ubiquitin-like domain', '*ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7)', '*ubiquitylation (ubiquitination)']","['Conflict of interest-The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest', 'with the contents of this article.']",2020/06/27 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(17)48473-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA120.014113 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2020 Aug 14;295(33):11754-11763. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA120.014113.

We report on the case of a successful ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation with high titers after bone marrow transplantation experienced no infectious episodes. The patient was a 38-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease resulting from interstitial nephritis induced by drug toxicity or graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). He had received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen-identical unrelated donor to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. The patient with high anti-B antibody titers (IgM 1:1024 IgG 1:256) received a desensitization protocol consisting of 2 doses of rituximab and 5 courses of plasmapheresis. The patient had prolonged depletion of circulating B cells 2 years after the transplant and was infected with cytomegalovirus viremia, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and adenovirus urinary tract infection at 2, 3, and 17 months post-transplant, respectively. Currently, at 6 years after his transplant, the patient has had no rejection and is in good clinical condition with only mild renal insuf fi ciency. Our results suggest that ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation may be an effective renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease after HSCT, but desensitization in combination with immunosuppressants could lead to a state of over-immunosuppression, causing various infections.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

We show that VISTA deficiency protects from crescentic glomerulonephritis, with no effect on the nephritogenic adaptive immune response. The early neutrophil influx was unaffected but proteinuria was reduced suggesting a reduction in neutrophil activation. In vivo, there was reduced neutrophil degranulation in VISTA deficienct mice and, in vitro, VISTA-deficient neutrophils had an impaired response to immune complexes but not to fMLP or PMA. Mice with a genetic deficiency of neutrophils due to myeloid-specific deletion of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) were also protected from crescentic glomerulonephritis, indicating an essential role for neutrophils. Therefore, VISTA deficiency inhibits neutrophil activation by immune complexes and neutrophil-dependent crescentic glomerulonephritis.

The resistance to conventional therapy of this disease is, at least in part, attributed to its cancer stem cell population. However, the mechanism of survival and stemness maintenance of cancer stem cells remains to be investigated. METHODS: Tumorsphere formation assay was used to study the stem-like property of melanoma stem-like cells (MSLC). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), promoter luciferase reporter assay were included for exploring the role of MCL-1 in MSLC and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to evaluate the interaction between shrimp miR-965 and human Ago2 protein. Melanoma xenograft nude mice were used to study the inhibition of tumor development. RESULTS: In the present study, our results showed that myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) knocking down induced ER stress and apoptosis, and the expression reduction of stemness associated genes in MSLC, which implied a significant role of MCL-1 in MSLC. Further study indicated that ER stress agonist (tunicamycin) treatment in MSLC results in the translocation of XBP1, an ER stress sensor, into the nucleus to induce MCL-1 expression through direct binding to the - 313- to - 308-bp region of MCL-1 promoter. In addition, we found that a shrimp-derived miRNA (shrimp miR-965) could interact with the human Ago2 protein and suppressed the human MCL-1 expression by binding to the 3' UTR of MCL-1 mRNA, thereby inhibiting the MSLC proliferation and stemness in vitro and in vivo in a cross-species manner. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we identified an important role of MCL-1-ER stress-XBP1 feedback loop in the stemness and survival maintenance of MSLC, and shrimp miR-965, a natural food derived miRNA, could regulate MSLC stemness and survival by targeting MCL-1 and disrupting the balance of MCL-1-ER stress-XBP1 feedback loop. In conclusion, this study indicated an important mechanism of the regulation of MSLC stemness and survival, otherwise it also demonstrated the significance of cross-species-derived miRNA as promising natural drugs in melanoma therapy.",,"['Wu, Wenlin', 'Xu, Chenxi', 'Zhang, Xiaobo', 'Yu, An', 'Shu, Le']","['Wu W', 'Xu C', 'Zhang X', 'Yu A', 'Shu L']","[""College of Oceanology and Food Science, Quanzhou Normal University, Quanzhou, 36200, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", 'Huffington Centre on Aging, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ""College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. leshu@zju.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200625,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,PMC7318764,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cross-species gene expression regulation', '*Melanoma stem-like cells', '*Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1)', '*Shrimp miR-965', '*X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1)']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-020-01734-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-020-01734-3 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2020 Jun 25;11(1):248. doi: 10.1186/s13287-020-01734-3.,,1,,20210618,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Melanoma/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel-group, triple-blind, phase 2-3 randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients over the age of 15 from 5 types of cancer are included in the study. Patients with acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias in the first line treated with curative intent, patients with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with leukemia protocols and patients with non-metastatic breast and colon cancer in the first line of treatment will enter the study. The exclusion criteria will include known sensitivity to Hydroxychloroquine, weight below 35 kilograms, history of retinopathy, history of any cardiac disease, acute respiratory tract infection in the last 2 months, having COVID-19 in the first two weeks of entering the trial, having Diabetes Mellitus, having an immuno-suppressive disease other than cancer, having chronic pulmonary disease and taking immuno-suppressant drug other than chemotherapeutic agents for current cancer. This study is performed in five academic centres affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients are randomly assigned to two groups; one being given hydroxychloroquine and the other is given placebo. During two months of treatment, the two groups are treated with either hydroxychloroquine (Amin(R) Pharmaceutical Company, Isfahan, Iran) or placebo (identical in terms of shape, colour, smell) as a single 200 mg tablet every other day. Patients will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms during the follow-up period. If signs or symptoms occur (fever, cough, shortness of breath), they will be examined and investigated with a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, COVID-19 specific IgM, IgG antibody assay and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point of this study is to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in patients being treated for their cancer over a 2-month period. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be performed using randomly permuted blocks. By using an online website (www.randomization.com) the randomization sequence will be produced by quadruple blocks. The allocation ratio in intervention and control groups is 1:1. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants and caregivers do not know whether the patient is in the intervention or the control group. The outcome assessor and the data analyst are also blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The calculated total sample size is 60 patients, with 30 patients in each group. TRIAL STATUS: The trial began on April 14, 2020 and recruitment is ongoing. Recruitment is anticipated to be completed by June 14, 2020 There has been no change in study protocol since approval, protocol version 1 was approved April 12, 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered by the title of ""Effect of Hydroxychloroquine on Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) prevention in cancer patients under treatment"" in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) with code ""IRCT20200405046958N1"", https://www.irct.ir/trial/46946.

The precise role of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) in T-ALL has been controversial since both overexpression and inactivating LEF1 mutations have been reported to date. Here, we investigate the potential gene targets of LEF1 in the Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cell line. Materials and Methods: We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to knock down LEF1 in Jurkat cells and then compared the gene expression levels in the LEF1 knockdown cells with non-targeting siRNA-transfected and non-transfected cells by employing microarray analysis. Results: We identified DHRS2, a tumor suppressor gene, as the most significantly downregulated gene in LEF1 knockdown cells, and we further confirmed its downregulation by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in mRNA and at protein level by western blotting. Conclusion: Our results revealed that DHRS2 is positively regulated by LEF1 in Jurkat cells, which indicates the capability of LEF1 as a tumor suppressor and, together with previous reports, suggests that LEF1 exhibits a regulatory role in T-ALL via not only its oncogenic targets but also tumor suppressor genes.",,"['Sirma Ekmekci, Sema', 'Emrence, Zeliha', 'Abaci, Neslihan', 'Sariman, Melda', 'Salman, Burcu', 'Ekmekci, Cumhur Gokhan', 'Gulec, Cagri']","['Sirma Ekmekci S', 'Emrence Z', 'Abaci N', 'Sariman M', 'Salman B', 'Ekmekci CG', 'Gulec C']","['Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200626,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,PMC7702649,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*p53', '*DHRS2', '*LEF1', '*siRNA']",,2020/06/27 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/06/27 06:00'],"['2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2020.0144 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2020 Nov 19;37(4):226-233. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2020.0144.

Skeletal muscle encompasses one of the major organs of the body (constituting about 40% of the body mass in non-obese men). It regulates energy and metabolic processes and is now recognized as an organ capable of producing molecules with vital functions. These molecules are termed myokines, a new field of research in the health sciences, and represent an open field of discoveries and applications in several areas. The aim of this review was to show the role of some well-known myokines in the maintenance of homeostasis. Our search was performed in databases such as Medline/Pubmed, Embase and Scielo. Some relevant myokines are interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-15, irisin, myostatin, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). They are related to play a positive or negative role in muscle function and metabolism homeostasis. They are associated with the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, the deposition of fat in the adipose tissue, and the ""browning"" of the white adipose tissue. For these reasons, they can interfere with the prevention of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases.

The CT/TT variants of rs1449683 show a tendency towards the development of the disease and the same variants associated significantly with higher genetic risk and with reduced disease free survival. Moreover, the association persisted in the early-stage disease subgroup.

Currently, a number of small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway have been assessed in preclinical and clinical studies. It has been found that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancers, but the mechanism is still being explored. Therefore, determining the role of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors PKI-402 in cancer cells may facilitate overcoming chemoresistance. By referring to a gene database and screening gene sequences, we found that human ovarian cancer epithelial cell lines SKOV3 and A2780 had mutations of the PIK3CA gene, which might be relatively sensitive to dual-targeted PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. In this study, our data indicated that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PKI-402 disrupted the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins by degrading the Mcl-1 protein through autophagy. Moreover, the autophagy receptor protein p62 bound to Mcl-1 through its ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA domain) to participate in the degradation of Mcl-1 through autophagy.

A better understanding of the biological characteristics of HZ patients can help develop new targeted therapies to improve the prognosis. High-throughput proteomics technology can deeply study the molecular changes in the development and progression of HZ disease and integrate different levels of information, this is important to help make clinical decisions. Circulating blood contains a lot of biological information, we conducted a proteomics study of patient plasma, hoping to identify key proteins that could indicate the development of HZ. Compared to healthy human plasma, we found 44 differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of HZ patients, the main pathways involved in these molecules are MAPK signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Acute myeloid leukemia, Transcriptional misregulation in cancer. We found that 27 proteins have direct protein-protein interactions. Based on the comprehensive score, we identified six key molecules as candidate molecules for further study, and then validated another 80 plasma samples (40 HZ patient plasma and 40 healthy human plasma) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot assay and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Finally, we found that the expression levels of these three proteins (PLG, F2, VTN) were significantly lower than those of healthy controls (P < .05). To the best of our knowledge, we first used tandem mass tag (TMT) combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to screen for differentially expressed proteins in plasma between HZ patients and healthy individuals. It is preliminarily proved that the plasma protein expression profile of HZ patients is different from that of uninfected patients, it has also been found that these three altered key proteins may be used as biomarkers to test early HZ infection. This study reveals new insights into HZ that help to more accurately identify early HZ patients and to find new therapeutic targets. SIGNIFICANCE: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV; termed human alphaherpesvirus 3 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) is a herpesvirus that is ubiquitous in humans and can cause chickenpox and herpes zoster (HZ). After the initial infection of varicella, the VZV goes into a dormant state in the sensory ganglia and cranial nerves. As age or immunosuppression increases, the cellular immunity to VZV decreases, and the virus reactivates and spreads along the sensory nerves to the skin, causing a unique prodromal pain followed by a rash. About one in five people around the world may be infected with VZV at some point in their lives. According to statistics, about one-third of infected people will develop HZ in their lifetime, and an estimated 1 million cases of herpes zoster occur in the United States each year. Herpes zoster can occur at any age and is usually less severe in children and young adults, but the greatest morbidity and mortality are observed in elderly and immunocompromised patients. 20% of patients with HZ have complications including vasculitis, increased risk of myocardial infarction, or postherpetic neuralgia, the overall mortality rate of patients with HZ in the United States is close to 5%. Considering the wide clinical severity and complications of this disease, there is a great need for biomarkers that contribute to early diagnosis, classification of risks, and prediction of outcomes, which will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying their clinical development. As a useful tool in biology, quantitative proteomics can repeatedly identify and accurately quantify proteins in a variety of biological samples. Proteomic analysis focuses on translational proteins, which play a direct role in most biological processes. Although a small number of proteins can be studied simultaneously with traditional methods, such as ELISA and Western blotting, typical proteomics studies can simultaneously analyze thousands of proteins for a more comprehensive identification. Proteomics has been successfully applied to human-based disease research, Analysis of exposed and unexposed subjects based on mass spectrometry (MS) has been found to reveal altered expression of proteins that can be identified as intermediate biomarkers of early disease effects. Tandem mass tags (TMTs) are chemical labels used for MS-based identification and quantification of biological molecules. TMTs play an important role in proteomic analysis in a variety of samples such as cells, tissues, and body fluids. The body fluids that are often detected clinically are blood, which are easy to obtain and contain abundant biological information related to physiological and pathological processes, we hope to develop protein biomarkers from these blood. Therefore, in order to better characterize the pathological process of HZ patients, we performed proteomic analysis of HZ patients and healthy human plasma using the TMT method. This comparison aims to identify specific processes in the development of HZ disease through protein profiling, which may help to improve our biological understanding of HZ.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Moreover, PML-RARalpha fusion gene testing is an essential tool for monitoring the response to therapy via minimal residual disease and providing a diagnosis before rapid disease progression in APL. The present study developed a novel droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to rapidly detect two PML-RARalpha variants (bcr1 and bcr3) and compared its limit of detection (LOD) with quantitative PCR (qPCR). It was demonstrated that the LOD of ddPCR for PML-RARalpha reached 0.001%, and the evaluation of high copy number samples of PML-RARalpha by ddPCR correlated well with qPCR. Furthermore, clinical sample testing with ddPCR found that 34 and 24% samples were bcr-1-positive and bcr3-positive, respectively. However, according to qPCR, 30% of the samples were bcr1-positive and 20% were bcr3-positive. In addition, the concordance rate between ddPCR and qPCR reaction was 86%. While monitoring minimal residual disease, the PML-RARalpha mutation rate of three patients who recovered well decreased to 0.34%. However, one patient who was bcr3-positive and relapsed had a mutation rate of 13% while in remission, indicating that the bcr3 isoform may be an adverse prognostic factor affecting recovery. Therefore, the present results suggested that this novel ddPCR assay may be useful for monitoring and evaluating the treatment effects and prognosis of APL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant time is devoted to care coordination (""nonbillable"" time), but the scope, time per patient, and ratio of nonbillable to billable (NB:B) minutes are unknown. This information is crucial to designing new PPO outpatient clinics and advocating for appropriate personnel, physician time, and resources. Our objectives were to quantify nonbillable time and evaluate demographic or disease-based associations. Methods: A single-institution one-day PPO clinic was started in July 2017. All encounters were tracked for 11 months. Administrative and PPO inpatient time were excluded. Billable and nonbillable minutes were recorded daily. Ratios of NB:B minutes by patient demographics and clinical factors were calculated using descriptive statistics and multivariate modeling. Results: Ninety-five patients were included [solid tumors (42, 44%), brain tumors (33, 35%), and leukemia/lymphoma (20, 21%)]. PPO completed billable visits on 52 of 95 (55%) patients and assisted without billing in the care of 43 patients (45%). Twenty-four (25%) patients were deceased. Overall NB:B ratio was 1.04 and differed among diagnoses (leukemia/lymphoma 2.5, solid tumor 0.9, and brain tumor 0.8). Deceased patients had a higher ratio of NB:B minutes than alive patients (1.9 vs. 0.8, p = 0.012). Billable and nonbillable minutes both increased over time. Conclusions: Care coordination in a PPO clinic is time intensive and grows with clinic volume. When devising a PPO outpatient program, this NB:B ratio should be accounted for in clinician time and personnel devoted to patient and family assistance.",,"['Brock, Katharine E', 'DeGroote, Nicholas P', 'Allen, Kristen E']","['Brock KE', 'DeGroote NP', 'Allen KE']","['Divisions of Hematology/Oncology and Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Divisions of Palliative Care, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200623,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,['NOTNLM'],"['*billing', '*cancer', '*care coordination', '*outpatient', '*pediatric palliative care', '*pediatric palliative oncology']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jpm.2020.0197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2021 Mar;24(3):413-417. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2020.0197.

For instance, aberrant PPIs involving the Bcl-2 protein family can lead to several diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Interactions between Bcl-2 pro-life proteins, such as Mcl-1, and pro-death proteins, such as Bim, regulate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. p53, a tumor-suppressor protein, also has a pivotal role in apoptosis and is negatively regulated by its E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2. Both Mcl-1 and HDM2 are upregulated in numerous cancers, and, interestingly, there is crosstalk between both protein pathways. Recently, synergy has been observed between Mcl-1 and HDM2 inhibitors. Towards the development of new anticancer drugs, we herein describe a polypharmacology approach for the dual inhibition of Mcl-1 and HDM2 by employing three densely functionalized isoxazoles, pyrazoles, and thiazoles as mimetics of key alpha-helical domains of their partner proteins.","['(c) 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In subgroup of patients with non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, intravenous arsenic trioxide plus all-trans-retinoic acid is considered the preferred regimen for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Recently, there are interests in the use of the oral form of arsenic, named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula, but the data on its efficacy and safety are still relatively limited. The current study was conducted with the aims to identify and summarize the results of all available randomized-controlled studies. A systematic review was conducted in the 2 major databases, utilizing the terms for arsenic and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Eligible studies had to be randomized-controlled studies that compared efficacy and/or adverse effects of oral arsenic versus intravenous arsenic for treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool the effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the included studies together. A total of 4 randomized controlled studies with 482 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (258 in Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula group and 224 in intravenous arsenic trioxide group) were included in the meta-analysis. The chances of achieving complete remission were numerically higher in the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula group but the difference was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio: 4.59, 95% CI: 0.74-28.57, I (2) = 0%).

However, the effects of IGFIR on the malignant characteristics of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) clonal cells remains to be determined. In the present study it was demonstrated that knockdown of IGFIR reduced the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of MDS/leukemia cells. Integrated analysis of gene expression profiles using bioinformatics identified the MAPK signaling pathway as a critical downstream factor of IGFIR, and this was confirmed in vitro using western blotting which revealed that IGFIR knockdown significantly increased the expression of activated MAPK. Furthermore, IGFIR signaling was inhibited to investigate the potential of IGFIR as a therapeutic target of MDS. The results revealed that the IGFIR inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) inhibited cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in MDS/leukemia cells. Similar to the effects of IGFIR knockdown, PPP treatment also increased MAPK signaling in vitro.

In this ""How I Treat"" article, we focus on key questions that arise during 3 phases of management for patients receiving CD19-targeted CAR-T cells: pre CAR-T-cell infusion, immediate post CAR-T-cell infusion, and long-term follow-up. A longitudinal patient case is presented for each phase to highlight fundamental issues including infectious diseases screening, antimicrobial prophylaxis, immunoglobulin supplementation, risk factors for infection, and vaccination.

These epigenetic changes have been associated with the development of cancer. Previous research has found that DNA methylation patterns can predict disease prognosis for patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). The role of DNMT1 and CDH1 in regulating the extension of cells are studied in this study. Methods: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of APL patients and treated with bisulfite. DNMT1 and CDH1 gene promoter methylation was subsequently analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Real-time PCR was used to measure the expression level of DNMT1 and CDH1 genes. Results: Partial methylation of the CDH1 gene promoter was detected in 20% of APL patients and an unmethylated status was detected in 80% of patient samples. Additionally, an unmethylated status in the DNMT1 gene promoter was detected in 100% of APL patient samples. Conclusion: Our study found the CDH1 gene promoter to be unmethylated in almost all APL patients, while the DNMT1 promoter was unmethylated in all APL patients. Furthermore, we observed an increase in both CDH1 and DNMT1 gene expression in APL patients compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that DNMT1 may not have a specific role in inhibiting CDH1 gene expression in APL. Applying higher resolution techniques would help to better uncover the DNA methylation patterns in patients with APL.

Here, we quantified gene expression of several BLV-related genes: effector protein of T and NK-killer cells NK-lysin (Nklys), reverse BLV transcriptase pol, BLV receptor (blvr), and also key enzymes of the microRNA maturation, Dicer (dc1) and Argonaut (ago2). The differences in the expression of the above genes were compared between five groups: (1) BLV infected cows with high and (2) low lymphocyte count, (3) with and (4) without BLV microRNA expressions, and (5) cows without BLV infections (control group). As compared to control, infected cows with high lymphocyte count and BLV microRNA expression had significantly decreased Nklys gene expression and increased dc1 and ago2 gene expressions. Few infected animals without pol gene expression nevertheless transcribed BLV microRNA, while others with pol gene expression didn't transcribe BLV microRNA. Notably, Pol expression significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with dc1 expression. For infected animals, there were no direct correlations between the number of leukocytes and pol, Nklys, and BLV microRNA gene expressions. Blvr gene expression is typical for juvenile lymphocytes and decreases during terminal differentiation. Our data suggest that BLV infects primarily juvenile lymphocytes, which further divide into two groups. One group expresses BLV DNA and another one expressed BLV microRNA that decreases host immune response against cells, expressing BLV proteins. It is suspected that regulatory microRNAs play a significant role in the bovine leukemia infections, yet the precise mechanisms and targets of the microRNAs remain poorly defined. Vaccines that are currently in use have a low response rate. Understanding of microRNA regulatory mechanisms and targets would allow to develop more effective vaccines for retroviral infections.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Kosovsky, Glazko, Glazko, Zybaylov and Glazko.']","['Kosovsky, Gleb Yu', 'Glazko, Valery I', 'Glazko, Galina V', 'Zybaylov, Boris L', 'Glazko, Tatiana T']","['Kosovsky GY', 'Glazko VI', 'Glazko GV', 'Zybaylov BL', 'Glazko TT']","['FSBEI HPE Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, Moscow, Russia.', 'FSBEI HPE Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, Moscow, Russia.', 'FSBSI V.A.

Some minor H antigens can be used as therapeutic T cell targets to augment the graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect in order to prevent or manage leukemia relapse after HCT. Graft engineering and post-HCT immunotherapies are being developed to optimize delivery of T cells specific for selected minor H antigens. These strategies have the potential to reduce relapse risk and thereby permit implementation of HCT approaches that are associated with less toxicity and fewer late effects, which is particularly important in the growing and developing pediatric patient. Most minor H antigens are expressed ubiquitously, including on epithelial tissues, and can be recognized by donor T cells following HCT, leading to graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) as well as GVL. However, those minor H antigens that are expressed predominantly on hematopoietic cells can be targeted for selective GVL. Once full donor hematopoietic chimerism is achieved after HCT, hematopoietic-restricted minor H antigens are present only on residual recipient malignant hematopoietic cells, and these minor H antigens serve as tumor-specific antigens for donor T cells. Minor H antigen-specific T cells that are delivered as part of the donor hematopoietic stem cell graft at the time of HCT contribute to relapse prevention. However, in some cases the minor H antigen-specific T cells delivered with the graft may be quantitatively insufficient or become functionally impaired over time, leading to leukemia relapse. Following HCT, adoptive T cell immunotherapy can be used to treat or prevent relapse by delivering large numbers of donor T cells targeting hematopoietic-restricted minor H antigens. In this review, we discuss minor H antigens as T cell targets for augmenting the GVL effect in engineered HCT grafts and for post-HCT immunotherapy. We will highlight the importance of these developments for pediatric HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Summers, Sheth and Bleakley.']","['Summers, Corinne', 'Sheth, Vipul S', 'Bleakley, Marie']","['Summers C', 'Sheth VS', 'Bleakley M']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200603,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC7283489,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell immunotherapy', 'graft engineering', 'graft-vs.-leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia', 'minor histocompatibility antigen', 'pediatric', 'polymorphism']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2020/06/26 06:01,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2020.00284 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2020 Jun 3;8:284. doi: 10.3389/fped.2020.00284. eCollection 2020.,['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-seven percent of the patients were ethnic or racial minorities. Thirteen patients had B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with 10 receiving 1,200 cGy fractionated total body irradiation with fludarabine while the remaining 11 patients had targeted dose-busulfan, fludarabine, melphalan conditioning. Graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (15 patients) or cyclophosphamide and bendamustine (six patients), with all patients receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Twelve patients were in first or second remission at time of transplant with five in >2nd remission and four with measurable disease. Three patients had failed prior transplants and three CAR-T cell therapies. Only one patient developed primary graft failure but engrafted promptly after a second conditioned T-replete peripheral blood stem cell transplant from the same donor. An absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L was achieved at a median time of 16 days post-BMT while platelet engraftment occurred at a median of 30 days. The cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD was 15.2 and 18.1%, respectively.

Therefore, treatment-free remission (TFR), through the achievement of a DMR, is increasingly regarded as a feasible treatment goal in many CML patients.

Since epigenetic dysregulations, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, as well as chromatin remodeling, are a frequent occurrence in AML, an increasing and selective number of epi-drugs are emerging as encouraging therapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate that the histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) JMJD3/UTX inhibitor GSKJ4 results in both proliferation decrease and CREB protein downregulation in AML cells. We found that GSKJ4 clearly decreases CREB protein, but not CREB mRNA levels. By cycloheximide assay, we provide evidence that GSKJ4 reduces CREB protein stability; moreover, proteasome inhibition largely counteracts the GSKJ4-induced CREB downregulation. Very interestingly, a rapid CREB phosphorylation at the Ser133 residue precedes CREB protein decrease in response to GSKJ4 treatment. In addition, protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibition, almost completely prevents both GSKJ4-induced p-Ser133-CREB phosphorylation and CREB protein downregulation. Overall, our study enforces the evidence regarding CREB as a potential druggable target, identifies the small epigenetic molecule GSKJ4 as an ""inhibitor"" of CREB, and encourages the design of future GSKJ4-based studies for the development of innovative approaches for AML therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Illiano, Conte, Salzillo, Ragone, Spina, Nebbioso, Altucci,', 'Sapio and Naviglio.']","['Illiano, Michela', 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'Salzillo, Alessia', 'Ragone, Angela', 'Spina, Annamaria', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Sapio, Luigi', 'Naviglio, Silvio']","['Illiano M', 'Conte M', 'Salzillo A', 'Ragone A', 'Spina A', 'Nebbioso A', 'Altucci L', 'Sapio L', 'Naviglio S']","['Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200605,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7289982,['NOTNLM'],"['GSKJ4', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) downregulation', 'proteasome-mediated degradation', 'protein kinase A (PKA)']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2020/06/26 06:01,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00799 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 5;10:799. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00799. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However routine curative treatment remains restricted to a small number of malignancies including acute leukemia, high grade lymphoma, germ cell tumors, gestational malignancies and some of the rare childhood cancers. The detailed explanation for this dramatic divergence in outcomes remains to be elucidated. However, we have previously argued that there is a strong correlation between presence of the unique genetic events of immunoglobulin gene variable/diversity/joining (VDJ) recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM), meiosis, nuclear fusion and gastrulation occurring in cells of origin of these malignancies and their high sensitivity to DNA damaging chemotherapy. In this study we have reviewed some of the basic physiological information relating to the specialized activity and sensitivity to DNA damage mediated apoptosis of normal cells undergoing these processes. In each of unique genetic events there are dramatic changes in apoptotic sensitivity. In VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation over 95% of the cells involved undergo apoptosis, whilst in meiosis and nuclear fusion there are dramatic short term increases in the apoptotic sensitivity to DNA damage. It is apparent that each of the malignancies arising during these processes retains some of the unique phenotype associated with it. The impact of the physiological differences is most clearly seen in the two non-mutational malignancies. Gestational choriocarcinoma which arises shortly after nuclear fusion is routinely curable with chemotherapy whilst CIMP-positive ependymomas which is not linked to any of the unique genetic events is highly resistant. A similar pattern is found in a pair of malignancies driven by a single driver mutation. Infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arises in a cell undergoing the early stages of VDJ recombination and has a 40% cure rate in contrast pediatric rhabdoid malignancy which is not linked to a unique genetic event responds very poorly to chemotherapy treatment. The physiological changes occurring in cancer cells at the time of the malignant transformation appear to have a major impact on the subsequent sensitivity to chemotherapy and curability.

Therefore, a substantial unmet need exists to treat patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. The use of novel agents such as daratumumab, elotuzumab, carfilzomib, or pomalidomide, among others, usually cannot completely eradicate myeloma cells. Although these new drugs have had a significant impact on the prognosis of MM patients, the vast majority ultimately become refractory or can no longer be treated due to toxicity of prior treatment, and thus succumb to the disease. Cellular therapies represent a novel approach with a unique mechanism of action against myeloma with the potential to defeat drug resistance and achieve long-term remissions. Genetic modification of cells to express a novel receptor with tumor antigen specificity is currently being explored in myeloma. Chimeric antigen receptor gene-modified T-cells (CAR T-cells) have shown to be the most promising approach so far. CAR T-cells have shown to induce durable complete remissions in other advanced hematologic malignancies like acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). With this background, significant efforts are underway to develop CAR-based therapies for MM. Currently, several antigen targets, including CD138, CD19, immunoglobulin kappa (Ig-Kappa) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), are being used in clinical trials to treat myeloma patients. Some of these trials have shown promising results, especially in terms of response rates. However, the absence of a plateau is observed in most studies which correlates with the absence of durable remissions. Therefore, several potential limitations such as lack of effectiveness, off-tumor toxicities, and antigen loss or interference with soluble proteins could hamper the efficacy of CAR T-cells in myeloma. In this review, we will focus on clinical outcomes reported with CAR T-cells in myeloma, as well as on CAR T-cell limitations and how to overcome them with next generation of CAR T-cells.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Garcia-Guerrero, Sierro-Martinez and Perez-Simon.']","['Garcia-Guerrero, Estefania', 'Sierro-Martinez, Belen', 'Perez-Simon, Jose Antonio']","['Garcia-Guerrero E', 'Sierro-Martinez B', 'Perez-Simon JA']","['Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, UGC de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, UGC de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, UGC de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200605,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7290012,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T-cell', '*allogeneic CAR T-cell', '*antigen escape', '*myeloma', '*soluble protein', '*toxicities']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01128 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jun 5;11:1128. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01128. eCollection 2020.,,,,20210402,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs and their metabolites impart unique properties in the interaction with each of the intracellular targets and metabolic enzymes whereby resulting in unique clinical activity. To date, most of the combinations have used a targeted agent combined with standard agents such as anthracyclines, cytarabine, or hypomethylating agents to improve the outcome. Rational combinations of DNA damage-inducing therapies with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors synergistically enhance the DNA damage, growth inhibition and apoptosis of myeloid cells.

It exerts a wide range of health-promoting effects. In addition to health-promoting effects, RSV possesses anti-carcinogenic activity. However, a non-physiological concentration is needed to achieve an anti-cancer effect, and its in vivo bioavailability is low. Therefore, the clinical application of phytochemicals requires alternative candidates that induce the desired effects at a lower concentration and with increased bioavailability. We previously reported a low IC50 of vaticanol C (VTC), an RSV tetramer, among 12 RSV derivatives (Ito T. et al, 2003). However, the precise mechanism involved remains to be determined. Here, we screened an in-house chemical library bearing RSV building blocks ranging from dimers to octamers for cytotoxic effects in several leukemia and cancer cell lines and their anti-cancer drug-resistant sublines. Among the compounds, VTC exhibited the highest cytotoxicity, which was partially inhibited by a caspase 3 inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. VTC decreased the expression of sphingosine kinase 1, sphingosine kinase 2 and glucosylceramide synthase by transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms, and increased cellular ceramides/dihydroceramides and decreased sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). VTC-induced sphingolipid rheostat modulation (the ratio of ceramide/S1P) is thought to be involved in cellular apoptosis. Indeed, exogenous S1P addition modulated VTC cytotoxicity significantly. A combination of SPHK1, SPHK2, and GCS chemical inhibitors induced sphingolipid rheostat modulation, cell growth suppression, and cytotoxicity similar to that of VTC. These results suggest the involvement of sphingolipid metabolism in VTC-induced cytotoxicity, and indicate VTC is a promising prototype for translational research.",,"['Inoue, Chisato', 'Sobue, Sayaka', 'Mizutani, Naoki', 'Kawamoto, Yoshiyuki', 'Nishizawa, Yuji', 'Ichihara, Masatoshi', 'Takeuchi, Toshiyuki', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Suzuki, Motoshi', 'Ito, Tetsuro', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Murate, Takashi']","['Inoue C', 'Sobue S', 'Mizutani N', 'Kawamoto Y', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Ichihara M', 'Takeuchi T', 'Hayakawa F', 'Suzuki M', 'Ito T', 'Nozawa Y', 'Murate T']","['College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Gifu Pharmaceutical University, Gifu, Japan.', 'Gifu Prefectural Research Institute for Health and Environmental Sciences, Kakamigahara, Japan.', 'Tokai Gakuin University, Kakamigahara, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Nagoya J Med Sci,Nagoya journal of medical science,0412011,PMC7276413,['NOTNLM'],"['GCS', 'SPHK', 'apoptosis', 'sphingolipid rheostat', 'vaticanol C']","['All authors disclose no actual or potential conflict of interest including any', 'financial, personal or other relationships with other people or organization.']",2020/06/26 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18999/nagjms.82.2.261 [doi]'],ppublish,Nagoya J Med Sci. 2020 May;82(2):261-280. doi: 10.18999/nagjms.82.2.261.,,2,,20210428,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (vaticanol C)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.91 (sphingosine kinase 2, human)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'PC-3 Cells', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the evidence, few data are available on the distribution of the pharmacogenomic variants relevant to the treatment of ALL in traditional Amerindian populations, such the those of the Amazon region. Given this, the present study investigated 27 molecular markers related to the treatment of ALL in Amerindians from Brazilian Amazonia and compared the frequencies with those recorded previously on five continents, that are available in the 1,000 Genomes database. The variation in the genotype frequencies among populations was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. The False Discovery Rate method was used to correct the results of the multiple analyses. Significant differences were found in the frequencies of the majority of markers between the Amerindian populations and those of other regions around the world.

Haematopoietic clones with acquired mutations become common with advancing age and can lead to blood cancers(1-10). Here we describe shared and population-specific patterns of genomic mutations and clonal selection in haematopoietic cells on the basis of 33,250 autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations that we detected in 179,417 Japanese participants in the BioBank Japan cohort and compared with analogous data from the UK Biobank. In this long-lived Japanese population, mosaic chromosomal alterations were detected in more than 35.0% (s.e.m., 1.4%) of individuals older than 90 years, which suggests that such clones trend towards inevitability with advancing age. Japanese and European individuals exhibited key differences in the genomic locations of mutations in their respective haematopoietic clones; these differences predicted the relative rates of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (which is more common among European individuals) and T cell leukaemia (which is more common among Japanese individuals) in these populations. Three different mutational precursors of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (including trisomy 12, loss of chromosomes 13q and 13q, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) were between two and six times less common among Japanese individuals, which suggests that the Japanese and European populations differ in selective pressures on clones long before the development of clinically apparent chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Japanese and British populations also exhibited very different rates of clones that arose from B and T cell lineages, which predicted the relative rates of B and T cell cancers in these populations.

Here, by using a genome-wide association study of 30,234 cases and 725,172 controls from Iceland and the UK Biobank, we find 99 sequence variants at 93 loci, of which 84 variants are previously unreported(2-7). A low-frequency (1.36%) intronic variant in FLT3 (rs76428106-C) has the largest effect on risk of autoimmune thyroid disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.46, P = 2.37 x 10(-24)). rs76428106-C is also associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 1.90, P = 6.46 x 10(-4)), rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP-positive rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 1.41, P = 4.31 x 10(-4)) and coeliac disease (OR = 1.62, P = 1.20 x 10(-4)). FLT3 encodes fms-related tyrosine kinase 3, a receptor that regulates haematopoietic progenitor and dendritic cells. RNA sequencing revealed that rs76428106-C generates a cryptic splice site, which introduces a stop codon in 30% of transcripts that are predicted to encode a truncated protein, which lacks its tyrosine kinase domains. Each copy of rs76428106-C doubles the plasma levels of the FTL3 ligand. Activating somatic mutations in FLT3 are associated with acute myeloid leukaemia(8) with a poor prognosis and rs76428106-C also predisposes individuals to acute myeloid leukaemia (OR = 1.90, P = 5.40 x 10(-3)). Thus, a predicted loss-of-function germline mutation in FLT3 causes a reduction in full-length FLT3, with a compensatory increase in the levels of its ligand and an increased disease risk, similar to that of a gain-of-function mutation.",,"['Saevarsdottir, Saedis', 'Olafsdottir, Thorunn A', 'Ivarsdottir, Erna V', 'Halldorsson, Gisli H', 'Gunnarsdottir, Kristbjorg', 'Sigurdsson, Asgeir',

The underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, data from pharmacogenomics studies and a panel of ALL cell lines reveal an inverse correlation between nelarabine sensitivity and the expression of SAMHD1, which can hydrolyse and inactivate triphosphorylated nucleoside analogues. Lower SAMHD1 abundance is detected in T-ALL than in B-ALL in cell lines and patient-derived leukaemic blasts. Mechanistically, T-ALL cells display increased SAMHD1 promoter methylation without increased global DNA methylation. SAMHD1 depletion sensitises B-ALL cells to AraG, while ectopic SAMHD1 expression in SAMHD1-null T-ALL cells induces AraG resistance. SAMHD1 has a larger impact on nelarabine/AraG than on cytarabine in ALL cells. Opposite effects are observed in acute myeloid leukaemia cells, indicating entity-specific differences.

In AML, a higher number of drivers worsens prognosis. The Shannon Index is a robust metric of clonal heterogeneity that accounts for the number of clones, but also their relative abundance. We show that a Shannon Index can be estimated from bulk sequencing, which is correlated (rho = 0.76) with clonal diversity from single-colony genotyping. In a discovery cohort of 292 patients with sequencing of 43 genes, a higher number of drivers (HR = 1.18, P = 0.028) and a lower Shannon Index (HR = 0.68, P = 0.048), the latter reflecting clonal dominance, are independently associated with worse OS independently of European LeukemiaNet 2017 risk. These findings are validated in an independent cohort of 1184 patients with 111-gene sequencing (number of drivers HR = 1.16, P = 1 x 10(-5), Shannon Index HR = 0.81, P = 0.007). By re-interrogating paired diagnosis/relapse exomes from 50 cytogenetically normal AMLs, we find clonal dominance at diagnosis to be correlated with the gain of a significantly higher number of mutations at relapse (P = 6 x 10(-6)), hence with clonal sweeping. Our results suggest that clonal dominance at diagnosis is associated with the presence of a leukemic phenotype allowing rapid expansion of new clones and driving relapse after chemotherapy.",,"['Cerrano, Marco', 'Duchmann, Matthieu', 'Kim, Rathana', 'Vasseur, Loic', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Quentin, Samuel', 'Pasanisi, Justine', 'Passet, Marie', 'Rabian,

Here, we show that interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 to recruit BCR-ABL1 and JAK kinases in close proximity. Treatment with BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors results in elevated expression of IL7R which enables the survival of transformed cells when IL7 was added together with the kinase inhibitors. Importantly, treatment with anti-IL7R antibodies prevents leukemia development in xenotransplantation models using patient-derived Ph(+) ALL cells. Our results suggest that the association between IL7R and CXCR4 serves as molecular platform for BCR-ABL1-induced transformation and development of Ph(+) ALL. Targeting this platform with anti-IL7R antibody eliminates Ph(+) ALL cells including those with resistance to commonly used ABL1 kinase inhibitors. Thus, anti-IL7R antibodies may provide alternative treatment options for ALL in general and may suppress incurable drug-resistant leukemia forms.",,"['Abdelrasoul, Hend', 'Vadakumchery, Anila',

Consistently, several studies have revealed that large cells have lower mass accumulation rates per unit mass (i.e., growth efficiency) than intermediate-sized cells in the same population. Size-dependent growth is commonly attributed to transport limitations, such as increased diffusion timescales and decreased surface-to-volume ratio. However, separating cell size- and cell cycle-dependent growth is challenging. To address this, we monitored growth efficiency of pseudodiploid mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells during normal proliferation and polyploidization. This was enabled by the development of large-channel suspended microchannel resonators that allow us to monitor buoyant mass of single cells ranging from 40 pg (small pseudodiploid cell) to over 4,000 pg, with a resolution ranging from approximately 1% to approximately 0.05%. We find that cell growth efficiency increases, plateaus, and then decreases as cell cycle proceeds. This growth behavior repeats with every endomitotic cycle as cells grow into polyploidy. Overall, growth efficiency changes 33% throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, increasing cell mass by over 100-fold during polyploidization did not change growth efficiency, indicating exponential growth.

It had been demonstrated by others and us that interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment of hepatocytes induced a prolonged suppression of human and duck hepatitis B virus cccDNA transcription, which is associated with the reduction of cccDNA-associated histone modifications specifying active transcription (H3K9(ac) or H3K27(ac)), but not the histone modifications marking constitutive (H3K9(me3)) or facultative (H3K27(me3)) heterochromatin formation. In our efforts to identify IFN-induced cellular proteins that mediate the suppression of cccDNA transcription by the cytokine, we found that downregulating the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1), or promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein increased basal level of cccDNA transcription activity and partially attenuated IFN-alpha suppression of cccDNA transcription. In contrast, ectopic expression of STAT1, SMCHD1, or PML significantly reduced cccDNA transcription activity. SMCHD1 is a noncanonical SMC family protein and implicated in epigenetic silencing of gene expression. PML is a component of nuclear domain 10 (ND10) and is involved in suppressing the replication of many DNA viruses. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that STAT1, SMCHD1, and PML were recruited to cccDNA minichromosomes and phenocopied the IFN-alpha-induced posttranslational modifications of cccDNA-associated histones. We thus conclude that STAT1, SMCHD1, and PML may partly mediate the suppressive effect of IFN-alpha on hepadnaviral cccDNA transcription.IMPORTANCE Pegylated IFN-alpha is the only therapeutic regimen that can induce a functional cure of chronic hepatitis B in a small, but significant, fraction of treated patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the antiviral functions of IFN-alpha in hepadnaviral infection may reveal molecular targets for development of novel antiviral agents to improve the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha. By a loss-of-function genetic screening of individual IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) on hepadnaviral mRNAs transcribed from cccDNA, we found that downregulating the expression of STAT1, SMCHD1, or PML significantly increased the level of viral RNAs without altering the level of cccDNA. Mechanistic analyses indicated that those cellular proteins are recruited to cccDNA minichromosomes and induce the posttranslational modifications of cccDNA-associated histones similar to those induced by IFN-alpha treatment. We have thus identified three IFN-alpha-induced cellular proteins that suppress cccDNA transcription and may partly mediate IFN-alpha silencing of hepadnaviral cccDNA transcription.",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Cheng, Junjun', 'Zhao, Qiong', 'Zhou, Yan', 'Tang, Liudi', 'Sheraz, Muhammad', 'Chang, Jinhong', 'Guo, Ju-Tao']","['Cheng J', 'Zhao Q', 'Zhou Y', 'Tang L', 'Sheraz M', 'Chang J', 'Guo JT']","['Baruch S.

Whether they lead to potent T cell activation despite described T cell dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and are able to effectively target high-risk or venetoclax-resistant samples, is currently unknown. METHODS: CD19(+) cell lines or primary (high-risk) CLL were cocultured in vitro with healthy donor (HD) or CLL-derived T cells in the presence of a CD3xCD19 dual affinity retargeting molecule (CD3xCD19 DART). Cell cytotoxicity, T cell activation, proliferation and effector molecule production were analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Here, we report that a bispecific CD3xCD19 DART mediates efficient killing by HD T cells of CD19(+) cell-lines and primary CLL cells, regardless of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutational status TP53 status or chemotherapy, ibrutinib or venetoclax sensitivity. Whereas TCR stimulation of CLL-derived T cells resulted in dysfunctional T cell activation and proliferation, treatment with CD3xCD19 DART led to a similar activation profile in CLL-derived and HD-derived T cells. Consistently, co-culture of CLL derived T cells with JeKo-1 or CLL cells in the presence of CD3xCD19 DART resulted in significant cytotoxicity by both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. On stimulation of CLL cells with CD40L, CLL cells become resistant to the specific inhibitor of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein venetoclax, due to upregulation of Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-XL. Nevertheless, CD40L stimulated CLL cells were as efficiently lysed on CD3xCD19 DART treatment as unstimulated CLL cells. Further examination of the mechanism of CD3xCD19 DART mediated killing showed that lysis was dependent on granules, but was independent of BAX/BAK or caspase activity, indicating non-apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that CD3xCD19 DART in CLL leads to robust T cell activation and lysis of high-risk venetoclax resistant CLL cells through a non-apoptotic mechanism.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Many of these pollutants cause adverse health outcomes by effects on mitochondrial function to produce oxidative stress through loss of the active site complex for oxidative phosphorylation, thioretinaco ozonide oxygen nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, from opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Glyphosate, fluoride, and electromagnetic fields are examples of carcinogenic pollutants that promote loss and decomposition of the active site for oxidative phosphorylation, producing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Ionizing radiation has long been known to be carcinogenic, and non-ionizing electromagnetic fields from microwaves, radar, cell phones and cathode ray screens are carcinogenic and produce deleterious effects on capillaries, nerve cells, blood brain barrier, embryonic and germ cells, lenses and cardiac function. Adverse health effects of electromagnetic fields include cataracts, infertility, congenital malformations, cancer, lymphocytosis, leukemia, hearing loss, blindness, retinal hemorrhages, cardiac arrhythmias, dermatitis, hair loss, depression, memory loss, premature aging, heart attacks, and weaponized mind control. The hyperhomocysteinemia, suppressed immunity, and altered oxidative metabolism observed in atherosclerosis and dementia are attributed to deficiency of adenosyl methionine which results from increased polyamine biosynthesis by pathogenic microbes that are demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cerebral plaques. Thus, environmental pollutants potentially promote diseases of aging, atherosclerosis, cancer, and premature aging by production of mitochondrial dysfunction.","['(c) 2020 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['McCully, Kilmer S']",['McCully KS'],"['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service, Boston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA kilmer.mccully@va.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,,['NOTNLM'],"['adenosine triphosphate', 'adenosyl methionine', 'atrial fibrillation', 'autonomic nervous system', 'carcinogenesis', 'cardiac arrhythmia', 'cellular senescence', 'cycloastragenol', 'electromagnetic field', 'environmental pollution', 'fluoride', 'glyphosate', 'homocysteine', 'inflammation', 'melatonin', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'mitochondrial membrane potential', 'mitochondrial permeability transition pore', 'mycotoxin', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'oxidative stress', 'ozone', 'telomere', 'thioretinaco ozonide']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['50/3/408 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2020 May;50(3):408-411.,,3,,20210405,"['0 (thioretinaco)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '4632WW1X5A (glyphosate)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Aging/pathology', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism/pathology', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Environmental Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Fluorides/adverse effects', 'Glycine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Homocysteine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperhomocysteinemia/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Vitamin B 12/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three frequent morphological variants have been recognized, including centroblastic, immunoblastic, and anaplastic variants. However, there are still other rare morphological variants of DLBCL, presenting challenge in diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman sought medical attention with a previous 6-month history of intermittent fever and leukocytosis. Bone marrow (BM) aspiration presented AML with acute monocytic leukemia-like morphologic features. The results of the immunophenotypic analysis suggested mature B cell lymphoma without obvious subtype characteristics. Lymph node biopsy indicated DLBCL of non-germinal centre B-cell subtype (n-GCB). Cytogenetic analysis of the BM cells revealed a 46,XX, trp(1)(q21q32),del(7)(q32q36),t(9;14)(p13;q32) [4]/46,XX [16] karyotype. The patient was diagnosed with EBV-positive DLBCL, NOS based on the combination of lymph node biopsy, clinical, cytological, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analyses. CONCLUSION: To date, no case reports of a patient diagnosed with DLBCL mimicking acute monocytic leukemia with complex karyotype have been reported. We present the case given its rarity, easy misdiagnosis, and poor prognosis.

However, after ibrutinib treatment initiation, patients frequently experience an increase of CLL blood cell count. This phenomenon in clinical practice is thought to reflect a ""compartment shift"" of CLL cells from lymph nodes to the peripheral blood, but the actual shifting has not yet been demonstrated. Using [(68)Ga]Pentixafor-PET/MRI for in vivo CXCR4 visualization, we here provide images of topical changes of CLL cells upon ibrutinib treatment. Within the first month of ibrutinib treatment, mean standardized [(68)Ga]Pentixafor uptake decreased in the bone marrow and lymph nodes, whereas [(68)Ga]Pentixafor uptake increased in the spleen. Leukocytosis rose, as did numbers of CXCR4(high) (tissue-resident) CLL cells. Volumes of lymph nodes and spleen decreased. Upon longer ibrutinib treatment, leukocytosis decreased, followed by a decrease of [(68)Ga]Pentixafor uptake in the spleen. These results support the preexisting clinical hypothesis of a ""compartment shift"" of CLL cells from the lymph nodes to the peripheral blood, but also refine the mechanistic model by describing early clearing of the bone marrow and redistribution of CLL cells to the orthotopic splenic cavernous system in response to ibrutinib treatment.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Mayerhoefer, Marius E', 'Haug, Alexander', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Pichler, Verena', 'Pfaff, Sarah', 'Wester, Hans-Jurgen', 'Hacker, Marcus', 'Kazianka, Lukas', 'Staber, Philipp B']","['Mayerhoefer ME', 'Haug A', 'Jager U', 'Pichler V', 'Pfaff S', 'Wester HJ', 'Hacker M', 'Kazianka L', 'Staber PB']","['Division of General and Pediatric Radiology, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Applied Metabolomics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. philipp.staber@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200624,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,PMC8373313,,,,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-19-0880 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-19-0880 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2020 Aug;8(8):984-989. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-19-0880.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this observational study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and BLC2 in 1099 early BC patients surgically treated between 2000 and 2006 and followed for at least 5 years, also considering their association with pathologic factors and molecular subtypes, as well as their influence on disease-free survival. RESULTS: p53 and BLC2 are distributed differently across molecular subtypes (P < .0001); in particular, p53 positivity and BLC2 negativity seems to be associated with more aggressive conventional tumor phenotypes. Moreover, BLC2 negativity seems to be a significant discriminating factor for disease-free survival (P = .003) according to Kaplan-Meier analysis, while p53 seems to have no discriminating effect. Among patients with discordant p53/BLC2 phenotype, the combination p53(+)BLC2(-) seems to be associated with the worst outcomes (P = .007) and significantly influenced the clinical course of node-negative patients treated only with hormone therapy (P = .004).

However, whether WT1 is enriched in the leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and facilitates the self-renewal of LSCs remains poorly understood. METHODS: MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia model was used to evaluate the effect of knockdown of wt1 on the self-renewal ability of LSC. RNA sequencing was performed on WT1-overexpressing cells to select WT1 targets. Apoptosis and colony formation assays were used to assess the anti-leukemic potential of a deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130. Furthermore, NOD/SCID-IL2Rgamma (NSG) AML xenotransplantation and MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia models were used to evaluate the anti-leukemogenic potential of WP1130 in vivo. RESULTS: We found that wt1 is highly expressed in LICs and LSCs and facilitates the maintenance of leukemia in a murine MLL-AF9-induced model of AML. WT1 enhanced the self-renewal of LSC by increasing the expression of BCL2L2, a member of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family, by direct binding to its promoter region. Loss of WT1 impaired self-renewal ability in LSC and delayed the progression of leukemia. WP1130 was found to modify the WT1-BCL2L2 axis, and WP1130-induced anti-leukemic activity was mediated by ubiquitin proteasome-mediated destruction of WT1 protein. WP1130 induced apoptosis and decreased colony formation abilities of leukemia cells and prolonged the overall survival in the THP1-based xenograft NSG mouse model. WP1130 also decreased the frequency of LSC and prolonged the overall survival in MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia model. Mechanistically, WP1130 induced the degradation of WT1 by positively affecting the ubiquitination of WT1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that WT1 is required for the development of AML. WP1130 exhibits anti-leukemic activity by inhibiting the WT1-BCL2L2 axis, which may represent a new acute myeloid leukemia therapy target.",,"['Zhou, Bin', 'Jin, Xianghong', 'Jin, Weiwei', 'Huang, Xingzhou', 'Wu, Yanfei', 'Li, Haiying', 'Zhu, Weijian', 'Qin, Xiaoyi', 'Ye, Haige', 'Gao, Shenmeng']","['Zhou B', 'Jin X', 'Jin W', 'Huang X', 'Wu Y', 'Li H', 'Zhu W', 'Qin X', 'Ye H', 'Gao S']","['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wenzhou Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China. haigeye@sina.com.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 1 Xuefubei Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China. gaoshenmeng77@wzhospital.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200624,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,PMC7313134,['NOTNLM'],"['*Deubiquitinase inhibitor', '*Leukemia stem cell', '*Leukemia-initiating cell', '*Self-renewal', '*Ubiquitin-proteasome signal', ""*Wilms' tumor-1""]",,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-020-02384-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-020-02384-y [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2020 Jun 24;18(1):254. doi: 10.1186/s12967-020-02384-y.,,1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1223-4325'],20210514,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl2l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we further explored the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory mechanism between Bmi-1 and RKIP. METHODS: Microarray analysis was first carried out to identify miRNA profiles that were differentially expressed in cells overexpressing Bmi-1. Then, miRNAs that could regulate RKIP were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to measure the expression of Bmi-1, miR-155, miR-27a and RKIP. RKIP was confirmed as a target of miR-27a and miR-155 through luciferase reporter assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The effects of the Bmi-1/miR-27a/RKIP and Bmi-1/miR-155/RKIP axes on tumor growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, colony-formation ability, metastasis and chemoresistance were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The downregulation of RKIP by Bmi-1 occurred at the protein but not mRNA level. This indicates probable posttranscriptional regulation. miRNA expression profiles of cells with ectopic expression of Bmi-1 were analyzed and compared to those of control cells by microarray analysis. A total of 51 upregulated and 72 downregulated miRNAs were identified. Based on publicly available algorithms, miR-27a and miR-155 were predicted, selected and demonstrated to target RKIP. Bmi-1, miR-27a and miR-155 are elevated in human GC and associated with poor prognosis of GC, while RKIP is expressed at lower levels in GC and correlated with good prognosis. Then, in vitro tests shown that in addition to regulating RKIP expression via miR-27a and miR-155, Bmi-1 was also able to regulate the migration, invasion, proliferation, colony-formation ability and chemosensitivity of GC cells through the same pathway. Finally, the in vivo test showed similar results, whereby the knockdown of the Bmi-1 gene led to the inhibition of tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance through miR-27a and miR-155. CONCLUSIONS: Bmi-1 was proven to induce the expression of miR-27a and miR-155 and thus promote tumor metastasis and chemoresistance by targeting RKIP in GC.

Studies of nanoencapsulated resveratrol have indicated that this compound can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and free radicals. The aim of this study was to isolate resveratrol from Vitis vinifera, develop and evaluate resveratrol nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and/or resveratrol encapsulated chitosan-coated nanostructured lipid carriers (CSNLCs) using low-viscous chitosan for anticancer therapy. In addition, our study was carried out to examine the prophylactic potential of RES, NLC, and CSNLC on paraquat-induced injury in rat hepatocytes. In this study we isolated resveratrol and encapsulated NLCs in phosphate-buffered saline solution using a phase inversion method. In addition, CSNLCs were prepared by ionic gelation method of NLCs using chitosan. NLCs and CSNLCs were then characterized for their particle size, zeta potential, morphology, and entrapment efficiency. Furthermore, NLCs and CSNLCs were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect on Hep-G2, human HCT-116 (colorectal cancer cell line), lymphoblastic leukemia (1301), and human MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) cells as well as their effect on caspase-3 and death receptor (DR-4). In addition, incubation of hepatocytes with paraquat resulted in increased formation of TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) with a parallel increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage at 1 h after incubation. Time-dependent depletion of cellular glutathione (GSH) was observed starting 2 h after incubation with paraquat. The mean particle size of NLC and CSNLC were 67.0 and 98.41 nm, zeta potential were (-) 24.8 and (+) 31.6 mV, entrapment efficiency were 74.15% and 85.46%, respectively, with the observed shapes of nanoparticle being spherical. The treatment of Hep-G2, human HCT-116, lymphoblastic leukemia (1301), and human MCF-7 cells with NLC led to high inhibition in the cell proliferation as concluded by the low IC50 values 27.7, 17.43, 35.39, and 47.66 mug/mL, respectively, whereas CSNLC had high cytotoxic effect on Hep-G2, human HCT-116, lymphoblastic leukemia (1301), and human MCF-7 cells with low IC50 values 13.29, 10.56, 16.79 and 22.60 mug/mL, respectively. Both NLC and CSNLC possess apoptotic properties through activation of the caspase-3 and death receptor (DR-4). In addition, incubation of hepatocytes with RES, NLC, and CSNLC markedly protected against paraquat-induced formation of TBARS, increase in LDH leakage, and prevented GSH depletion. The most effective doses for ethyl acetate, ethanolic, and aqueous extracts were 7.5, 10, and 12.5 mug, respectively. The results presented here may suggest that nanoencapsulated resveratrol isolated from the stems of V. vinifera to obtain NLC and CSNLC possess anticancer and apoptotic effects on cell proliferation, and therefore, can be used as new approach of pharmaceutical drugs. In addition, the results clearly suggest that the RES, NLC, and CSNLC exerted protective effect against cytotoxicity induced by paraquat. On the contrary, the effect decreased in order of CSNLC, NLC, and RES.",,"['Elgizawy, Heba A', 'Ali, Ali A', 'Hussein, Mohammed A']","['Elgizawy HA', 'Ali AA', 'Hussein MA']","['Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy and Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, October 6 University, Sixth of October City, Egypt.', 'Vice President of Post Graduate Studies, October 6 University, Sixth of October City, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, October 6 University, Sixth of October City, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200622,United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,,['NOTNLM'],"['HCT-116', 'Hep-G2', 'lymphoblastic leukemia and MCF-7', 'nanostructured lipid carrier', 'proliferation', 'resveratrol', 'viability']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jmf.2019.0286 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2021 Jan;24(1):89-100. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2019.0286.

Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the effects of extracellular adenine nucleotides and adenosine on the growth and death parameters in the leukemic THP-1 cell line. Cells were exposed to ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine and nonhydrolyzable analogues of ATP and ADP (ATPgammaS and ADPbetaS) in a 1-1000 muM broad concentration range. The basal mRNA expression of the P1 and P2 receptors was evaluated by real-time PCR. Changes in the processes of cell growth and death were assessed by flow cytometry analysis of proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. Chemotaxis toward stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) was performed using the modified Boyden chamber assay, and chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) surface expression was quantified by flow cytometry. We indicated several antileukemic actions. High micromolar concentrations (100-1000 muM) of extracellular adenine nucleotides and adenosine inhibit the growth of cells by arresting the cell cycle and/or inducing apoptosis. ATP is characterized by the highest potency and widest range of effects, and is responsible for the cell cycle arrest and the apoptosis induction. Compared to ATP, the effect of ADP is slightly weaker. Adenosine mostly has a cytotoxic effect, with the induction of apoptosis. The last studied nucleotide, AMP, demonstrated only a weak cytotoxic effect without affecting the cell cycle. In addition, cell migration towards SDF-1 was inhibited by low micromolar concentrations (10 muM). One of the reasons for this action of ATPgammaS and adenosine was a reduction in CXCR4 surface expression, but this only partially explains the mechanism of antimigratory action. In summary, extracellular adenine nucleotides and adenosine inhibit THP-1 cell growth, cause death of cells and modulate the functioning of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. Thus, they negatively affect the processes that are responsible for the progression of AML and the difficulties in AML treatment.",,"['Puchalowicz, Kamila', 'Tarnowski, Maciej', 'Tkacz, Marta', 'Chlubek, Dariusz', 'Klos, Patrycja', 'Dziedziejko, Violetta']","['Puchalowicz K', 'Tarnowski M', 'Tkacz M', 'Chlubek D', 'Klos P', 'Dziedziejko V']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Powstancow Wlkp. 72 av., 70-111 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Powstancow Wlkp. 72 av., 70-111 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Powstancow Wlkp. 72 av., 70-111 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Powstancow Wlkp. 72 av., 70-111 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Powstancow Wlkp. 72 av., 70-111 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Powstancow Wlkp. 72 av., 70-111 Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200622,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7352165,['NOTNLM'],"['SDF-1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'chemoresistance', 'cytotoxicity', 'extracellular nucleotides', 'proliferation', 'purinergic signaling']",,2020/06/26 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/06/26 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21124425 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21124425 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 22;21(12). pii: ijms21124425. doi: 10.3390/ijms21124425.,,12,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8109-7112', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3869-5077', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8311-0824', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4497-4395']",20210319,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""35094-45-2 (adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate))"", ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Affinity Labels', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since we found that high expression of RUNX1 is correlated with poor survival in patients with OC through bioinformatic analysis of TCGA database, we developed RUNX1-knockout clones by CRISPR/Cas9 technique and discovered that RUNX1 depletion could promote cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OC cells, which was further confirmed by RUNX1 knockdown and overexpression. We also proved that RUNX1 could elevate the expression of BCL2. We then examined a total of 32 candidate miRNAs that might mediate the regulation between RUNX1 and BCL2, of which three miRNAs from the miR-17~92 cluster were found to be negatively regulated by RUNX1. Consistently, our analysis of data from TCGA database revealed the negative correlation between RUNX1 and the cluster. We further confirmed that miR-17~92 cluster could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis by directly targeting BCL2 3'UTR. Since rescue experiments proved that RUNX1 could repress cisplatin-induced apoptosis by up-regulating BCL2 via miR-17~92 cluster, combining RUNX1 inhibitor Ro5-3335 and cisplatin showed synergic effect in triggering OC cell apoptosis. Collectively, these findings show for the first time that combinational treatment of cisplatin and RUNX1 inhibitor could be used to potentiate apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells, and reveal the potential of targeting RUNX1 in ovarian cancer chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In both human and animal models, MORRBID hyperactivation correlates with two recurrent AML drivers, TET2 and FLT3(ITD). Mice with individual mutations of Tet2 or Flt3(ITD) develop features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), respectively, and combined presence results in AML.

The virus causes immune system deregulation, favoring the development of secondary infections. In that context, mastitis incidence is believed to be increased in BLV infected cattle. The aim of this study was to analyze the transcriptome profile of a BLV infected mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T). Our results show that BLV infected MAC-T cells have an altered expression of IFN I signal pathway and genes involved in defense response to virus, as well as a collagen catabolic process and some protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

There are limited studies on CLL from the Indian subcontinent. METHODS: This was a prospective study (2011-2017) of consecutively diagnosed patients with CLL at a single center. The diagnosis, prognosis, treatment indication, response criteria, and adverse events were recorded as per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines. Biosimilar rituximab dosing (375 mg/m(2)) was fixed for all cycles. Time to next treatment (TTNT) was defined as the time from front-line treatment initiation to next treatment or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from treatment initiation until death from any cause. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients with CLL were enrolled over the study period. The median follow-up was 32 months (range, 2-135 months). The median age was 61 years, and 31.8% of patients with CLL were </= 55 years of age; 43.3% of patients had a cumulative illness rating scale score >/= 3. Prognostic fluorescence in situ hybridization data were available in 53.3% of patients. Chlorambucil (94/180; 52.2%) and bendamustine + rituximab (BR; 57/180; 31.6%) were the most common regimens used up front. The overall response rates after front-line therapy were 74.4% and 91.2%, respectively. The TTNT was 33 months and not reached, respectively (P = .001). Grade 3/4 neutropenia and infections were seen in 52.6% and 38.5% of patients receiving BR. The median OS was not reached in both regimens (P = .25). CONCLUSION: Indian patients with CLL are younger in chronological age but have higher morbidity burden. Treatment outcomes with biosimilar fixed-dose BR are comparable to those reported in the literature. Chlorambucil is still a valid option, given the economic burden of the disease and treatment.",,"['Tejaswi, V', 'Lad, Deepesh P', 'Jindal, Nishant', 'Prakash, Gaurav', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Khadwal, Alka', 'Jain, Arihant', 'Sreedharanunni, Sreejesh', 'Sachdeva, Manupdesh Singh', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash']","['Tejaswi V', 'Lad DP', 'Jindal N', 'Prakash G', 'Malhotra P', 'Khadwal A', 'Jain A', 'Sreedharanunni S', 'Sachdeva MS', 'Naseem S', 'Varma N', 'Varma S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,PMC7328099,,,,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.20.00032 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Jun;6:866-872. doi: 10.1200/GO.20.00032.,,,,20210728,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'India/epidemiology', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that APBs behave as liquid condensates in response to telomere DNA damage, suggesting two potential functions: condensation to enrich DNA repair factors and coalescence to cluster telomeres. To test these models, we developed a chemically induced dimerization approach to induce de novo APB condensation in live cells without DNA damage. We show that telomere-binding protein sumoylation nucleates APB condensation via interactions between small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and SUMO interaction motif (SIM), and that APB coalescence drives telomere clustering. The induced APBs lack DNA repair factors, indicating that APB functions in promoting telomere clustering can be uncoupled from enriching DNA repair factors. Indeed, telomere clustering relies only on liquid properties of the condensate, as an alternative condensation chemistry also induces clustering independent of sumoylation. Our findings introduce a chemical dimerization approach to manipulate phase separation and demonstrate how the material properties and chemical composition of APBs independently contribute to ALT, suggesting a general framework for how chromatin condensates promote cellular functions.",,"['Zhang, Huaiying', 'Zhao, Rongwei', 'Tones, Jason', 'Liu, Michel', 'Dilley, Robert L', 'Chenoweth, David M', 'Greenberg, Roger A', 'Lampson, Michael A']","['Zhang H', 'Zhao R', 'Tones J', 'Liu M', 'Dilley RL', 'Chenoweth DM', 'Greenberg RA', 'Lampson MA']","['Departments of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Departments of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Departments of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Departments of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Departments of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Penn Center for Genome Integrity, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Basser Center for BRCA, Perelman School of Medicine.', 'Penn Center for Genome Integrity, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Penn Center for Genome Integrity, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200624,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,PMC7543070,,,,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.E19-10-0589 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2020 Aug 15;31(18):2048-2056. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E19-10-0589.

These patients often present with comorbidities limiting treatment options. During the last decade, the treatment paradigm has rapidly changed with the introduction of novel oral targeted agents and monoclonal antibodies. AREAS COVERED: The review focuses on the combination of type II antiCD20 antibody obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy or oral targeted agents in patients not suited for fludarabine-based therapy because of comorbidities or age. The main focus of the review is whether classical immunochemotherapy with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil is still a valid therapeutic option or whether the combination of obinutuzumab and ibrutinib or venetoclax presents novel standard of care. EXPERT OPINION: Both pivotal and registrational studies iLLLUMINATE study testing the combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab and CLL14 study testing the fixed combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab have shown major benefit over chemoimmunotherapy approach in this population. Furthermore, they have excellent activity in high-risk subgroups of CLL paving the road toward a chemo-free immunotherapy approach in this setting.

Similarly, leukemia cell-derived exosomes (LEXs) can induce antileukemia immune responses in animal models. However, the antileukemia immunity induced by LEXs is less effective, which may be due to an inadequate costimulatory capacity. METHODS: In this study, we transduced L1210 leukemia cells with a lentiviral vector encoding two B7 costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) and obtained LEXs that highly expressed CD80 and CD86. The antileukemia immune response derived from these LEXs was examined in vitro and in vivo in animal models. RESULTS: We found that B7 gene-modified LEXs, including LEX-CD80, LEX-CD86, and LEX-8086, could significantly boost the expression of CD80 and CD86 in dendritic cells (DCs) and promote the secretion of functional cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-12. Moreover, these B7 gene-modified LEXs, particularly LEX-CD8086, could effectively induce CD4(+) T cell proliferation, Th1 cytokine secretion, and an antigen-specific anti-leukemia cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response.

RECENT FINDINGS: Advanced imaging using 18FDG-PET/CT is an effective screening tool for EM manifestations of leukemia. The role of radiation therapy has been more clearly delineated in the treatment of both MS and LC. FDA-approved targeted agents have improved outcomes in patients with AML but have not demonstrated improvements specifically for EM; however, a checkpoint inhibitor, Ipilimumab, holds promise in impacting local control for the treatment of AML-related EM. EM manifestations of leukemia pose significant therapeutic challenges.

Data of 323 patients with Ph-negative ALL treated at Peking University People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. MK was identified in 49 (14.8%) patients. The patients with MK had lower hemoglobin levels (P = 0.026), lower platelet count (P = 0.032), higher percentages of blasts in the peripheral blood at diagnosis (P = 0.008), and higher percentages of high-risk karyotypes (P < 0.001) compared with those without MK. The complete remission (CR) rate and the minimal residual disease negativity rate were not significantly different between patients with and without MK. In the multivariate analysis, MK was identified as an independent factor associated with higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (hazard ratio (HR), 2.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02, 4.21; P = 0.043), shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.20, 6.54; P = 0.017) and shorter overall survival (OS) (HR, 5.75; 95% CI, 2.07, 16.03; P = 0.001) in the chemotherapy cohort; however, MK had no impact on outcomes in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) cohort. Mantel-Byar analysis showed that allo-HSCT was associated with lower CIR (P < 0.001), longer DFS (P < 0.001), and longer OS (P < 0.001) in CR patients with MK. In conclusion, our study showed that MK was an independent predictor of poor outcomes in patients with Ph-negative ALL receiving chemotherapy but not allo-HSCT, and allo-HSCT could improve the outcomes of patients with MK.",,"['Li, Zongru', 'Lai, Yueyun', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Xu, Lanping', 'Liu, Kaiyan', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yan, Chenhua', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Qian']","['Li Z', 'Lai Y', 'Zhang X', 'Xu L', 'Liu K', 'Wang Y', 'Yan C', 'Jiang H', 'Huang X', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China. huangxiaojun@bjmu.edu.cn."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China. jiangqian@medmail.com.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200623,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Monosomal karyotype']",,2020/06/25 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04155-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04155-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Aug;99(8):1833-1843. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04155-7.

The incidence of leukemia varies by pathological types and among different populations. Methods: We retrieved the incidence data for leukemia by sex, age, location, calendar year, and type from the Global Burden of Disease online database. The estimated average percentage change (EAPC) was used to quantify the trends of the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of leukemia from 1990 to 2017. Results: Globally, while the number of newly diagnosed leukemia cases increased from 354.5 thousand in 1990 to 518.5 thousand in 2017, the ASIR decreased by 0.43% per year. The number of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases worldwide increased from 49.1 thousand in 1990 to 64.2 thousand in 2017, whereas the ASIR experienced a decrease (EAPC = - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.15, - 0.02). Between 1990 and 2017, there were 55, 29, and 111 countries or territories that experienced a significant increase, remained stable, and experienced a significant decrease in ASIR of ALL, respectively. The case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has increased more than twice between 1990 and 2017. The ASIR of CLL increased by 0.46% per year from 1990 to 2017. More than 85% of all countries saw an increase in ASIR of CLL. In 1990, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounted for 18.0% of the total leukemia cases worldwide. This proportion increased to 23.1% in 2017. The ASIR of AML increased from 1.35/100,000 to 1.54/100,000, with an EAPC of 0.56 (95% CI 0.49, 0.62). A total of 127 countries or territories experienced a significant increase in the ASIR of AML. The number of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases increased from 31.8 thousand in 1990 to 34.2 thousand in 2017. The ASIR of CML decreased from 0.75/100,000 to 0.43/100,000. A total of 141 countries or territories saw a decrease in ASIR of CML. Conclusions: A significant decrease in leukemia incidence was observed between 1990 and 2017.

High-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HiDAC/MITO) is an established salvage therapy for these patients. We studied all adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML who were treated with HiDAC/MITO in our center between the years 2008-2017. To determine whether responding patients harbored a unique molecular signature, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on a subset of patients. The study cohort consisted of 172 patients with a median age of 54 years (range 18-77). The composite complete remission rate was 58%; 11 patients (6%) died during salvage therapy. Median survival was 11.4 months with a 1-year survival rate of 48%. In multivariate analysis favorable risk cytogenetics [Odds ratio (OR)=0.34, confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.17-0.68; P = 0.002], and de-novo AML (OR = 0.4, CI 95%, 0.16-0.98; P = 0.047) were independently associated with a favorable response. Patients who attained a complete remission had a median survival of 43.7 months compared with 5.2 months for refractory patients (p < 0.0001). Neither the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutational status nor the indication for salvage therapy significantly impacted on the response to HiDAC/MITO salvage. NGS analysis identified 20 different mutations across the myeloid gene spectrum with a distinct TP53 signature detected in non-responding patients. HiDAC/MITO is an effective salvage regimen in R/R AML, however patients with adverse cytogenetics or secondary disease may not benefit as much from this approach.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Canaani et al.'],"['Canaani, Jonathan', 'Nagar, Meital', 'Heering, Gabriel', 'Gefen, Chen', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Merkel, Drorit', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Rechavi, Gidi', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Canaani J', 'Nagar M', 'Heering G', 'Gefen C', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Volchek Y', 'Merkel D', 'Avigdor A', 'Shimoni A', 'Amariglio N', 'Rechavi G', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200609,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC7289527,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'next-generation sequencing']",['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None.'],2020/06/25 06:00,2020/06/25 06:01,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27618 [doi]', '27618 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Jun 9;11(23):2233-2245. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27618. eCollection 2020 Jun 9.,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to analyse the change in the outcome of treatment of paediatric malignancies in Lithuania over 30 years. Methods: A single-centre retrospective analysis of children below 18 years of age treated for cancer at Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos between 1982 and 2011 was carried out. The minimal requirement of 5-year follow-up after diagnosis was specified for survival estimation. The vital status was assessed using data from the population-based Lithuanian Cancer Registry. To evaluate changes over time, the entire cohort was split into three groups according to the time of diagnosis: 1982-1991, 1992-2001, and 2002-2011. Results: A total of 1268 children met the inclusion criteria. The shortest median follow-up was 8.9 (IQR 6.4-11.5) years for patients treated in the third decade. The 5-year overall survival of the entire cohort increased from 37.3% (95% CI 30.2-44.3) in 1982-1991 to 70.7% (95% CI 66.4-74.1) in 2002-2011 (p < 0.0001). The same trend was evident when calculated separately for leukaemia (p < 0.0001), lymphoma (p < 0.0005), and solid tumours (p < 0.004). The percentage of cure rose from zero in the early years of the period analysed to 80% in 2010 and 2011. The improvement in the treatment outcome was attributable to the reduction of treatment-related mortality from 45.8% in 1982-1991 to 12.4% in 2002-2011 and disease recurrence from 30.4% to 19.6% for the same periods, respectively. Conclusions: Significant progress in the cure rate of children treated for cancer at our institution was observed over 30 years. Collaborative national and international clinical and research efforts are crucial to ensure further advances in care and cure.","['(c) Lietuvos mokslu akademija, 2020.']","['Rascon, Jelena', 'Smailyte, Giedre']","['Rascon J', 'Smailyte G']","['Centre for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'National Cancer Institute, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Lithuania,Acta Med Litu,Acta medica Lituanica,9442465,PMC7305808,['NOTNLM'],"['Lithuania', 'childhood cancer', 'survival']",,2020/06/25 06:00,2020/06/25 06:01,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.6001/actamedica.v27i1.4260 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Litu. 2020;27(1):1-9. doi: 10.6001/actamedica.v27i1.4260.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the tumor suppressor function of this complex is widely established in solid tumors, its role in hematologic malignancies is largely unknown. Recurrent point mutations in BCL7A gene, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, have been reported in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but their functional impact remains to be elucidated. Here we show that BCL7A often undergoes biallelic inactivation, including a previously unnoticed mutational hotspot in the splice donor site of intron one. The splice site mutations render a truncated BCL7A protein, lacking a portion of the amino-terminal domain. Moreover, restoration of wild-type BCL7A expression elicits a tumor suppressor-like phenotype in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, splice site mutations block the tumor suppressor function of BCL7A by preventing its binding to the SWI/SNF complex. We also show that BCL7A restoration induces transcriptomic changes in genes involved in B-cell activation. In addition, we report that SWI/SNF complex subunits harbor mutations in more than half of patients with germinal center B-cell (GCB)-DLBCL. Overall, this work demonstrates the tumor suppressor function of BCL7A in DLBCL, and highlights that the SWI/SNF complex plays a relevant role in DLBCL pathogenesis.",,"['Balinas-Gavira, Carlos', 'Rodriguez, Maria I', 'Andrades, Alvaro', 'Cuadros, Marta', 'Alvarez-Perez, Juan Carlos', 'Alvarez-Prado, Angel F', 'de Yebenes, Virginia G', 'Sanchez-Hernandez, Sabina', 'Fernandez-Vigo, Elvira', 'Munoz, Javier', 'Martin, Francisco', 'Ramiro, Almudena R', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A', 'Medina, Pedro P']","['Balinas-Gavira C', 'Rodriguez MI', 'Andrades A', 'Cuadros M', 'Alvarez-Perez JC', 'Alvarez-Prado AF', 'de Yebenes VG', 'Sanchez-Hernandez S', 'Fernandez-Vigo E', 'Munoz J', 'Martin F', 'Ramiro AR', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Medina PP']","['Gene Expression Regulation and Cancer Group (CTS-993).

These mutations are frequently monoallelic, within the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain and usually mutually exclusive, suggesting that they might affect a common pathway, and their residual WT expression is required for cell survival. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that inhibition of CARM1 activity (CARM1i) slows DLBCL growth, and that the levels of sensitivity are positively correlated with the CREBBP/EP300 mutation load. Conversely, treatment of DLBCLs that do not have CREBBP/EP300 mutations with CARM1i and a CBP/p300 inhibitor revealed a strong synergistic effect. Our mechanistic data show that CARM1i further reduces the HAT activity of CBP genome wide and downregulates CBP-target genes in DLBCL cells, resulting in a synthetic lethality that leverages the mutational status of CREBBP/EP300 as a biomarker for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of CARM1 in DLBCL and other cancers.",,"['Veazey, Kylee J', 'Cheng, Donghang', 'Lin, Kevin', 'Villarreal, Oscar D', 'Gao, Guozhen', 'Perez-Oquendo, Mabel', 'Van, Hieu T', 'Stratton, Sabrina A', 'Green, Michael', 'Xu, Han', 'Lu, Yue', 'Bedford, Mark T', 'Santos, Margarida Almeida']","['Veazey KJ', 'Cheng D', 'Lin K', 'Villarreal OD', 'Gao G', 'Perez-Oquendo M', 'Van HT', 'Stratton SA', 'Green M', 'Xu H', 'Lu Y', 'Bedford MT', 'Santos MA']","['Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. mialmeidasantos@mdanderson.org.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. mialmeidasantos@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC7688486,,,,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0908-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0908-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3269-3285. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0908-8.

Using lentiviral expression of MN1 for oncogenic supplementation and transplanting transduced primary mononuclear CMML cells into immunocompromised mice, we established three serially transplantable CMML-PDX models with disease-related gene mutations that recapitulate the disease in vivo. Ectopic MN1 expression was confirmed to enhance the proliferation of CMML cells, which otherwise did not engraft upon secondary transplantation. Furthermore, MN1-supplemented CMML cells were serially transplantable into recipient mice up to 5 generations. This robust engraftment enabled an in vivo RNA interference screening targeting CMML-related mutated genes including NRAS, confirming that their functional relevance is preserved in the presence of MN1. The novel combination treatment with azacitidine and the MEK-inhibitor trametinib additively inhibited ERK-phosphorylation and thus depleted the signal from mutated NRAS. The combination treatment significantly prolonged survival of CMML mice compared to single-agent treatment.

Here, using gene silencing and overexpression approaches, RNA-Seq, and splicing analysis, we report that the transcription factor B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and drives metastatic disease. Moreover, BCL11A promotes cancer cell invasion by suppressing the expression of muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 (MBNL1), a splicing regulator that suppresses metastasis. This ultimately increases the levels of an alternatively spliced isoform of integrin-alpha6 (ITGA6), which is associated with worse patient outcomes. These results suggest that BCL11A sustains TNBC cell invasion and metastatic growth by repressing MBNL1-directed splicing of ITGA6 Our findings also indicate that BCL11A lies at the interface of transcription and splicing and promotes aggressive TNBC phenotypes.",['(c) 2020 Seachrist et al.'],"['Seachrist, Darcie D', 'Hannigan, Molly M', 'Ingles, Natasha N', 'Webb, Bryan M', 'Weber-Bonk, Kristen L', 'Yu, Peng', 'Bebek, Gurkan', 'Singh, Salendra', 'Sizemore, Steven T', 'Varadan, Vinay', 'Licatalosi, Donny D', 'Keri, Ruth A']","['Seachrist DD', 'Hannigan MM', 'Ingles NN', 'Webb BM', 'Weber-Bonk KL', 'Yu P', 'Bebek G', 'Singh S', 'Sizemore ST', 'Varadan V', 'Licatalosi DD', 'Keri RA']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for RNA Science and Therapeutics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and TEES-AgriLife Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of General Medical Sciences-Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Ohio State University, Arthur G.

In advanced disease, multiple myeloma can spread to the blood as plasma cell leukemia. In some cases, a localized tumor known as plasmacytoma is found within a single bone. Despite the approval of several agents such as melphalan, corticosteroids, proteasome inhibitors, thalidomide-based immuno-modulatory agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, a nuclear export inhibitor and monoclonal antibodies daratuzumab and elatuzumab, the disease presently remains uncurable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to define new targets and treatment modalities we searched the literature for microRNAs, which increase or inhibit in vivo efficacy in multiple-myeloma-related xenograft models.

They are characterized by epithelioid cells, which stain with melanocytic markers, associated with spindle cells reactive for smooth muscle markers. PEComas may be sporadic or associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex, with mutations affecting mostly tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 2 and less frequently TSC1 genes. More recently a subtype of PEComa harboring TFE3 gene rearrangement, mutually exclusive with TSC complex mutations, has been identified. The bladder and the other genitourinary tract organs are an infrequent site of origin; to date, only 3 cases of primitive bladder PEComas, 1 prostatic PEComa, and 2 epithelioid angiomyolipomas of the kidney with TFE3 rearrangement have been described in literature. We report a bladder PEComa case with Xp11 rearrangement in a patient who previously had undergone chemotherapy for chronic lymphatic leukemia. We assessed the meaning of the presence of TFE3 rearrangement in genitourinary tract PEComas and the possible correlation of these uncommon lesions with previous chemotherapy. A better understanding of this entity's genetics may help suggest appropriate targeted therapy, which is still lacking in genitourinary tract PEComas.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are still many neoplastic diseases that are difficult to treat. For example, it is often difficult to find effective therapies for aggressive cancer and leukemia. An NF-kappaB inhibitor named dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) was discovered in 2000. This compound was designed based on the structure of epoxyquinomicin isolated from a microorganism. It was shown to be a specific inhibitor that directly binds to and inactivates NF-kappaB components. Until now, DHMEQ has been used by many scientists in the world to suppress animal models of cancer and inflammation. Especially, it was shown to suppress difficult cancer models, such as hormone-insensitive breast cancer and prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and multiple myeloma. No toxicity has been reported so far. DHMEQ was administered via the intraperitoneal (IP) route in most of the animal experiments because of its simplicity. In the course of developmental studies, it was found that IP administration never increased the blood concentration of DHMEQ because of the instability of DHMEQ in the blood. It is suggested that inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity would be important for cancer progression, and that IP administration, itself, is important for the effectiveness and safety of DHMEQ. In the present review, we describe mechanism of action, its in vivo anticancer activity, and future clinical use of DHMEQ IP therapy.",,"['Umezawa, Kazuo', 'Breborowicz, Andrzej', 'Gantsev, Shamil']","['Umezawa K', 'Breborowicz A', 'Gantsev S']","['Department of Molecular Target Medicine, Aichi Medical UniversityNagakuteJapan.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Poznan University of Medical SciencesPoznanPoland.', 'Scientific Research Institute of Oncology, Bashkortostan State Medical UniversityUfaRussia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200623,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,PMC7751220,,,,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504020X15929100013698 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2020 Dec 10;28(5):541-550. doi: 10.3727/096504020X15929100013698.

The treatment and clinical symptoms may lead to patients' supportive care needs (SCNs) not being met and impairs their quality of life (QoL). Studies on QoL and SCNs among AL patients are limited. This study aimed to identify the unmet SCNs and its relation to QoL of adult AL patients in China. METHODS: This multicentre cross-sectional study recruited 346 participants to complete a self-developed questionnaire, detailing demographic information and disease-related variables. A 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34) was used to identify unmet SCNs, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukaemia (FACT-Leu) questionnaire measured patients' QoL. RESULTS: Unmet SCN rates for the 34 items ranged from17.6 to 81.7%. Patients' needs were high for health systems and information, but low in the sexual domain. The results reveal nine factors associated with the unmet SCNs of adult AL patients, including marital status, original residence, age, education, occupation, other diseases, chemotherapy course, disease course, and treatment stage (p < 0.05). The total score of the FACT-Leu negatively correlated with the SCNS-SF34 in the physical/daily living (r = - 0.527, p < 0.01), psychological (r = - 0.688, p < 0.01), sexual (r = - 0.170, p < 0.01), patient care and support (r = - 0.352, p < 0.01), and health systems and information (r = - 0.220, p < 0.01) domains. CONCLUSIONS: Adult AL patients exhibit a high demand for unmet SCNs, especially in the domain of health systems and information. There was a significant association between patients' unmet SCNs and QoL. Future research should develop tailored interventions to address the unmet SCNs of adult AL patients, to further improve their QoL.",,"['Jie, Yan', 'Wang, Ying', 'Chen, Jingyi', 'Wang, Chunfeng', 'Lin, Yingchun', 'Hu, Rong', 'Wu, Yong']","['Jie Y', 'Wang Y', 'Chen J', 'Wang C', 'Lin Y', 'Hu R', 'Wu Y']","['School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, NO.1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350122, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, NO.1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350122, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, NO.1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350122, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, NO.1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350122, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian University, No. 20 of Chazhong Road, Taijiang District, Fuzhou City, 350004, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, NO.1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350122, Fujian Province, China. ronghu1246@fjmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Gulou District, Fuzhou City, 350001, Fujian Province, China. wuyong9195@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200623,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,PMC7310469,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukaemia', 'Cancer patients', 'Chemotherapy', 'Life quality', 'Needs domains', 'Supportive care']",,2020/06/25 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12955-020-01454-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12955-020-01454-5 [pii]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2020 Jun 23;18(1):199. doi: 10.1186/s12955-020-01454-5.,"['2018-ZQN-63/the Scientific Research Talents Training Project from Fujian Province', 'Health Commission, China', '2019J01684/Nature Science Foundation of Fujian Provincial']",1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9949-7528'],20201021,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'China', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, the prevalence of STLV-1 infection in Japanese macaques (JMs) is estimated to be > 60%, much greater than that in other non-human primates; however, the mechanism and mode of STLV-1 transmission remain unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the epidemiological background by which STLV-1 infection is highly prevalent in JMs. RESULTS: The prevalence of STLV-1 in the JMs rearing in our free-range facility reached up to 64% (180/280 JMs) with variation from 55 to 77% among five independent troops. Anti-STLV-1 antibody titers (ABTs) and STLV-1 proviral loads (PVLs) were normally distributed with mean values of 4076 and 0.62%, respectively, which were mostly comparable to those of HTLV-1-infected humans. Our initial hypothesis that some of the macaques might contribute to frequent horizontal STLV-1 transmission as viral super-spreaders was unlikely because of the absence of the macaques exhibiting abnormally high PVLs but poor ABTs. Rather, ABTs and PVLs were statistically correlated (p < 0.0001), indicating that the increasing PVLs led to the greater humoral immune response. Further analyses demonstrated that the STLV-1 prevalence as determined by detection of the proviral DNA was dramatically increased with age; 11%, 31%, and 58% at 0, 1, and 2 years of age, respectively, which was generally consistent with the result of seroprevalence and suggested the frequent incidence of mother-to-child transmission. Moreover, our longitudinal follow-up study indicated that 24 of 28 seronegative JMs during the periods from 2011 to 2012 converted to seropositive (86%) 4 years later; among them, the seroconversion rates of sexually matured (4 years of age and older) macaques and immature macaques (3 years of age and younger) at the beginning of study were comparably high (80% and 89%, respectively), suggesting the frequent incidence of horizontal transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the fact that almost all of the full-adult JMs older than 9 years old were infected with STLV-1, our results of this study demonstrated for the first time that frequent horizontal and mother-to-child transmission may contribute to high prevalence of STLV-1 infection in JMs.",,"['Murata, Megumi', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Washizaki, Ayaka', 'Seki, Yohei', 'Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Tan, Wei Keat', 'Hu, Anna', 'Okuma, Kazu', 'Hamaguchi, Isao', 'Mizukami, Takuo', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Akari, Hirofumi']","['Murata M', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Washizaki A', 'Seki Y', 'Kuramitsu M', 'Tan WK', 'Hu A', 'Okuma K', 'Hamaguchi I', 'Mizukami T', 'Matsuoka M', 'Akari H']","['Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Disease, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1 Honjo Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Disease, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1 Honjo Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, 484-8506, Japan. akari.hirofumi.5z@kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Infectious Disease Model, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. akari.hirofumi.5z@kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200623,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC7310504,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibody titer', '*Horizontal transmission', '*Japanese macaques', '*Mother-to-child transmission', '*Prevalence', '*Proviral load', '*STLV-1']",,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-020-00525-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-020-00525-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2020 Jun 23;17(1):15. doi: 10.1186/s12977-020-00525-1.,"['19cm0106365s0101/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development/International', '18fk0108059h0201/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development/International']",1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2166-6015'],20210310,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*transmission/*veterinary', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Japan', 'Macaca fuscata/virology', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have reported milk EVs as novel biomarkers for many infectious diseases in both humans and animals. For example, miRNAs in milk EVs from cattle were used for early detection of bacterial infection in the mammary gland. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that mRNAs in milk EVs are suitable for gaining a better understanding of the pathogenesis of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection and prognosis of the clinical stage in cattle. For that purpose, milk EVs were isolated from BLV-infected and uninfected cattle, and mRNAs were investigated using microarray analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed mainly focusing on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in milk EVs from BLV-infected cattle. GO and KEGG analyses suggested the DEGs in milk EVs from BLV-infected cattle had involved in diverse molecular functions, biological processes, and distinct disease-related pathways. The present study suggested that BLV infection causes profound effects on host cellular activity, changing the mRNA expression profile in milk EVs obtained from BLV-infected cattle. Overall, our results suggested that the mRNA profile in milk EVs to be a key factor for monitoring the clinical stage of BLV infection.

This approval helps to demonstrate the potential role that immunotoxins can play in the cancer therapeutics pipeline. However, concerns have been raised about the use of immunotoxins, including their high immunogenicity and short half-life, in particular for treating solid tumors such as liver cancer. This review provides an overview of recent efforts to develop a glypican-3 (GPC3) targeting immunotoxin for treating HCC, including strategies to deimmunize immunotoxins by removing B- or T-cell epitopes on the bacterial toxin and to improve the serum half-life of immunotoxins by incorporating an albumin binding domain.",,"['Fleming, Bryan D', 'Ho, Mitchell']","['Fleming BD', 'Ho M']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4264, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4264, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20200620,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,PMC7356171,['NOTNLM'],"['*albumin binding domain', '*glypican-3', '*hepatocellular carcinoma', '*recombinant immunotoxin', '*single-domain antibody']",,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10060934 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10060934 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Jun 20;10(6). pii: biom10060934. doi: 10.3390/biom10060934.,"['Z01 BC010891/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC010891/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",6,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3556-0852', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9152-5405']",20210412,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Glypicans)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy', 'Glypicans/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although rare in childhood, it is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults, accounting for 80% of all cases in this age group. The prognosis of this disease remains poor (especially in childhood, as compared to acute lymphoblastic leukemia); however, overall survival has significantly improved over the past 30 years. The health of the oral cavity is a remarkable reflection of the systemic status of an individual. Identification of the signs and symptoms of oral lesions can act as a warning sign of hidden and serious systemic involvement. Moreover, they may be the presenting feature of acute leukemia and provide important diagnostic indicators. Primary oral alterations are identified in up to 90% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia and consist of petechiae, spontaneous bleeding, mucosal ulceration, gingival enlargement with or without necrosis, infections, hemorrhagic bullae on the tongue, and cracked lips. Poor oral hygiene is a well-known risk factor for local and systemic infectious complications. Oro-dental complications due to AML treatment can affect the teeth, oral mucosa, soft and bone tissue, and contribute to opportunistic infections, dental decay, and enamel discoloration. The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia is still associated with high mortality and morbidity.

However, large cohort studies on real-world data and studies on temporal trends are lacking. We performed a nationwide study on serious bacterial infections in CLL. METHODS: Using high-quality Swedish government-based registries, 13 009 CLL patients diagnosed in 1982-2013 and their 49 380 matched controls were included. RESULTS: Overall, CLL patients had an increased risk of serious inpatient bacterial infections with a hazard ratio (HR) 5.32 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5.11-5.53, and the highest risk was observed for septicemia (HR 6.91, 95% CI 6.46-7.39) and lung infections (5.91, 5.64-6.18). The risk of serious inpatient bacterial infections decreased overtime with HR 0.87 (0.81-0.94) and HR 0.76 (0.70-0.82) in 1993-2002 and 2003-2013, respectively, compared to 1982-1992. CLL patients had an increased risk of death following a serious inpatient bacterial infection compared to matched CLL patients, and the risk was highest in the first 12 months after the infection (HR 5.48, 95% CI 5.11-5.90).

The purpose of our study was to clarify the issues related to feeding options to prevent postnatal mother-to-child transmission. METHODS: Of the pregnant carriers at 92 facilities in Japan between 2012 and 2015, 735 were followed prospectively. Among the children born to them, 313 (42.6%) children were followed up to the age of 3 and tested for HTLV-1 antibodies. The mother-to-child transmission rate was calculated for each feeding option selected before birth. RESULTS: Among the 313 pregnant carriers, 55.0, 35.1, 6.1, and 3.8% selected short-term breast-feeding (</=3 months), exclusive formula feeding, frozen-thawed breast-milk feeding, and longer-term breast-feeding, respectively. Despite short-term breast-feeding, 8-18% of the mothers continued breast-feeding for 4-6 months. The mother-to-child transmission rate with short-term breast-feeding was 2.3% (4/172), and its risk ratio compared with that of exclusive formula feeding was not significantly different (0.365; 95% CI: 0.116-1.145). Because of the small number of children who were fed by frozen-thawed breast-milk, their mother-to-child transmission rate was not statistically reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant HTLV-1 carriers tended to select short-term breast-feeding in Japan. While short-term breast-feeding was not always easy to wean within 3 months, it may be a viable option for preventing postnatal mother-to-child transmission because the vertical transmission rate with short-term breast-feeding was not significantly higher than that with exclusive formula feeding. Increasing the follow-up rates for children born to pregnant carriers may provide clearer evidence of preventative effects by short-term breast-feeding and frozen-thawed breast-milk feeding.",['(c) 2020 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Itabashi, Kazuo', 'Miyazawa, Tokuo', 'Nerome, Yasuhito', 'Sekizawa, Akihiko', 'Moriuchi, Hiroyuki', 'Saito, Shigeru', 'Yonemoto, Naohiro']","['Itabashi K', 'Miyazawa T', 'Nerome Y', 'Sekizawa A', 'Moriuchi H', 'Saito S', 'Yonemoto N']","['Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University School of Health Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'The University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Neuropsychopharmacology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Kodaira, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210227,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'feeding options', 'mother-to-child transmission', 'nationwide antenatal screening', 'prevention']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.14356 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2021 Mar;63(3):284-289. doi: 10.1111/ped.14356.

Gain-of-function alterations in this component of the TCR/NF-kappaB pathway are associated with the development of HTLV-1-driven adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We aimed to determine whether inhibition of MALT-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation could have anti-ATL activity. METHODS: RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to assess expression levels of MALT-1 and the intracellular signaling cascades. Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptotic events were examined using WST-8 assays, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33342 staining. RESULTS: MALT-1 expression was upregulated in ATL-derived T-cell lines compared to that in normal PBMCs and uninfected or HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines. Targeting MALT-1 with siRNA decreased cell proliferation. A MALT-1 inhibitor (MI-2) suppressed cleavage of the MALT-1-target protein, CYLD, and inhibited proliferation via G1 phase arrest. MI-2 induced apoptosis through caspase-3/8/9 activation and inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta and IkappaBalpha, resulting in the accumulation of IkappaBalpha and suppression of NF-kappaB-DNA binding. Additionally, MI-2 inhibited the expression of apoptosis- and cell cycle-related proteins regulated by NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS: MALT-1 plays an important regulatory role in NF-kappaB signaling during ATL-genesis, and targeting MALT-1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We analyzed 1690 NHL cases and 5131 controls in the North American Pooled Project (NAPP) to investigate self-reported insecticide use and risk of NHL overall and by subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for each insecticide were estimated using logistic regression. Subtype-specific associations were evaluated using ASSET (Association analysis for SubSETs). Increased risks of multiple NHL subtypes were observed for lindane (OR = 1.60, 1.20-2.10: FL, DLCBL, SLL), chlordane (OR = 1.59, 1.17-2.16: FL, SLL) and DDT (OR = 1.36, 1.06-1.73: DLBCL, SLL). Positive trends were observed, within the subsets with identified associations, for increasing categories of exposure duration for lindane (Ptrend = 1.7 x 10(-4) ), chlordane (Ptrend = 1.0 x 10(-3) ) and DDT (Ptrend = 4.2 x 10(-3) ), however, the exposure-response relationship was nonlinear. Ever use of pyrethrum was associated with an increased risk of FL (OR = 3.65, 1.45-9.15), and the relationship with duration of use appeared monotonic (OR for >10 years: OR = 5.38, 1.75-16.53; Ptrend = 3.6 x 10(-3) ). Our analysis identified several novel associations between insecticide use and specific NHL subtypes, suggesting possible etiologic heterogeneity in the context of pesticide exposure.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

We investigated the association of area deprivation index (ADI), a measure of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, with overall survival (OS) among children and adolescents with ALL. PROCEDURE: We obtained demographic and clinical data, geocoded addresses at diagnosis, and vital status on all Texas children diagnosed with ALL from 1995 to 2011 (N = 4104). Using the US Census Bureau 2010 geography, we computed ADI scores for all census tracts in Texas and grouped the tracts into quartiles: least, third-most, second-most, and most disadvantaged. We mapped children to ADI quartiles based on residence at diagnosis, and estimated OS using Cox regression adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residence. RESULTS: Five-year OS ranged from 89% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87-91%) for children in the least disadvantaged tracts to 79% (95% CI 76-81%) for children in the most disadvantaged tracts (P = 4E-7). An elevated hazard ratio (HR) for death was observed for children in the most disadvantaged tracts (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.23-2.00), and trends toward increased mortality were observed in the third-most and second-most disadvantaged tracts (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97-1.57 and HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99-1.62, respectively). In stratified analyses, area disadvantage was more strongly associated with OS in males than females. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with inferior OS in this analysis of over 4100 children with ALL, highlighting the substantial contributions of social-environmental factors to childhood cancer survival. This association was stronger in males than females.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Schraw, Jeremy M', 'Peckham-Gregory, Erin C', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Oluyomi, Abiodun']","['Schraw JM', 'Peckham-Gregory EC', 'Rabin KR', 'Scheurer ME', 'Lupo PJ', 'Oluyomi A']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200623,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*childhood cancer', '*epidemiology', '*geographic information systems', '*health disparities']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28525 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Sep;67(9):e28525. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28525.

These proteins transduce signals via the canonical pathway, which is beta-catenin-mediated and better-characterized, or via more diverse noncanonical pathways that are beta-catenin independent and comprise the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the WNT/Ca(++) pathways. Several proteins regulate Wnt signaling through a variety of sophisticated mechanisms. Disorders within the pathway can contribute to various human diseases, and the dysregulation of Wnt pathways by different molecular mechanisms is implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of cancer, including the hematological malignancies. The types of leukemia differ considerably and can be subdivided into chronic, myeloid or lymphocytic, and acute, myeloid or lymphocytic, leukemia, according to the differentiation stage of the predominant cells, the progenitor lineage, the diagnostic age strata, and the specific molecular drivers behind their development. Here, we review the role of Wnt signaling in normal hematopoiesis and discuss in detail the multiple ways canonical Wnt signaling can be dysregulated in acute leukemia, including alterations in gene expression and protein levels, epigenetic regulation, and mutations. Furthermore, we highlight the different impacts of these alterations, considering the distinct forms of the disease, and the therapeutic potential of targeting Wnt signaling.",['(c)2020 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Soares-Lima, Sheila C', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Carneiro, Flavia R G']","['Soares-Lima SC', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Carneiro FRG']","['Epigenetics Group, Molecular Carcinogenesis Program, Brazilian National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program Research Center, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'FIOCRUZ, Center of Technological Development in Health (CDTS), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'FIOCRUZ, Laboratorio Interdisciplinar de Pesquisas Medicas-Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200623,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*BCP-ALL', '*T-ALL', '*cancer', '*beta-catenin']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/02/10 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.2MR0420-707R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2020 Oct;108(4):1081-1099. doi: 10.1002/JLB.2MR0420-707R.

How posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of RUNX1 affect its in vivo function, however, and whether PTM dysregulation of RUNX1 can cause leukemia are largely unknown. We performed targeted deep sequencing on a family with 3 occurrences of AML and identified a novel RUNX1 mutation, R237K. The mutated R237 residue is a methylation site by protein arginine methyltransferase 1, and loss of methylation reportedly impairs the transcriptional activity of RUNX1 in vitro. To explore the biologic significance of RUNX1 methylation in vivo, we used RUNX1 R233K/R237K double-mutant mice, in which 2 arginine-to-lysine mutations precluded RUNX1 methylation. Genetic ablation of RUNX1 methylation led to loss of quiescence and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and it changed the genomic and epigenomic signatures of phenotypic HSCs to a poised progenitor state. Furthermore, loss of RUNX1 R233/R237 methylation suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced unfolded protein response genes, including Atf4, Ddit3, and Gadd34; the radiation-induced p53 downstream genes Bbc3, Pmaip1, and Cdkn1a; and subsequent apoptosis in HSCs. Mechanistically, activating transcription factor 4 was identified as a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. Collectively, defects in RUNX1 methylation in HSCs confer resistance to apoptosis and survival advantage under stress conditions, a hallmark of a preleukemic clone that may predispose affected individuals to leukemia. Our study will lead to a better understanding of how dysregulation of PTMs can contribute to leukemogenesis.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Matsumura, Takayoshi', 'Nakamura-Ishizu, Ayako', 'Muddineni, Siva Sai Naga Anurag', 'Tan, Darren Qiancheng', 'Wang, Chelsia Qiuxia', 'Tokunaga, Kenji', 'Tirado-Magallanes, Roberto', 'Sian, Stephanie', 'Benoukraf, Touati', 'Okuda, Tsukasa', 'Asou, Norio', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Suda, Toshio']","['Matsumura T', 'Nakamura-Ishizu A', 'Muddineni SSNA', 'Tan DQ', 'Wang CQ', 'Tokunaga K', 'Tirado-Magallanes R', 'Sian S', 'Benoukraf T', 'Okuda T', 'Asou N', 'Matsuoka M', 'Osato M', 'Suda T']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Department of Microscopic and Developmental Anatomy, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Discipline of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61616-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004292 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Oct 22;136(17):1919-1932. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004292.,,17,,20210324,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Family', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that T cells can be reengineered to express functional ASS or OTC enzymes, in concert with different chimeric antigen receptors.

Asparaginase is an integral component in current chemotherapy for childhood BCP-ALL. Asparaginase therapy depletes serum asparagine. Normal hematopoietic cells can produce asparagine by asparagine synthetase (ASNS) activity, but ALL cells are unable to synthesize adequate amounts of asparagine. The ASNS gene has a typical CpG island in its promoter. Thus, methylation of the ASNS CpG island could be one of the epigenetic mechanisms for ASNS gene silencing in BCP-ALL. To gain deep insights into the pharmacogenomics of asparaginase therapy, we investigated the association of ASNS methylation status with asparaginase sensitivity. The ASNS CpG island is largely unmethylated in normal hematopoietic cells, but it is allele-specifically methylated in BCP-ALL cells. The ASNS gene is located at 7q21, an evolutionally conserved imprinted gene cluster. ASNS methylation in childhood BCP-ALL is associated with an aberrant methylation of the imprinted gene cluster at 7q21. Aberrant methylation of mouse Asns and a syntenic imprinted gene cluster is also confirmed in leukemic spleen samples from ETV6-RUNX1 knockin mice. In 3 childhood BCP-ALL cohorts, ASNS is highly methylated in BCP-ALL patients with favorable karyotypes but is mostly unmethylated in BCP-ALL patients with poor prognostic karyotypes. Higher ASNS methylation is associated with higher L-asparaginase sensitivity in BCP-ALL through lower ASNS gene and protein expression levels. These observations demonstrate that silencing of the ASNS gene as a result of aberrant imprinting is a pharmacogenetic mechanism for the leukemia-specific activity of asparaginase therapy in BCP-ALL.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Miyake, Kunio', 'Nordlund, Jessica', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine', 'van der Weyden, Louise', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Ikawa, Tomokatsu', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Ohara, Akira', 'Kimura, Shunsuke', 'Kubota, Yasuo', 'Takita, Junko', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Sakaguchi, Kimiyoshi', 'Minegishi, Masayoshi', 'Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Shinohara, Tamao', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Abe, Masako', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Inukai, Takeshi']","['Watanabe A', 'Miyake K', 'Nordlund J', 'Syvanen AC', 'van der Weyden L', 'Honda H', 'Yamasaki N', 'Nagamachi A', 'Inaba T', 'Ikawa T', 'Urayama KY', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Ohara A', 'Kimura S', 'Kubota Y', 'Takita J', 'Goto H', 'Sakaguchi K', 'Minegishi M', 'Iwamoto S', 'Shinohara T', 'Kagami K', 'Abe M', 'Akahane K', 'Goi K', 'Sugita K', 'Inukai T']","['Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', ""Field of Human Disease Models, Major in Advanced Life Sciences and Medicine, Institute of Laboratory Animals, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Immune Regeneration, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Social Medicine and.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Toho University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Hematology/Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Kanagawa, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Fukushima Blood Center, Fukushima, Japan; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC7702480,,,,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)79932-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004090 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Nov 12;136(20):2319-2333. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004090.,,20,,20210402,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Genomic Imprinting/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed genome-wide sequencing techniques to characterize the mutational landscape of a large and clinically well-characterized cohort including 367 adults with MDS/MPN subtypes, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n = 119), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 71), MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T; n = 71), and MDS/MPN unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U; n = 106). A total of 30 genes were recurrently mutated in >/=3% of the cohort. Distribution of recurrently mutated genes and clonal architecture differed among MDS/MPN subtypes. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between recurrently mutated genes, as well as genotype-phenotype associations. We identified specific gene combinations that were associated with distinct MDS/MPN subtypes and that were mutually exclusive with most of the other MDSs/MPNs (eg, TET2-SRSF2 in CMML, ASXL1-SETBP1 in aCML, and SF3B1-JAK2 in MDS/MPN-RS-T).

Although 80% of patients achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy, many relapse, negatively affecting overall out comes. The mechanisms underlying relapse have not been fully elucidated. This review aims to provide an overview of genetic aberrations involved in relapse of disease. A literature review on molecular mechanisms implicated in pediatric AML relapse spanning from 2003 to 2017 was conducted. PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were interrogated using relevant search terms. Of note, we examined a total of final 10 research papers from four large study groups that have utilized whole genome sequencing and molecular targeting of trio or paired samples of initial diagnosis, remission, and relapse. Their findings reveal that the genomic landscape of pediatric AML varies from diagnosis to relapse in different populations. Pediatric AML relapse is a systemic evolutionary illness accompanied by synchronized mutational hits impairing differentiation function. The irregular proliferative function is a consequence of mutations in signal transduction genes such as FLT3, RAS, PTPN11, and c-KIT and genes that code for transcription factors such as CEBPalpha, WT1, SATB1, GFI1, KLF2, and TBP are associated with relapse of disease. Identification of molecular markers unique to different stages of the disease in distinct populations can provide valuable information about disease prognosis and management.","['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Zafar, Naveera', 'Ghias, Kulsoom', 'Fadoo, Zehra']","['Zafar N', 'Ghias K', 'Fadoo Z']","['Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200623,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute', 'gene expression', 'leukemia', 'myeloid', 'pediatrics', 'recurrence']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.13367 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2021 Oct;17(5):e135-e141. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13367.

However, the cytotoxic mechanism associated with GSK3beta suppression remains unresolved. Thus, the underlying mechanism of N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-N'-(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)urea (AR-A014418)-elicited GSK3beta suppression in the induction of AML U937 and HL-60 cell death was investigated in this study. Our study revealed that AR-A014418-induced MCL1 downregulation remarkably elicited apoptosis of U937 cells. Furthermore, the AR-A014418 treatment increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and decreased the phosphorylated Akt and ERK levels. Activation of p38 MAPK subsequently evoked autophagic degradation of 4EBP1, while Akt inactivation suppressed mTOR-mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, AR-A014418-elicited ERK inactivation inhibited Mnk1-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation, which inhibited MCL1 mRNA translation in U937 cells. In contrast to GSK3alpha, GSK3beta downregulation recapitulated the effect of AR-A014418 in U937 cells. Transfection of constitutively active GSK3beta or cotransfection of constitutively activated MEK1 and Akt suppressed AR-A014418-induced MCL1 downregulation. Moreover, AR-A014418 sensitized U937 cells to ABT-263 (BCL2/BCL2L1 inhibitor) cytotoxicity owing to MCL1 suppression. Collectively, these results indicate that AR-A014418-induced GSK3beta suppression inhibits ERK-Mnk1-eIF4E axis-modulated de novo MCL1 protein synthesis and thereby results in U937 cell apoptosis. Our findings also indicate a similar pathway underlying AR-A014418-induced death in human AML HL-60 cells.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Lee YC', 'Shi YJ', 'Wang LJ', 'Chiou JT', 'Huang CH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200622,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,['NOTNLM'],"['*4EBP1 downregulation', '*GSK3beta suppression', '*MCL1 downregulation', '*eIF4E dephosphorylation', '*leukemia']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29884 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2021 Jan;236(1):570-586. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29884.

The genetic and molecular heterogeneity is also reflected by a progressive shift from a morphologic classification to one informed by causative genomic changes. Cytogenetic results and somatic mutations are increasingly being utilized to guide use of intensive chemotherapy and low-intensity chemotherapy, particularly among older adults. Utilization of next-generation sequencing in AML has led to increasing use of targeted treatments for actionable mutations. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based mutational analysis and multicolor flow cytometry offer sensitive assays that can detect minimal residual disease (MRD). Several studies have shown that MRD negativity, as defined by specified cutoff values, is highly prognostic with potential therapeutic implications. The last 3 years mark an unprecedented history in the drug development in AML with approval of 8 new drugs and large portfolio of ongoing early and late-phase trials of several promising drugs.

The CAR-T field in MM is rapidly evolving with >50 currently ongoing clinical trials across all phases, different CAR-T design, or targets. Most of the CAR-T trials are performed in China and the United States, while European centers organize or participate in only a small fraction of current clinical investigations. Autologous CAR-T cell therapy against B cell maturation antigen shows the best evidence of efficacy so far but main issues remain to be addressed: duration of response, longer follow-up, prolonged cytopenia, patients who may benefit the most such as those with extramedullary disease, outcome prediction, and the integration of CAR-T cell therapy within the MM treatment paradigm. Other promising targets are, i.a.,: CD38, SLAMF7/CS1, or GPRC5D. Although no product has been approved to date, cost and production time for autologous products are expected to be the main obstacles for broad use, for which reason allogeneic CAR-T cells are currently explored. However, the inherent risk of graft-versus-host disease requires additional modification which still need to be validated. This review aims to present the current status of CAR-T cell therapy in MM with an overview on current targets, designs, and stages of CAR-T cell development. Main challenges to CAR-T cell therapy will be highlighted as well as strategies to structurally improve the CAR-T cell product, and thereby its efficacy and safety.

Thus, effective therapy for this subset of patients would ideally include drugs that are selectively lethal in TET2-mutant HSPCs, at dosages that spare normal HSPCs. In this study, we tested 129 FDA-approved anticancer drugs in a tet2-deficient zebrafish model and showed that topoisomerase 1 (TOP1)-targeted drugs and PARP1 inhibitors selectively kill tet2-mutant HSPCs. We found that Tet2-deficient murine bone marrow progenitors and CRISPR-Cas9-induced TET2-mutant human AML cells were more sensitive to both classes of drugs compared with matched control cells. The mechanism underlying the selective killing of TET2-mutant blood cells by these drugs was due to aberrantly low levels of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), an enzyme that is important for removing TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1cc). Low TDP1 levels yield sensitivity to TOP1-targeted drugs or PARP1 inhibitors and an inability to remove TOP1 cleavage complexes, leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cell death. The finding that TET2 mutations render HSPCs uniquely vulnerable to disruption of TOP1 and PARP1 activity may therefore represent a unique opportunity to use relatively low dosages of these drugs for the ""precision therapy"" of TET2-mutant myeloid malignancies.",,"['Jing, Chang-Bin', 'Fu, Cong', 'Prutsch, Nicole', 'Wang, Meng', 'He, Shuning', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Jing CB', 'Fu C', 'Prutsch N', 'Wang M', 'He S', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology and the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. thomas_look@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200622,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2020/06/24 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0927-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0927-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Nov;34(11):2992-3006. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0927-5.

RUNX1, a well-known transcription factor for T-cell differentiation, has recently been described to act in addition as a recombinase cofactor for TCRdelta gene rearrangements. In this work we employed a RUNX1 knock-out mouse model and demonstrate by deep TCRbeta sequencing, immunostaining and chromatin immunoprecipitation that RUNX1 binds to the initiation site of TCRbeta rearrangement and its homozygous inactivation induces severe structural changes of the rearranged TCRbeta gene, whereas heterozygous inactivation has almost no impact. To compare the mouse model results to the situation in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) we analyzed TCRbeta gene rearrangements in T-ALL samples harboring heterozygous Runx1 mutations. Comparable to the Runx1(+/-) mouse model, heterozygous Runx1 mutations in T-ALL patients displayed no detectable impact on TCRbeta rearrangements. Furthermore, we reanalyzed published sequence data from recurrent deletion borders of ALL patients carrying an ETV6-RUNX1 translocation. RUNX1 motifs were significantly overrepresented at the deletion ends arguing for a role of RUNX1 in the deletion mechanism. Collectively, our data imply a role of RUNX1 as recombinase cofactor for both physiological and aberrant deletions.",,"['Seitz, V', 'Kleo, K', 'Droge, A', 'Schaper, S', 'Elezkurtaj, S', 'Bedjaoui, N', 'Dimitrova, L', 'Sommerfeld, A', 'Berg, E', 'von der Wall, E', 'Muller, U', 'Joosten, M', 'Lenze, D', 'Heimesaat, M M', 'Baldus, C', 'Zinser, C', 'Cieslak, A', 'Macintyre, E', 'Stocking, C', 'Hennig, S', 'Hummel, M']","['Seitz V', 'Kleo K', 'Droge A', 'Schaper S', 'Elezkurtaj S', 'Bedjaoui N', 'Dimitrova L', 'Sommerfeld A', 'Berg E', 'von der Wall E', 'Muller U', 'Joosten M', 'Lenze D', 'Heimesaat MM', 'Baldus C', 'Zinser C', 'Cieslak A', 'Macintyre E', 'Stocking C', 'Hennig S', 'Hummel M']","['Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'HS Diagnomics GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'HS Diagnomics GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'HS Diagnomics GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', ""University of Paris, Institute Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), INSERM U1151, Laboratoire d'Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France."", 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz-Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Berlin, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Department of Internal Medicine II, Kiel, Germany.', 'Precigen Bioinformatics Germany GmbH, Munich, Germany.', ""University of Paris, Institute Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), INSERM U1151, Laboratoire d'Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France."", ""University of Paris, Institute Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), INSERM U1151, Laboratoire d'Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France."", 'University Medical Center Eppendorf, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Hamburg, Germany.', 'HS Diagnomics GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine Berlin, Institute of Pathology, Berlin, Germany. michael.hummel@charite.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200622,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC7308335,,,,2020/06/24 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-65744-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-65744-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jun 22;10(1):10024. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-65744-0.,,1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1015-9448'],20201210,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymus Gland/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analogy is still apt today; however, we now realize that cancer is a much more formidable enemy than scientists originally perceived, and in some cases, it harbors a profound ability to thwart our best efforts to defeat it. However, before we were aware of the complexity of cancer, chemotherapy against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was successful because it applied the principles of pharmacology. Herein, we provide a historic perspective of the experience at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In 1962, when the hospital opened, fewer than 3% of patients experienced durable cure. Through judicious application of pharmacologic principles (e.g., combination therapy with agents using different mechanisms of action) plus appropriate drug scheduling, dosing, and pharmacodynamics, the survival of patients with ALL now exceeds 90%. We contrast this approach to treating ALL with the contemporary approach to treating medulloblastoma, in which genetics and molecular signatures are being used to guide the development of more-efficacious treatment strategies with minimal toxicity. Finally, we highlight the emerging technologies that can sustain and propel the collaborative efforts to squeeze the life out of these cancers. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Up until the early 1960s, chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was mostly ineffective. This changed with the knowledge and implementation of rational approaches to combination therapy. Although the therapeutics of brain cancers such as medulloblastoma are not as refined (in part because of the blood-brain barrier obstacle), recent extraordinary advances in knowledge of medulloblastoma pathobiology has led to innovations in disease classification accompanied with strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. Undoubtedly, additional novel approaches, such as immunological therapeutics, will open new avenues to further the goal of taming cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Wijaya, Juwina', 'Gose, Tomoka', 'Schuetz, John D']","['Wijaya J', 'Gose T', 'Schuetz JD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee John.schuetz@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Pharmacol Rev,Pharmacological reviews,0421737,PMC7312347,,,,2020/06/24 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['72/3/668 [pii]', '10.1124/pr.118.016824 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rev. 2020 Jul;72(3):668-691. doi: 10.1124/pr.118.016824.,"['P01 CA096832/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",3,,20201006,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Medulloblastoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No standard treatment options are available, and it remains an unmet clinical need. Here, we report a case of a tandem allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) performed in a patient who did not achieve remission after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy. METHODS CASE REPORT: The treatment was approved by the Bioethical Commission of the Medical University of Warsaw and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The patient gave informed consent. RESULTS: A 41-year-old woman was diagnosed with AML, high cytogenetic risk, with concomitant skin and central nervous system involvement, bone marrow necrosis, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. She received ""3+7"" induction and HAM (cytarabine, mitoxantrone) reinduction, after which she did not achieve remission and hematopoietic recovery. Tandem allo-HSCT was performed from the same HLA-identical brother---the first after reduced intensity conditioning (cladribine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone, melphalan) and the second after myeloablative conditioning (BuCy--busulphan, cyclophosphamide).

However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Applying contemporary diagnostic methods, CNS disease is often underdiagnosed. To explore more sensitive and less invasive CNS status indicators, we examined microRNA (miR) expressions and extracellular vesicle (EV) characteristics. METHODS: In an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) discovery cohort, 47 miRs were screened using Custom TaqMan Advanced Low-Density Array gene expression cards. As a validation step, a candidate miR family was further scrutinized with TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays on serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood samples with different acute leukemia subtypes. Furthermore, small EV-rich fractions were isolated from CSF and the samples were processed for immunoelectron microscopy with anti-CD63 and anti-CD81 antibodies, simultaneously. RESULTS: Regarding the discovery study, principal component analysis identified the role of miR-181-family (miR-181a-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-181c-5p) in clustering CNS-positive (CNS(+)) and CNS-negative (CNS()) CSF samples. We were able to validate miR-181a expression differences: it was about 52 times higher in CSF samples of CNS(+) ALL patients compared to CNS() cases (n = 8 vs. n = 10, DeltaFC = 52.30, p = 1.5E-4), and CNS(+) precursor B cell subgroup also had ninefold higher miR-181a levels in their BM (p = 0.04). The sensitivity of CSF miR-181a measurement in ALL highly exceeded those of conventional cytospin in the initial diagnosis of CNS leukemia (90% vs. 54.5%). Pellet resulting from ultracentrifugation of CNS(+) CSF samples of ALL patients showed atypical CD63(-)/CD81(-) small EVs in high density by immunoelectron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: After validating in extensive cohorts, quantification of miR-181a or a specific EV subtype might provide novel tools to monitor CNS disease course and further adjust CNS-directed therapy in pediatric ALL.",,"['Egyed, Balint', 'Kutszegi, Nora', 'Sagi, Judit C', 'Gezsi, Andras', 'Rzepiel, Andrea', 'Visnovitz, Tamas', 'Lorincz, Peter', 'Muller, Judit', 'Zombori, Marianna', 'Szalai, Csaba', 'Erdelyi, Daniel J', 'Kovacs, Gabor T', 'Semsei, Agnes F']","['Egyed B', 'Kutszegi N', 'Sagi JC', 'Gezsi A', 'Rzepiel A', 'Visnovitz T', 'Lorincz P', 'Muller J', 'Zombori M', 'Szalai C', 'Erdelyi DJ', 'Kovacs GT', 'Semsei AF']","['2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto Str, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, 4 Nagyvarad Sqr, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto Str, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, 4 Nagyvarad Sqr, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Immune-Proteogenomics Extracellular Vesicle Research Group, Semmelweis University, 4 Nagyvarad Sqr, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', 'Department of Measurements and Information Systems, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, 2 Magyar tudosok korutja, Budapest, 1117, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto Str, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, 4 Nagyvarad Sqr, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell and Developmental Biology, Eotvos Lorand University, 1/c Pazmany Promenade, Budapest, 1117, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto Str, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', 'Heim Pal National Pediatric Institute, 86 Ulloi Str, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, 4 Nagyvarad Sqr, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', 'Heim Pal National Pediatric Institute, 86 Ulloi Str, Budapest, 1089, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto Str, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto Str, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, 4 Nagyvarad Sqr, Budapest, 1089, Hungary. semsei.agnes@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200622,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,PMC7310470,['NOTNLM'],"['*Central nervous system involvement', '*Liquid biopsy', '*Pediatric leukemia', '*Small extracellular vesicles', '*microRNA-based biomarker']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-020-02415-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-020-02415-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2020 Jun 22;18(1):250. doi: 10.1186/s12967-020-02415-8.,,1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8709-2459'],20210514,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Central Nervous System', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Liquid Biopsy', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While few studies have focused on HOXA10 in AML. We aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of HOXA10. METHODS: We downloaded datasets from GEO and BeatAML database, to compare HOXA expression level between AML patients and controls. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the impact of HOXA10 expression on AML survival. The differentially expressed genes, miRNAs, lncRNAs and methylated regions between HOXA10-high and -low groups were obtained using R (version 3.6.0). Accordingly, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was accomplished using MSigDB database. Moreover, the regulatory TFs/microRNAs/lncRNAs of HOXA10 were identified. A LASSO-Cox model fitted OS to clinical and HOXA10-associated genetic variables by glmnet package. RESULTS: HOXA10 was overexpressed in AML patients than that in controls. The HOXA10-high group is significantly associated with shorter OS and DFS. A total of 1219 DEGs, 131 DEmiRs, 282 DElncRs were identified to be associated with HOXA10. GSEA revealed that 12 suppressed and 3 activated pathways in HOXA10-high group. Furthermore, the integrated regulatory network targeting HOXA10 was established. The LASSO-Cox model fitted OS to AML-survival risk scores, which included age, race, molecular risk, expression of IKZF2/LINC00649/LINC00839/FENDRR and has-miR-424-5p. The time dependent ROC indicated a satisfying AUC (1-year AUC 0.839, 3-year AUC 0.871 and 5-year AUC 0.813). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified HOXA10 overexpression as an adverse prognostic factor for AML.

The main role of SASP in physiological conditions is to attract immune cells to clear senescent cells avoiding tumor development. However, senescence can be damage-associated and, depending on the nature of these stimuli, additional types of senescence have been described. In the context of cancer, damage-associated senescence has been described as a consequence of chemotherapy treatments that were initially thought of as a tumor suppressor mechanism. However, in certain contexts, senescence after chemotherapy can promote cancer progression, especially when immune cells become senescent and cannot clear senescent tumor cells. Moreover, aging itself leads to continuous inflammaging and immunosenescence which are responsible for rewiring immune cells to become defective in their functionality. Here, we define different types of senescence, pathways that activate them, and functions of SASP in these events. Additionally, we describe the role of senescence in cancer and its treatments, including how aging and chemotherapy contribute to senescence in tumor cells, before focusing on immune cell senescence and its role in cancer. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic interventions to reverse cell senescence.",,"['Battram, Anthony M', 'Bachiller, Mireia', 'Martin-Antonio, Beatriz']","['Battram AM', 'Bachiller M', 'Martin-Antonio B']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS/Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Carrer Rossello 149-153, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200618,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7352478,['NOTNLM'],"['SASP', 'immunotherapy', 'inflammaging', 'senescence', 'senescence surveillance']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2021/02/16 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21124346 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21124346 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 18;21(12). pii: ijms21124346. doi: 10.3390/ijms21124346.,,12,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9179-0639', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6153-4722', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0612-2693']",20210215,,IM,"['Cellular Senescence', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the anti-neoplastic effects of the nuclear NOTCH2 inhibitor gliotoxin and the pan-NOTCH gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in primary CLL cells with special emphasis on the individual roles of the different NOTCH receptors. Gliotoxin rapidly induced apoptosis in all CLL cases tested, whereas RO4929097 exerted a variable and delayed effect on CLL cell viability. Gliotoxin-induced apoptosis was associated with inhibition of the NOTCH2/FCER2 (CD23) axis together with concomitant upregulation of the NOTCH3/NR4A1 axis. In contrast, RO4929097 downregulated the NOTCH3/NR4A1 axis and counteracted the spontaneous and gliotoxin-induced apoptosis. On the cell surface, NOTCH3 and CD23 expression were mutually exclusive, suggesting that downregulation of NOTCH2 signaling is a prerequisite for NOTCH3 expression in CLL cells. ATAC-seq confirmed that gliotoxin targeted the canonical NOTCH signaling, as indicated by the loss of chromatin accessibility at the potential NOTCH/CSL site containing the gene regulatory elements. This was accompanied by a gain in accessibility at the NR4A1, NFkappaB, and ATF3 motifs close to the genes involved in B-cell activation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In summary, these data show that gliotoxin recovers a non-canonical tumor-suppressing NOTCH3 activity, indicating that nuclear NOTCH2 inhibitors might be beneficial compared to pan-NOTCH inhibitors in the treatment of CLL.",,"['Hubmann, Rainer', 'Schnabl, Susanne', 'Araghi, Mohammad', 'Schmidl, Christian', 'Rendeiro, Andre F', 'Hilgarth, Martin', 'Demirtas, Dita', 'Ali, Farghaly', 'Staber, Philipp

Symbolic play could be a useful way to cope with these difficulties. The main aim of this paper is to assess pretend play, coping, and psychological symptoms in three groups of school-aged children with pediatric chronic diseases. The study involved 44 Italian school-aged, chronically ill children: 16 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 12 with cystic fibrosis (CF), and 15 with Leukemia. All patients were assessed by the Affect in Play Scale-Brief version (APS-Br), and the Children's Coping Strategies Checklist-Revision1 (CCSC-R1). Children with T1DM and CF also completed the Separation Anxiety Symptom Inventory for Children (SASI-C) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)-children's version. Cohen's d (effect size) was applied between clinical and normative samples, and it showed a more organized play (APS-BR), but a more negative affect tone, comfort, and frequency of affect expression. Comparing APS-BR and CCSC-R1 rates between the three groups, significant differences were found for all the APS-BR dimensions, except for tone, and for CCSC-R1 seeking understanding. Comparing SASI-C score between T1DM and CF, higher scores were found for children with CF. In the end, correlations between all dimensions highlighted several relationships between play, coping, and adjustment problems for children with T1DM, and relationship between affect play and all variables for children with CF. Symbolic play helps chronically ill children to express emotions; helping them, as well as clinicians, to understand the difficulties caused by chronic conditions, and to cope with them.",,"['Di Riso, Daniela', 'Cambrisi, Elena', 'Bertini, Simone', 'Miscioscia, Marina']","['Di Riso D', 'Cambrisi E', 'Bertini S', 'Miscioscia M']","['Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Hospital-University of Padua, 35128 Padova, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200618,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,PMC7345351,['NOTNLM'],"['*Affect in Play Scale-Brief (APS-Br)', '*coping', '*cystic fibrosis', '*leukemia', '*psychological adjustment', '*separation anxiety', '*type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)']",,2020/06/24 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2020/06/24 06:00'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17124364 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17124364 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Jun 18;17(12). pii: ijerph17124364. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17124364.,,12,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4218-1068'],20201005,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Child', '*Chronic Disease/psychology', '*Cystic Fibrosis/psychology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/psychology', '*Emotions', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/psychology', '*Play and Playthings', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent promising progress, the prognosis of acute leukemia patients remains to be improved. New therapies are therefore still needed. Salmonella typhimurium has been shown to be highly effective as an anti-tumor agent in many solid cancer models, but it has not been applied in acute leukemia. Here, we report an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain, VNP20009, can induce apoptosis in multiple types of leukemia cells both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, VNP20009 significantly inhibited the proliferation of MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia cells and prolonged the survival of the AML-carrying mice. VNP20009 restored the counts of white blood cell (WBC) and its five subsets in peripheral blood (PB) to near-physiological values, and elevated the levels of certain cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand-10 (CXCL-10) and C-C motif ligand-2 (CCL-2). Moreover, the ratio of immune cells, including natural killer cells (NKs), CD4(+) Th1-type cells and CD8(+) IFN-gamma-producing effector T cells were highly upregulated in the AML mice treated with VNP20009.

Chemoresistance presents as a major burden for therapy of AML patients. p53 is the most important tumor suppressor protein that regulates cellular response to various stress. It is also important for hematopoietic stem cell development and hematopoiesis. Mutation or deletion of TP53 has been found to be linked to cancer progression, therapy-related resistance, and poor prognosis. TP53 mutation occurs in less than 10% of AML patients; however, it represents a subset of AML with therapy resistance and poor outcome. In addition, there is a subgroup of patients with low-frequency TP53 mutations. The percentage ranges from 1% to 3% of all AML patients. These patients have outcomes comparable to those of the high-frequency TP53 mutation patients. TP53-mutated clones isolated from the parental cells exhibit a survival advantage under drug treatment compared with cells with wild-type TP53, and have a higher population of leukemia stem cell (LSC) marker-positive cells, a characteristic of chemo-resistant cells. Therefore, low-frequency TP53 mutation, which is currently underappreciated, is an important prognosis factor for AML patients. Epigenetic drugs, such as hypomethylating agent and histone deacetylase inhibitors, have been found effective in targeting TP53-mutated AML. Histone deacetylase inhibitors can preferentially target the TP53-mutated subpopulation by reactivating p53-targeted genes and by eradicating LSC marker-positive cells. Therefore, combined treatment with epigenetic drugs may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatments of TP53-mutated AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

This signal can affect the clinical course of malignant disease. Although CD47 and SIRPalpha expression are associated with clinicopathological features in several neoplasms, the investigation for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has not been well-documented. This study aimed to declare the association between CD47 and SIRPalpha expression and clinicopathological features in ATLL. We performed immunostaining on 73 biopsy samples and found that CD47 is primarily expressed in tumor cells, while SIRPalpha is expressed in non-neoplastic stromal cells. CD47 positive cases showed significantly higher FoxP3 (P = .0232) and lower CCR4 (P = .0214). SIRPalpha positive cases presented significantly better overall survival than SIRPalpha negative cases (P = .0132). SIRPalpha positive cases showed significantly HLA class I (P = .0062), HLA class II (P = .0133), microenvironment PD-L1 (miPD-L1) (P = .0032), and FoxP3 (P = .0229) positivity. In univariate analysis, SIRPalpha expression was significantly related to prognosis (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.470; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.253-0.870; P = .0167], although multivariate analysis did not show SIPRalpha as an independent prognostic factor. The expression of SIRPalpha on stromal cells reflects activated immune surveillance mechanism in tumor microenvironment and induce good prognosis in ATLL.

Relapsed disease has a poor prognosis despite the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+ ALL) cases and immunotherapeutic approaches, including blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Targeting aberrant cell survival pathways with selective small molecule BH3-mimetic inhibitors of BCL-2 (venetoclax, S55746), BCL-XL (A1331852), or MCL1 (S63845) is an emerging therapeutic option. We report that combined targeting of BCL-2 and MCL1 is synergistic in B-ALL in vitro. The combination demonstrated greater efficacy than standard chemotherapeutics and TKIs in primary samples from adult B-ALL with Ph+ ALL, Ph-like ALL, and other B-ALL. Moreover, combined BCL-2 or MCL1 inhibition with dasatinib showed potent killing in primary Ph+ B-ALL cases, but the BH3-mimetic combination appeared superior in vitro in a variety of Ph-like ALL samples. In PDX models, combined BCL-2 and MCL1 targeting eradicated ALL from Ph- and Ph+ B-ALL cases, although fatal tumor lysis was observed in some instances of high tumor burden. We conclude that a dual BH3-mimetic approach is highly effective in diverse models of high-risk human B-ALL and warrants assessment in clinical trials that incorporate tumor lysis precautions.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Moujalled, Donia M', 'Hanna, Diane T', 'Hediyeh-Zadeh, Soroor', 'Pomilio, Giovanna', 'Brown, Lauren', 'Litalien, Veronique', 'Bartolo, Ray', 'Fleming, Shaun', 'Chanrion, Maia', 'Banquet, Sebastien', 'Maragno, Ana-Leticia', 'Kraus-Berthier, Laurence', 'Schoumacher, Marie', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Georgiou, Angela', 'White, Christine A', 'Lessene, Guillaume', 'Huang, David C S', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Geneste, Olivier', 'Rasmussen, Lorna', 'Davis, Melissa J', 'Ekert, Paul G', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Ng, Ashley P', 'Khaw, Seong L']","['Moujalled DM', 'Hanna DT', 'Hediyeh-Zadeh S', 'Pomilio G', 'Brown L', 'Litalien V', 'Bartolo R', 'Fleming S', 'Chanrion M', 'Banquet S', 'Maragno AL', 'Kraus-Berthier L', 'Schoumacher M', 'Mullighan CG', 'Georgiou A', 'White CA', 'Lessene G', 'Huang DCS', 'Roberts AW', 'Geneste O', 'Rasmussen L', 'Davis MJ', 'Ekert PG', 'Wei A', 'Ng AP', 'Khaw SL']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', ""The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Suresnes, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Suresnes, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Suresnes, France.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia;

We evaluated a novel, fully automated ex vivo DSS platform that uses high-throughput flow cytometry in 54 patients with newly diagnosed or treatment-refractory myeloid neoplasms to evaluate sensitivity (blast cytotoxicity and differentiation) to 74 US Food and Drug Administration-approved or investigational drugs and 36 drug combinations. After piloting the platform in 33 patients, we conducted a prospective feasibility study enrolling 21 patients refractory to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) to determine whether this assay could be performed within a clinically actionable time frame and could accurately predict clinical responses in vivo. When assayed for cytotoxicity, ex vivo drug sensitivity patterns were heterogeneous, but they defined distinct patient clusters with differential sensitivity to HMAs, anthracyclines, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and kinase inhibitors (P < .001 among clusters) and demonstrated synergy between HMAs and venetoclax (P < .01 for combinations vs single agents). In our feasibility study, ex vivo DSS results were available at a median of 15 days after bone marrow biopsy, and they informed personalized therapy, which frequently included venetoclax combinations, kinase inhibitors, differentiative agents, and androgens. In 21 patients with available ex vivo and in vivo clinical response data, the DSS platform had a positive predictive value of 0.92, negative predictive value of 0.82, and overall accuracy of 0.85.

Any new therapeutic approach must satisfy three requirements: 1) Prevent GVHD, 2) Maintain anti-pathogen immunity, and 3) Maintain anti-tumor immunity. In prior studies we have shown that the selective photosensitizer 2-Se-Cl eliminates highly alloreactive lymphocytes from the graft prior to HCT preventing GVHD and that antiviral immune responses were preserved following incubation with 2-Se-Cl. In this report, we investigated whether 2-Se-Cl treatment preserves antitumor immunity, and then used high dimensional flow cytometry to identify the determinants of successful immune reconstitution. Donor C57BL/6 splenocytes were cocultured for 4 days with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes and then exposed to 2-Se-Cl. Photodepletion (PD)-treated splenocytes were then infused into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice inoculated with A20 leukemia/lymphoma cells. Recipient mice that received PD-treated splenocytes survived > 100 days without evidence of GVHD or leukemia. In contrast, mice that did not receive PD-treated cells at time of HCT died of leukemia progression. Multiparameter flow cytometry of cytokines and surface markers on peripheral blood samples 15 days after HCT demonstrated unique patterns of immune reconstitution. We found that before clinical disease onset GVHD was marked by functionally exhausted T cells, while tumor clearance and long-term survival were associated with an expansion of polyfunctional T cells, monocytes, and DCs early after transplantation. Taken together these results demonstrate that 2-Se-Cl photodepletion is a new treatment that can facilitate HCT by preventing GVHD while preserving antiviral and anti-tumor immunity.",,"['Grayson, Jason M', 'Perez, Mildred D', 'Blevins, Rebecca', 'Coe, Benjamin N', 'Detty, Michael R', 'McIver, Zachariah A']","['Grayson JM', 'Perez MD', 'Blevins R', 'Coe BN', 'Detty MR', 'McIver ZA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200622,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC7307732,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/06/23 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0234778 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-08593 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jun 22;15(6):e0234778. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0234778. eCollection 2020.,"['P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR001421/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",6,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4524-1601'],20200908,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Selenium Compounds)', '0 (selenium monochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', 'Selenium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same holds true in the aging people with hemophilia (PwH). Furthermore, cancer is an important challenge for physicians working in multidisciplinary hemophilia care centers. AIM: Here, the authors report 7 hemophiliacs with malignancies diagnosed and managed at our center. STUDY DESIGN: Hemophilia A and B were included. METHOD: Patients with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia A or B, who were followed-up in our center between January 1999 and December 2018 were included in the study. A total of 470 PwH (391 Hemophilia A and 79 Hemophilia B) were followed in this time period. RESULTS: With a minimum 1 and maximum 20 years (median: 11.5 y) of the following time, 7 of 470 (1.48%) PwH were diagnosed with cancer. The diagnosed cancer types were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, thyroid cancer, rectum cancer, malign melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. All patients except patients with leukemia had major surgical intervention and the hemostasis control was provided on the basis of institutional protocols. At the end of the study, all of the patients were alive besides the patient with acute myeloid leukemia.

Tryptophan is a necessary amino acid for activating cell growth and metabolism. Additionally, the insufficiency of Tryptophan can lead to immune system dysfunction. Raising the level of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase protein can promote stagnation and apoptosis of effector T cells [2].In contrast, the decline in the number of effect T cells naturally protects cancer cells from attack. Therefore, Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase is a potential target for tumour immunotherapy, such as melanoma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, leukaemia, and so on, especially in solid tumours [3]. In the study, we have done sets of virtual screening aided by computer techniques in order to find potentially effective inhibitors of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase. Firstly, screening based on structure was carried out by Libdock. Then, ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity prediction were also analyzed. Molecular docking and 3D-QSAR pharmacophore generation were used to study the mechanism of these compounds and Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase's binding. A molecular dynamic analysis was carried out to assess if these potential compound's binding is stable enough. According to the results of the analysis above, two potential compounds (ZINC000012495022 and ZINC000003791817) from the ZINC database were discovered to interact with Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase with appropriate energy and proved to be none toxic.

This study examined the antioxidant and cytotoxic potential of 35 samples (extracts/fractions) from 12 Caatinga species and determined the antiproliferative and genotoxic action of dichloromethane fraction from Mimosa caesalpiniifolia stem bark (DC-Mca) on human and vegetal cells. Samples were assessed for chemopreventive ability, toxic effects on Artemia salina shrimp as well as cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and erythrocytes. DC-Mca was also tested with respect to antiproliferative and genotoxic effects upon normal leukocytes and meristematic cells from A. cepa roots. Some extracts reduced free radical levels >95% and 7 samples exhibited a lethal concentration (LC) 50 < 100 microg/ml upon Artemia salina larvae. Eight samples displayed in vitro antitumor effects and three produced hemolysis. Data also demonstrated the pharmacological significance of bioactive extracts from Brazilian semi-arid region. There was no significant relationship between antioxidant, toxic, and antiproliferative activities, and that these properties were dependent upon the extractant. DC-Mca contained betulinic acid as main compound (approximately 70%), which showed higher (1) cytotoxic activity on cancer cell lines and dividing leukocytes, (2) reduced mitotic index of Allium cepa roots, and (3) induced cell cycle arrest and chromosomal bridges, thereby providing native promising sources for phytotherapy development.

Here, we show the broader utility of nimbolide as an E3 ligase recruiter for TPD applications. We demonstrate that a PROTAC linking nimbolide to the kinase and BCR-ABL fusion oncogene inhibitor dasatinib, BT1, selectively degrades BCR-ABL over c-ABL in leukemia cancer cells, compared to previously reported cereblon or VHL-recruiting BCR-ABL degraders that show opposite selectivity or, in some cases, inactivity.

However, the robustness and reproducibility of the manufacturing process remains a challenge. Here, a single-use 24-well microbioreactor (micro-Matrix) was assessed for its use as a high-throughput screening tool to investigate the effect and the interaction of different shaking speeds, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH levels on the growth and differentiation of primary T cells in a perfusion-mimic process. The full factorial design allowed for the generation of predictive models, which were used to find optimal culture conditions. Agitation was shown to play a fundamental role in the proliferation of T cells. A shaking speed of 200 rpm drastically improved the final viable cell concentration (VCC), while the viability was maintained above 90% throughout the cultivation. VCCs reached a maximum of 9.22 x 10(6) cells/ml. The distribution of CD8+ central memory T cells (TCM ), was found to be largely unaffected by the shaking speed. A clear interaction between pH and DO (p < .001) was established for the cell growth and the optimal culture conditions were identified for a combination of 200 rpm, 25% DO, and pH of 7.4.

The present study aims to investigate whether donor natural killer (NK) cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene modification exert anti-relapse effects on AHSCT after establishing a mouse model of AL. METHODS: C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were selected as donor mice to obtain NK cells and hematopoietic stem cells, while BALB/c (H-2d) mice were selected as the recipient mice for AHSCT. The AHSCT-treated mice were then injected with the donor NK cells, recombinant adenovirus expressing IL-2 (AdIL-2), or the NK cells infected by AdIL-2. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the cell transplantation rate, immune cell number, and cell immunogenicity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify the secretion of IL-2 in spleen cells, and the level of peripheral blood factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-35, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and IL-10. RESULTS: In our experiments, promotional effects of NK cells and AdIL-2 were found on cell transplantation rate, immune reconstitution ability, cell immunogenicity, IL-2 secretion, as well as increased peripheral blood factor levels in the recipient mice treated with AHSCT, with improved pathological changes observed. Moreover, the aforementioned changes were further promoted in the AHSCT-treated recipient mice injected with the AdIL-2-infected NK cells.

In recent years, miRNAs have been under investigation for their potential as non-invasive biomarkers in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We investigated whether miR-638 in circulating leukaemia cells is a non-invasive biomarker in diagnosis, assessment of the treatment response and minimal residual disease (MRD) surveillance of APL. METHODS: Sixty cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), including 30 cases of APL and 30 cases of non-APL AML, were selected. Thirty healthy controls were also selected. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from APL patients at diagnosis and post-induction. Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed for miRNA profiling and miR-638 expression analysis, respectively. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Spearman's rho correlation test were used. RESULTS: Both microarray and qRT-PCR data showed that miR-638 was significantly upregulated in BM after APL patients received induction therapy. Moreover, miR-638, which is specifically downregulated in APL cell lines, was upregulated after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced myeloid differentiation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses revealed that miR-638 could serve as a valuable biomarker for differentiating APL from controls or non-APL AML. Furthermore, miR-638 expression was sharply increased after induction therapy and complete remission (CR). An inverse correlation was observed between miR-638 and PML-RARalpha transcripts levels in BM samples, while a positive correlation was revealed between PB miR-638 and BM miR-638 levels in APL patients after induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that miR-638 may serve as a potential APL biomarker for diagnosis and assessment of the response to targeted therapy, and PB miR-638 could be used for non-invasive MRD surveillance in APL.",,"['Bai, Yuanyuan', 'Chen, Cheng', 'Guo, Xiaoling', 'Ding, Ting', 'Yang, Xinyun', 'Yu, Jian', 'Yang, Junjun', 'Ruan, Jichen', 'Zheng, Xiaoqun', 'Chen, Zhanguo']","['Bai Y', 'Chen C', 'Guo X', 'Ding T', 'Yang X', 'Yu J', 'Yang J', 'Ruan J', 'Zheng X', 'Chen Z']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Center of Scientific Research, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'The Second School of Medicine, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'The Second School of Medicine, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukaemia', 'miR-638', 'minimal residual disease', 'non-invasive biomarker', 'treatment response']",,2020/06/23 06:00,2021/06/09 06:00,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM190899 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-190899 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;29(1):125-137. doi: 10.3233/CBM-190899.,,1,,20210608,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN638 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression ADCYs in AML and their effect on prognosis was analyzed using data from Oncomine, GEPIA and cBioPortal databases. Frequently altered neighbor genes (FANGs) of ADCYs were detected using the 3D Genome Browser, after which the functions of these FANGs were predicted using Metascape tools. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and Annexin V-FITC/PI kits. Expression levels of ADCYs were higher in AML cells lines and in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells from AML patients than in control cells, and were predictive of a poor prognosis. A total of 58 ADCY FANGs were identified from the topologically associating domains on the basis of the Hi-C data. Functional analysis of these FANGs revealed abnormal activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Drug sensitivity tests showed that fasudil plus trametinib or sapanisertib had a synergistic effect suppressing AML cell viability and increasing apoptosis. These findings suggest that dysregulation of ADCY expression leads to altered signaling in the MAPK pathway in AML and that the ADCY expression profile may be predictive of prognosis in AML patients.",,"['Chen, Si-Liang', 'Hu, Fang', 'Wang, Da-Wei', 'Qin, Zhe-Yuan', 'Liang, Yang', 'Dai, Yu-Jun']","['Chen SL', 'Hu F', 'Wang DW', 'Qin ZY', 'Liang Y', 'Dai YJ']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200622,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC7343484,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D genome', '*ADCYs factors', '*AML', '*MAPK signaling pathway', '*prognostic value']",,2020/06/23 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['103357 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.103357 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Jun 22;12(12):11864-11877. doi: 10.18632/aging.103357.

Unsurprisingly, a variety of microfluidic platforms have been developed in recent years to study the deformability of cells, most commonly employing pure shear or extensional flows, with and without direct contact of the cells with channel walls. Herein, we investigate the effects of shear and extensional flow components on fluid-induced cell deformation by means of three microchannel geometries. In the case of hyperbolic microchannels, cell deformation takes place in a flow with constant extensional rate, under non-zero shear conditions. A sudden expansion at the microchannel terminus allows one to evaluate shape recovery subsequent to deformation. Comparison with other microchannel shapes, that induce either pure shear (straight channel) or pure extensional (cross channel) flows, reveals different deformation modes. Such an analysis is used to confirm the softening and stiffening effects of common treatments, such as cytochalasin D and formalin on cell deformability. In addition to an experimental analysis of leukaemia cell deformability, computational fluid dynamic simulations are used to deconvolve the role of the aforementioned flow components in the cell deformation dynamics. In general terms, the current study can be used as a guide for extracting deformation/recovery dynamics of leukaemia cell lines when exposed to various fluid dynamic conditions.",,"['Piergiovanni, Monica', 'Galli, Valeria', 'Holzner, Gregor', 'Stavrakis, Stavros', 'DeMello, Andrew', 'Dubini, Gabriele']","['Piergiovanni M', 'Galli V', 'Holzner G', 'Stavrakis S', 'DeMello A', 'Dubini G']","['Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics (LaBS), Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering ""Giulio Natta"", Politecnico di Milano, piazza Leonardo da Vinci, 32 - 20133 Milan, Italy. monica.piergiovanni@polimi.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,,,,2020/06/23 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0lc00166j [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2020 Jul 14;20(14):2539-2548. doi: 10.1039/d0lc00166j.,,14,,20210621,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Microfluidics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 84 patients with AML and confirmed of CNSL from January 2010 to September 2019 were selected and underwent MRI scan. We retrospectively analyzed their MRI findings, summarized the imaging features of AML central infiltration, and assessed the guiding significance of MRI on diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Results: A total of 52 patients (61.90%, 52/84) had abnormal MRI findings, of which 31 cases clearly indicated intracranial infiltration of leukemia. Among the 31 patients, the most common site of infiltration is parenchyma (19/31). Most MRI of these patients showed multiple lesions with low T1 signal and high T2 signal, which were more obvious on enhanced scan. Sensitivity of MRI in diagnosing AML central infiltration was 36.90%. Despite of its low sensitivity, it still had superior diagnostic value on some patients with false-negative CSF. The median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) time of patients with MRI clearly indicated central invasion were 4 and 9 months, respectively. But there was no significant difference in survival analysis compared with MRI negative patients (including abnormal but non-invasive). Conclusion: MRI manifestation of central infiltration in AML patients has certain characteristic findings, which is helpful to improve the diagnostic efficiency.

Aberrant Notch activation underlies more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); accordingly, chemicals disrupting Notch signaling are of potential to treat Notch-dependent cancer. Here, we developed a flow cytometry-based high-throughput assay to identify compounds that disrupt the interactions of DNA and RBPJ, the major downstream effector of Notch signaling. From 1492 compounds, we identified 18 compounds that disrupt RBPJ-DNA interactions in a dose-dependent manner. Cell-based assays further revealed that auranofin downregulates Notch-dependent transcription and decreases RBPJ-chromatin interactions in cells. Most strikingly, T-ALL cells that depend on Notch signaling for proliferation are more sensitive to auranofin treatment, supporting the notion that auranofin downregulates Notch signaling by disrupting RBPJ-DNA interaction. These results validate the feasibility of our assay scheme to screen for additional Notch inhibitors and provide a rationale to further test the use of auranofin in treating Notch-dependent cancer.",,"['Lake, Robert J', 'Haynes, Mark K', 'Dreval, Kostiantyn', 'Bilkis, Rabeya', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Fan, Hua-Ying']","['Lake RJ', 'Haynes MK', 'Dreval K', 'Bilkis R', 'Sklar LA', 'Fan HY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, Program in Cellular and Molecular Oncology, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Program in Cancer Therapeutics, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Discovery, University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, Program in Cellular and Molecular Oncology, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, Program in Cellular and Molecular Oncology, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Program in Cancer Therapeutics, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Discovery, University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, Program in Cellular and Molecular Oncology, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200622,United States,SLAS Discov,SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,101697563,PMC7442708,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch inhibitor', '*RBPJ-DNA interactions', '*T-ALL', '*auranofin', '*flow cytometry-based high-throughput screening']",,2020/06/23 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/2472555220932552 [doi]'],ppublish,SLAS Discov. 2020 Sep;25(8):895-905. doi: 10.1177/2472555220932552.

Currently, molecularly targeted drugs have been shown to have promising applications in the clinical treatment of lung cancer. This study aims to explore the expression patterns and prognostic potential of enolase 2 (ENO2) in lung cancer. Methods: Differential expressions of ENO2 in lung cancer cases were analyzed using the Oncomine database. Meanwhile, the prognostic potentials of ENO2 in lung cancer were assessed by deploying the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Results: Forty-one studies reported a significant difference in ENO2 expression between tumors and the normal healthy control tissues. Among all the studies, there was an upregulation of ENO2 in 29 studies, and downregulation in 12 studies. 9/41 studies revealed upregulated ENO2 in distinct types of tumor tissues, including cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, sarcoma, and lung cancer. Furthermore, upregulated ENO2 was identified in 365 cases of lung cancer (P<0.05). By analyzing the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, the ENO2 level was negatively correlated to the overall survival of lung cancer patients (P<0.05). Subsequently, subgroup analysis revealed that the prognostic potential of ENO2 was much more pronounced in lung adenocarcinoma patients (P<0.05). Conclusions: ENO2 is upregulated in lung cancer tissues and linked to the prognosis. It can be used as a therapeutic target for developing lung cancer drugs.",['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Although the mechanisms, monitoring, and management of cardiotoxicities have received broad attention, vascular toxicities remain often underrecognized. In addition, the development of new chemotherapeutic drugs bears the risk of vasotoxicities that are yet to be identified and may not be realized with short-term follow-up periods. The propensity to develop PAD and/or stroke reflects the complex interplay between patient's baseline risk and preexisting vascular disease, particularly hypertension and diabetes, while evidence for genetic predisposition is increasing. Chemotherapeutic agents with a prominent vascular side effect profile have been identified. Interruption of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (VEGFIs) signaling (i.e., bevacizumab) is associated with vascular toxicity and clinical sequelae such as hypertension, stroke, and thromboembolism beyond acute coronary syndromes. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil are the main drugs involved in the stroke risk. In addition, circulating concentrations of VEGF are reduced by cyclophosphamide administered at continuous low doses, which might underpin some of the observed vascular toxicity, such as stroke, as seen in patients treated with VEGF inhibitors. The risk of stroke is also increased after treatment with anthracyclines that can induce endothelial dysfunction and increase arterial stiffness. Proteasome inhibitors ( bortezomib and carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), approved for use in multiple myeloma, carry a black box warning for an increased risk of stroke. Finally, head-and-neck radiotherapy is associated with a doubled risk of cerebrovascular ischemic event, especially if exposure occurs in childhood. The mechanisms involved in radiation vasculopathy are represented by endothelial dysfunction, medial necrosis, fibrosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis. However, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is the main antineoplastic drugs involved in the development of PAD. In particular, second- and third-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib and ponatinib, while emerging as a potent arm in contrasting CML, are associated with a higher risk of PAD development rather than traditional imatinib. Factors favoring vascular complication are the presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and predisposing genetic factors, high doses of BCR-ABL TKIs, longer time of drug exposure, and sequential use of potent TKIs. Therefore, accurate cardiovascular risk stratification is strongly recommended in patient candidate to anticancer treatment associated with higher risk of vascular complication, in order to reduce the incidence of PAD and stroke through CVRF correction and selection of appropriate tailored patient strategy of treatment. Then, a clinical follow-up, eventually associated with instrumental evaluation through vascular ultrasound, should be performed.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Journal of Cardiovascular Echography.'],"['Zito, Concetta', 'Manganaro, Roberta', 'Carerj, Scipione', 'Antonini-Canterin, Francesco', 'Benedetto, Frank']","['Zito C', 'Manganaro R', 'Carerj S', 'Antonini-Canterin F', 'Benedetto F']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Cardiology Unit, University of Messina, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria ""Policlinico G.

Inhibition of the glycolytic pathway is therefore a critical strategy in cancer therapy. A non-metabolic glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), has been the focus of research on glycolytic inhibitors for use in cancer treatment. The current study examined the anti-cancer effects of 2-DG on idarubicin (IDA)-resistant P388 (P388/IDA) leukemia cells. P388/IDA cells were established following continuous exposure of IDA to P388 cells. Characterization of P388/IDA cells revealed increased lactate production and glucose consumption compared with P388 parent cells. The results of a cell viability assay determined that 2-DG induces higher toxicity in P388/IDA cells compared with P388 cells. Although 2-DG also exhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing activity, the cytotoxic effect of the ER stress inducer, tunicamycin, on P388/IDA cells was lower than that of P388 cells. A combination of 2-DG and IDA enhanced P388/IDA cell death compared with each agent alone. The results indicated that P388 cells activated glycolysis after acquiring IDA resistance and therefore, inhibition of the glycolytic pathway via 2-DG might be a useful strategy for cancer therapy against IDA- resistant leukemia cells.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Matsuo, Taisuke', 'Konya, Yumiko', 'Hirayama, Eri', 'Sadzuka, Yasuyuki']","['Matsuo T', 'Konya Y', 'Hirayama E', 'Sadzuka Y']","['Division of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Iwate Medical University, Iwate 028-3694, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Iwate Medical University, Iwate 028-3694, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Iwate Medical University, Iwate 028-3694, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Iwate Medical University, Iwate 028-3694, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200513,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC7285881,['NOTNLM'],"['2-deoxy-D-glucose', 'apoptosis', 'glycolysis', 'leukemia']",,2020/06/23 06:00,2020/06/23 06:01,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2020.11616 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-11616 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2020 Jul;20(1):962-966. doi: 10.3892/ol.2020.11616.

B-ALL is characterized by the rapid proliferation of poorly differentiated lymphoid progenitor cells inside the bone marrow. In the United States, ~4,000 of these patients are diagnosed each year, accounting for ~30% of childhood cancer types. The tumorigenesis of the disease involves a number of abnormal gene expressions (including TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL-1, RAS and PI3K) leading to dysregulated cell cycle. Risk factors of B-ALL are the history of parvovirus B 19 infection, high birth weight and exposure to environmental toxins. These risk factors can induce abnormal DNA methylation and DNA damages. Treatment procedures are divided into three phases: Induction, consolidation and maintenance. The goal of treatment is complete remission without relapses. Apart from traditional treatments, newly developed approaches include gene targeting therapy, with the aim of wiping out leukemic cells through the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases and via c-Myb inhibition enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy. To evaluate the efficacy of ongoing treatments, several indicators are currently used.

Its mechanism of action involves the induction of apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis. However, it remains unclear whether dasatinib can induce pyroptosis. In the present study, gasdermin E (GSDME)-expressing SH-SY5Y and A549 cells were chosen for investigation. Typical pyroptotic features, such as cleavage of GSDME protein, leakage of lactate dehydrogenase and large bubbled morphology, were observed in both cell lines after exposure to dasatinib. The generation of GSDME fragments was inhibited by specific caspase-3 inhibitor zDEVD in SH-SY5Y cells and pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD in A549 cells. Moreover, distinct characteristics of pyroptosis were observed in A549 cells, which occurred only with a high percentage of Annexin V/propidium iodide double-stained cells and low level of GSDME protein cleavage. The sensitivity of A549 cells to dasatinib is significantly reduced by increasing cell numbers. The elevation of GSDMD and GSDME protein levels was induced by low concentrations of dasatinib, which was not influenced by the reduction of p53 protein with RNA interference. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that dasatinib can induce pyroptosis in tumor cells and increase the protein levels of GSDMD and GSDME in a p53-independent manner.",['Copyright: (c) Zhang et al.'],"['Zhang, Juan', 'Chen, Yang', 'He, Qiyang']","['Zhang J', 'Chen Y', 'He Q']","['Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100050, P.R.

To date, four members of the PBX family have been identified to be involved in human cancer but little is known about their expression patterns and precise functions in breast cancer (BC) progression. The aim of the present study was to determine whether they have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers in patients with BC. The expression patterns of PBXs were evaluated using Oncomine, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Gene expression-based Outcome for Breast cancer Online algorithm analyses. The prognostic value of PBX1 was determined by Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis. It was observed that, among all PBX family members, only PBX1 was significantly upregulated in BC vs. normal tissues. Meta-analysis in the Oncomine database revealed that PBX1 was significantly upregulated in invasive breast carcinoma stroma, ductal breast carcinoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, invasive mixed breast carcinoma and male breast carcinoma compared with normal tissues. In addition, PBX1 was significantly correlated with forkhead box protein A1. Subtype analysis indicated that PBX1 overexpression was associated with luminal-like and hormone receptor-sensitive subtypes. In the survival analysis, a high expression level of PBX1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, luminal A and luminal B subtypes of BC. The results of the present study indicate that PBX1 may serve as a specific biomarker and essential prognostic factor for ER-positive, luminal A and luminal B subtypes of BC.",['Copyright: (c) Ao et al.'],"['Ao, Xiang', 'Ding, Wei', 'Ge, Hu', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Ding, Dan', 'Liu, Ying']","['Ao X', 'Ding W', 'Ge H', 'Zhang Y', 'Ding D', 'Liu Y']","['Center for Precision Medicine, Institute for Translational Medicine, College of Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266021, P.R.

This study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of combining Gilteritinib with ATO at low concentration in the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive leukemias. Methods: We used both in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate the effects of combination of Gilteritinib with ATO at low concentration on FLT3-ITD positive leukemias, together with the underlying molecular mechanisms of these processes. Results: Combination of Gilteritinib with ATO showed synergistic effects on inhibiting proliferation, increasing apoptosis and attenuating invasive ability in FLT3-ITD-mutated cells and reducing tumor growth in nude mice. Results of western blot indicated that Gilteritinib increased a 160KD form of FLT3 protein on the surface of cell membrane. Detection of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker protein revealed that IRE1a and its downstream signal phosphorylated JNK were suppressed in Gilteritinib-treated FLT3-ITD positive cells. The downregulation of IRE1a induced by Gilteritinib was reversed with addition of ATO. Knockdown of IRE1a diminished the combinatorial effects of Gilteritinib plus ATO treatment and combination of tunicamycin (an endoplasmic reticulum pathway activator) with Gilteritinib achieved the similar effect as treatment with Gilteritinib plus ATO. Conclusions: Thus, ATO at low concentration potentiates Gilteritinib-induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD positive leukemic cells via IRE1a-JNK signal pathway, targeting IRE1a to cooperate with Gilteritinib may serve as a new theoretical basis on FLT3-ITD mutant AML treatment.",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],"['Hu, Xiaoli', 'Cai, Jiayi', 'Zhu, Jianyi', 'Lang, Wenjing', 'Zhong, Jihua', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Chen, Fangyuan']","['Hu X', 'Cai J', 'Zhu J', 'Lang W', 'Zhong J', 'Zhong H', 'Chen F']","['Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293', 'Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 160 Pujian Road, Shanghai, 200127 China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC7298957,['NOTNLM'],"['ATO', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Gilteritinib', 'IRE1a-JNK']",['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],2020/06/23 06:00,2020/06/23 06:01,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01341-5 [doi]', '1341 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Jun 17;20:250. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01341-5. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the influence of these factors on patient survival can guide treatment decisions and may inform prognostic discussions. We conducted a systematic literature review to determine survival of patients with intracranial hemorrhages and concomitant hematologic malignancy. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted and followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Ovid, SCOPUS, and Embase databases were queried with the following terms: (""intracranial hemorrhages"" OR ""brain hemorrhage"" OR ""cerebral hemorrhage"" OR ""subdural hematoma"" OR ""epidural hematoma"" OR ""intraparenchymal hemorrhage"") AND (""Hematologic Neoplasms"" OR ""Myeloproliferative Disorders"" OR ""Myelofibrosis"" OR ""Essential thrombocythemia"" OR ""Leukemia""). Abstracts and articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria that were determined a priori. RESULTS: Literature review yielded 975 abstracts from which a total of 68 full-text articles were reviewed. Twelve articles capturing 634 unique patients were included in the final qualitative analysis. Median overall survival for all patients ranged from 20 days to 1.5 months while median overall survival for the subset of patients having ICH within 10 days of diagnosis of hematologic malignancy was 5 days. Intraparenchymal hemorrhages, multiple foci of hemorrhage, transfusion-resistant low platelet counts, leukocytosis, low Glasgow Coma Scale scores at presentation, and ICH early in treatment course were associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Survival for patients with hematologic malignancies and concomitant ICHs remains poor. Early detection, recognition of poor prognostic factors, and correction of hematologic abnormalities essential to prevention and treatment of ICHs in this patient population.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 8305 ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database during 1975 to 2015 were included in this study, of which 7454 (80.11%) were in the de novo ALL group, and 851 (19.89%) were in the secondary ALL (sALL) group. Propensity matching was used before comparison of OS between the two groups. RESULTS: Female ALL patients had a lower risk of death than male (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.98; P < .01). The mortality of black patients was higher than in white patients (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.42; P < .001). Patients aged 45-75 years (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.72-1.94; P < .001) and >/= 75 years (HR, 3.85; 95% CI, 3.52-4.23; P < .001) had a higher risk of death.

The viral Tax oncoprotein plays a central role in HTLV-1 pathogenicity, mainly due to its capacity of inducing the transcriptional activity of various transcriptional factors like NFB. Eucalyptus camaldulensis (Ec) is considered as a traditional medicinal plant with valuable therapeutic effects. Here we evaluated the activity of its ethanolic leave extract on different Tax activities by testing its influence on Tax-induced activity of NFB and HTLV-1 LTR in Jurkat cells. Our results showed that Ec inhibited Tax induced activation of NFB -, SRF- dependent promoters and HTLV-1 LTR. Ec extract has no effect on the binding of Tax to NFB while it strongly prevented the degradation of IBalpha induced by Tax probably as a result of preventing the link between Tax and IKKgamma. In addition, increasing the cellular level of P-TEFb-cyclinT1 significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of Ec on Tax activities, probably by preventing the interaction between Tax and P-TEFb-cyclin T1. The 40%-MeOH fraction of this extract, which is rich with polyphenols, offered the highest inhibitory effect against Tax activities. Further studies are required for the isolation and identification of active component/s in this extract which may be developed in the future as preventive/curing drugs for HTLV-1 related diseases.",,"['Abu-Jafar, Aya', 'Suleiman, Manal', 'Nesim, Noa', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud']","['Abu-Jafar A', 'Suleiman M', 'Nesim N', 'Huleihel M']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev , Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200621,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC7469432,['NOTNLM'],"['* Eucalyptus camaldulensis', '*HTLV-1 Tax', '*NFB', '*ethanolic extract']",,2020/06/23 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2020/06/23 06:00'],"['2020/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2020.1779455 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2020 Jul;19(14):1768-1776. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2020.1779455.

We assessed the benefits of mogamulizumab for relapsed/refractory ATL in clinical practice. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with acute- and lymphoma-type ATL. Among 57 patients diagnosed with ATL between January 2008 and August 2018, 42 who received salvage therapy were eligible, including 24 who received mogamulizumab. RESULTS: The overall response rate to mogamulizumab was 54.2%. Median survival time (MST) and 1-year overall survival (OS) rate from mogamulizumab initiation were 7.7 months and 42.0%, respectively. Patients with acute-type ATL showed longer MST (15.1 months) and higher 1-year OS (63.6%). MST without skin rash was 5.0 months, and 1-year OS was 34.3%; however, MST with skin rash was not reached and 1-year OS was 66.7%. Among patients who received the salvage therapy, longer MST and higher 1-year OS were observed with mogamulizumab than without mogamulizumab (P = .078; 9.2 vs. 3.9 months; 47.9% vs. 17.6%, respectively).

Given the contradictory findings that fentanyl has both inhibitory and stimulatory activities in cancer cells, we investigated the biological effects of fentanyl alone and its combination with standard of care in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells at all stages of development. We showed that fentanyl at clinically relevant concentration inhibited growth and colony formation of AML differentiated cells and committed progenitors without affecting their survival. Compared to AML cells without FLT3 mutation, cells harboring FLT3-ITD mutation are likely to be more sensitive to fentanyl. However, fentanyl did not affect the most primitive AML stem cells. Fentanyl significantly augmented the efficacy of cytarabine but not midostaurin in AML differentiated cells and committed progenitors. We further demonstrated that fentanyl inhibited AML cells via suppressing Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT5 pathway, and this was not dependent on opioid receptor system. Our findings demonstrate the anti-leukemia activity of fentanyl and synergistic effects between fentanyl and cytarabine in AML, via opioid receptor-independent suppression of Ras and STAT5 pathways.

In this retrospective study, we report the extended results of a sequential regimen of clofarabine, cytosine arabinoside, and RIC in 131 adults with active R/R myeloid disease at transplant. Conditioning consisted of clofarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day) and cytosine arabinoside (1 g/m(2)/day) for 5 days, followed, after a rest of 3 days, by an RIC combining cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) for 1 day, iv busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day) for 2 days, and anti-thymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 days. Between 2007 and 2016, 131 patients (males n = 75, median age: 52.6 years) were identified from the SFGM-TC registry. There were 111 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 20 cases with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndrome.

A total of 950 episodes in 552 patients with BSIs were analyzed. Of whom, 55.9% were male, the median age was 43 years, and 35.6% had acute myeloid leukemia. In total, 1016 microorganisms were isolated from blood cultures. Gram-negatives accounted for 42.4% (n = 403) of the episodes. Among Gram-negatives, Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 346 (86%) (E. coli, n = 197; 34% extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producers, and Klebsiella spp., n = 120; 48.3% ESBL producers). Also, 24 (20.0%) of Klebsiella spp. had carbapenemase activity. There were 6 (5.0%) colistin-resistant Klebsiella spp. Thirteen (26.5%) of Pseudomonas spp. and 17 (60.7%) of Acinetobacter spp. had carbapenemase activity. There were 2 (5.6%) colistin-resistant Acinetobacter spp. The 30-day mortality rates were 12.0%, 21.5%, 34.6%, and 29.0% in BSIs due to Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacterial, fungal, and polymicrobial etiology respectively (p = 0.001). BSIs with ESBL-producing (p = 0.001) isolates, carbapenem (p < 0.001), and colistin-resistant isolates (p < 0.001) were associated with increased mortality risk.

Because fluconazole has been used in our center as anti-yeast prophylaxis, we sought to analyze in detail the incidence of IFIs over a 17-year period, as well as their impact on outcome. A standardized protocol of patient management, including serum galactomannan screening and thoracic CT-guided diagnostic-driven antifungal therapy, was used in all patients. A total of 214 consecutive adults with de novo AML who were treated in 3 CETLAM (Grupo Cooperativo para el Estudio y Tratamiento de las Leucemias Agudas y Mielodisplasias) protocols from 2002 to 2018 were included. The 90-day incidence of any IFI (including possible cases) was 11% (95% CI 4-15%), most cases occurred during induction chemotherapy (8%, 95% CI 4-12%), and most cases were probable/proven IPA (8%, 95% CI 3-13%).

In order to explore the possibility of HLA-mismatched HSCT from family donors beyond haploidentical relatives, we conducted a prospective phase I/II study of 2-HLA-haplotype-mismatched HSCT (2-haplo-mismatch HSCT). We enrolled 30 patients with posttransplant relapse (acute myeloid leukemia: 18, acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 11, non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 1). 2-haplo-mismatch HSCT was performed as the second to sixth transplantations. The donors were siblings (n = 12), cousins (n = 16), and second cousins (n = 2). The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine, cytarabine, melphalan, low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin, and 3 Gy of total body irradiation.

Obatoclax mesylate (OM), a B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family antagonist, is a potential antitumor drug. However, its poor aqueous solubility restricts its clinical application. Although these inherent defects, nanotechnology can be used to improve the solubility and tumor target of OM, promoting its antitumor efficiency. In the present study, the poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) was used and combined with red blood-cell membrane (RBCm) to explore if OM-loaded RBCm nanoparticles could improve the antitumor efficacy of OM for the treatment of lung cancer with relatively lower side effects compared with the free OM. The good physicochemical stability of the prepared RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles was confirmed, and the optimal size of 153 nm was screened out, along with sustained drug release behavior. We found that RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles effectively reduced the proliferation of lung cancer cells. Additionally, RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles considerably induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells by reducing Bcl-2 expression levels, accompanied with the improved Cyto-c releases in cytoplasm and Caspase-3 activation. Mitochondrial membrane potential was also obviously impaired in lung cancer cells incubated with RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles. Compared with free OM, RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles could greatly prolong the drug circulation time in vivo and upgraded the drug concentration accumulated in tumor tissue. Furthermore, RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles exerted stronger antitumor efficacy in vivo against lung cancer progression with superior safety. Therefore, RBCm-OM/PLGA nanoparticles provided new potential for lung cancer therapy with the improved safety and therapeutic effect.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

We previously showed that primary cells of children with TCF3-PBX1 positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) express BTK and are sensitive to ibrutinib in vitro. However, preclinical studies in mice are lacking that justify clinical implementation. METHODS: Immunocompromised NSG mice were engrafted with a luciferase-positive TCF3-PBX1 leukemic cell line or primary leukemic cells and treated with ibrutinib or placebo. Additionally, primary cells were exposed in vitro to 4 main induction drugs as monotherapy and in combination with ibrutinib. RESULTS: Treatment with ibrutinib of mice engrafted with a TCF3-PBX1 cell line, TCF3-PBX1 positive or TCF3-PBX1 negative primary leukemic cells did not result in prolonged life span compared to placebo treated mice. In vitro sensitivity to ibrutinib was unaltered in leukemic cells obtained from engrafted mice compared to the original material. However, ibrutinib treatment did not affect leukemic cell viability and tumor outgrowth, nor could lymphocytosis be detected. Ibrutinib was biologically active, since hCD19(+) cells harvested from ibrutinib treated mice had no detectable levels of phospho-BTK at tyrosine 223 (pBTK Y223), whereas pBTK Y223 was still detectable in placebo treated cases. In combination tests, we noticed an antagonistic effect of ibrutinib on vincristine sensitivity, which was not observed for prednisolone, L-asparaginase and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ibrutinib is not the precision medicine of choice for TCF3-PBX1 positive BCP-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

In this study, we firstly demonstrated that chidamide alone inhibited CML cells proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Further, chidamide combined with imatinib (IM) induced synergistic lethality in CML cell line KBM5, as well as IM-resistant CML cells KBM5(T315I), associated with a marked reduction of Bcr-Abl kinase activity and acetyl-histone H3 expression. The combination treatment markedly inhibited constitutive activity of beta-catenin signaling in IM-resistant cells and abolished the protective effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to CML cells. In addition, the co-treatment significantly reduced Bcr-Abl and beta-catenin transcript levels and induced apoptosis of primary CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells derived from blast crisis (BC)-CML patients, but exhibited minimal toxicity to normal CD34(+) progenitors. Collectively, our data show that combination of chidamide and imatinib synergistically targets tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) -resistant BC-CML cells via inhibition of Bcr-Abl and beta-catenin signaling, suggesting that this combination has the potential for treating TKI-resistant CML and improving clinical outcomes of BC-CML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Silencing of ANKHD1 expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and accumulation of cells at the S phase. In this study we found ANKHD1 expression to be higher at the S phase, suggesting it to be an S phase protein. We observed that ANKHD1 interacts with histone promoter regions and its inhibition downregulates expression of all core histones, implying a role in histone synthesis. Since histone synthesis occurs in parallel with DNA replication at S phase, we evaluated PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) expression, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. PCNA expression was found to be significantly decreased in ANKHD1 silenced cells. We further observed accumulation gammaH2AX, a marker for DNA double stranded breaks and an early sign of DNA damage induced by replication stress, upon ANKHD1 silencing. The expressions of several genes implicated in DNA repair were also modulated in ANKHD1 silenced cells, confirming the role of ANKHD1 in DNA repair. Based on this study we speculate that ANKHD1 is an S phase protein required for histone synthesis and DNA repair.

OBJECTIVE: To measure cancer incidence among the population exposed to atmospheric emissions from the waste incineration plant near the town of Nice (South-Eastern France), compared to the unexposed population of the Alpes-Maritimes department (A-M). METHODS: All primary invasive cancers and haematological malignancies diagnosed among AM residents between 2005 and 2014 were recorded. The exposed surface was modeled on an average dioxin deposition model >/=4.25 ng/m(2)/year. Each case was geolocated and assigned to one of 36 predefined geographic units of exposed area, or one of 462 units in the unexposed area. The adjusted incidence rate, the standardized incidence ratio and the Comparative Morbidity Figure were calculated for two periods: 2005-2009/2010-2014. RESULTS: We recorded 80,865 new cancers in the A-M population. Between 2005 and 2009, we observed a higher incidence among exposed women of acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloma and, among exposed men, of soft tissue sarcomas, myeloma and lung cancer. Between 2010 and 2014, there was no excess incidence among women, while among men incidence of myeloma and lung cancer remained higher. CONCLUSION: Only among men, the incidence of myeloma and lung cancer remained higher in the exposed area during the second period. The EU directive resulting in the limitation of atmospheric emissions from incinerators could explain the decrease in incidence of cancers with protracted latency. Consideration of other risk factors and further data collection will be necessary to validate this hypothesis.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: As proof of principle, we defined TTI and TTSI, using the Fine-Gray model to include competing risks in estimates, in a case study in real life of a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with cancer receiving a targeted therapy. HRQOL was evaluated before and during therapy with six assessments over a 24-month period, using the well-validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30. RESULTS: For each assessed HRQOL domain, we assessed TTI and TTSI and estimated the cumulative incidence of patients' clinically meaningful improvements, also accounting for the occurrence of competing events. CONCLUSION: TTI and TTSI are potentially important outcomes in the era of modern anticancer therapies. The analysis of TTI and TTSI by competing risks approach will further add to the statistical methods that can be used to inform on the impact of cancer therapies on patients' HRQOL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effects of MAC on autophagy in other cancer cells remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that MAC activated autophagy in human glioblastoma. MAC increased expression of autophagy-related proteins, such as LC3-II and Beclin-1. Moreover, MAC stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and suppressed phosphorylation of the mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. The well-known AMPK activator metformin increased LC3-II levels, which were augmented by MAC cotreatment. AMPK knockdown decreased LC3-II levels and inhibited MAC activation of autophagy. Furthermore, MAC suppression of c-Myc expression activated autophagy. Treatment with the c-MYC inhibitor, 10058-FA, induced autophagy, as did c-Myc small interfering RNA knockdown. These effects were augmented by MAC cotreatment. Taken together, these findings indicated that MAC induces autophagy in human glioblastoma by activating AMPK signaling and inhibiting c-Myc protein expression in human glioblastoma.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Hwang, Soon-Kyung', 'Han, Si-Yoon', 'Jeong, Yun-Jeong', 'Magae, Junji', 'Bae, Young-Seuk', 'Chang, Young-Chae']","['Hwang SK', 'Han SY', 'Jeong YJ', 'Magae J', 'Bae YS', 'Chang YC']","['Department of Medicine, Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Magae Bioscience Institute, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200620,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,,['NOTNLM'],"['4-O-methylascochlorin', 'AMPK', 'autophagy', 'c-Myc', 'glioblastoma']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/06/09 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22552 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2020 Oct;34(10):e22552. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22552.

Sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) is the major dose-limiting toxicity for MTAs and can limit clinical efficacy. The current pharmacogenomic study aimed to identify genetic variations that explain patient susceptibility and drive mechanisms underlying development of MTA-induced PN. A meta-analysis of genomewide association studies (GWAS) from two clinical cohorts treated with MTAs (Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40502 and CALGB 40101) was conducted using a Cox regression model with cumulative dose to first instance of grade 2 or higher PN. Summary statistics from a GWAS of European subjects (n = 469) in CALGB 40502 that estimated cause-specific risk of PN were meta-analyzed with those from a previously published GWAS of European ancestry (n = 855) from CALGB 40101 that estimated the risk of PN. Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms in an enhancer region downstream of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1 encoding S1PR1 ; e.g., rs74497159, betaCALGB 40101 per allele log hazard ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.591 (0.254-0.928), betaCALGB 40502 per allele log hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.693 (0.334-1.053); PMETA = 3.62 x 10(-7) ) were the most highly ranked associations based on P values with risk of developing grade 2 and higher PN. In silico functional analysis identified multiple regulatory elements and potential enhancer activity for S1PR1 within this genomic region. Inhibition of S1PR1 function in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human sensory neurons shows partial protection against paclitaxel-induced neurite damage. These pharmacogenetic findings further support ongoing clinical evaluations to target S1PR1 as a therapeutic strategy for prevention and/or treatment of MTA-induced neuropathy.","['(c) 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (c) 2020 American', 'Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.']","['Chua, Katherina C', 'Xiong, Chenling', 'Ho, Carol', 'Mushiroda, Taisei', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Mulkey, Flora', 'Lai, Dongbing', 'Schneider, Bryan P', 'Rashkin, Sara R', 'Witte, John S', 'Friedman, Paula N', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'McLeod, Howard L', 'Rugo, Hope S', 'Shulman, Lawrence N', 'Kubo, Michiaki', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Kroetz, Deanna L']","['Chua KC', 'Xiong C', 'Ho C', 'Mushiroda T', 'Jiang C', 'Mulkey F', 'Lai D', 'Schneider BP', 'Rashkin SR', 'Witte JS', 'Friedman PN', 'Ratain MJ', 'McLeod HL', 'Rugo HS', 'Shulman LN', 'Kubo M', 'Owzar K', 'Kroetz DL']","['Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics Graduate Program, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genotyping Development, Riken Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genotyping Development, Riken Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200802,United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,PMC7718413,,,,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cpt.1958 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2020 Sep;108(3):625-634. doi: 10.1002/cpt.1958.

The IGHV SHM status has traditionally been determined by conventional Sanger sequencing. However, NGS has heralded a new era in medical diagnostics and immunogenetic analysis is following this trend. There is indeed a growing demand for shifting practice and using NGS for IGHV gene SHM assessment, although it is debatable whether it is always justifiable, at least taking into account financial considerations for laboratories with limited resources. Nevertheless, as this analysis impacts on treatment decisions, standardization of both technical aspects, and data interpretation becomes essential. Also, the need for establishing new recommendations and providing dedicated education and training on NGS-based immunogenetics is greater than ever before. Here we address potential and challenges of NGS-based immunogenetics in CLL.

Previously, we showed that ATRA in combination with Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibition by tranylcypromine (TCP) can induce myeloid differentiation in AML blasts. This phase I/II clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of TCP/ATRA treatment as salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML. The combination was evaluated in 18 patients, ineligible for intensive treatment. The overall response rate was 20%, including two complete remissions without hematological recovery and one partial response. We also observed myeloid differentiation upon TCP/ATRA treatment in patients who did not reach clinical remission. Median overall survival (OS) was 3.3 months, and one-year OS 22%. One patient developed an ATRA-induced differentiation syndrome. The most frequently reported adverse events were vertigo and hypotension. TCP plasma levels correlated with intracellular TCP concentration. Increased H3K4me1 and H3k4me2 levels were observed in AML blasts and white blood cells from some TCP/ATRA treated patients. Combined TCP/ATRA treatment can induce differentiation of AML blasts and lead to clinical response in heavily pretreated patients with r/r AML with acceptable toxicity.

To elucidate the effect of PTPN11 mutations (PTPN11(mut)) on clinical outcomes, we screened adult patients with AML treated at our institution using targeted next-generation sequencing. Among 1406 consecutive patients, 112 (8%) had PTPN11(mut). These mutations were more commonly associated with the acute myelomonocytic/monocytic leukemia subtype than was wild-type PTPN11, while none were detected in patients with core-binding factor AML. They co-occurred more commonly with NPM1 mutations and FLT3 internal tandem duplications and less commonly with mutations in IDH2 and a complex karyotype. Compared with the wild-type allele, PTPN11(mut) was associated with lower complete response rates (54% vs 40%; P = 0.04), and shorter overall survival (median 13.6 vs 8.4 months; P = 0.008). In a multivariate analysis, PTPN11(mut) independently increased the risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.25-2.29; P = 0.0007).

Recent advances have extended donor availability for patients without matched donors. Transplantation is now increasingly offered to older patients, including those above 70 years and less fit individuals. Better prognostic models are being developed. Proceeding faster to transplantation with haploidentical donors if an urgent transplant is needed, such as in patients with detectable minimal residual disease, may allow more patients to get to transplant, and it is hoped more will be cured from their disease. With continuous improvements in treatment-related toxicity and mortality, relapse has become the most important cause of treatment failure, and novel approaches are needed to make the next big leap in the treatment of this disease with transplantation. In this review we aim to summarize recent advances and provide future research directions in the transplantation for patients with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The ATG dosage is determined by the recipient's body weight, but some insist that this approach does not reflect the actual target of ATG. In this respect, weight-based dosing may lead to ATG overdose, particularly in recipients with a relatively low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). We retrospectively analyzed 84 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent matched related donor (MRD) allo-HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) at a single institution. Patients were dichotomized according to the ALC measured on the first day of conditioning (day -7) to investigate the associations of the ALC with GVHD and survival outcomes. The median duration of follow-up was 29 months. The preconditioning ALC was closely correlated with the ALC at the first ATG administration (day -3). The cumulative incidences of both acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were significantly lower in the preconditioning ALC <500/muL group compared with the ALC >/=500/muL group. There was no significant difference in disease relapse incidence between the 2 groups; however, mortality was significantly higher in the ALC <500/muL group. Multivariate analysis including disease status, modified European Blood and Marrow Transplantation score, and preconditioning ALC (>/=500/muL versus <500/muL) identified disease status and ALC as being independently associated with overall survival (OS). In particular, infection was the most common cause of death in the ALC <500/muL group. Our data suggest that uniform weight-based ATG dosing in MRD allo-HSCT with RIC is associated with an increase in nonrelapse mortality and a relatively inferior OS in patients with a significantly low preconditioning ALC. Therefore, alternative strategies for the integration of ATG should be considered in allo-HSCT, at least for patients with a substantially low preconditioning ALC.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although cases of ALV-J infection have been reported as early as 2001 in Pakistan, there was no further research on the isolation and molecular characteristics of ALVs. In the present study, we first isolated two ALVs from suspicious clinical samples that were collected from a desi chicken farm in Pakistan. The results of multiplex PCR and indirect immunofluorescent antibody assays confirmed that the two isolates (PK19FA01 and PK19SA01) belonged to ALV-J. The complete genomes of the two isolates were amplified, sequenced, and systematically analyzed. We found that gp85 of PK19FA01 was more similar to that of the prototype strain HPRS103, whereas gp85 of PK19SA01 was more similar to that of American strains. The two isolates contained an intact E element of 147 residues and had a unique 135 bp deletion in the redundant transmembrane of the 3' untranslated region. The U3 region of the two isolates was highly homologous to that of American ALV-J strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation, complete genome sequencing, and systematic molecular epidemiological investigation of ALV-J in Pakistan.

Iran is one of the endemic regions of the HTLV-1 in the Middle East. To infer the origin of the virus in Iran and to follow the movements of human population and routes of virus spread to this country, phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses were performed. To this purpose, the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of HTLV-1 was used. New LTR sequences were obtained from 100 blood samples which infected with HTLV-1. Moreover, all Iranian LTR sequences which have been reported so far, were obtained from GenBank database. Sequences were aligned and maximum-likelihood and Bayesian tree topologies were explored. After identification of Iranian specific cluster, molecular-clock and coalescent models were used to estimate time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA). Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSP), representing population dynamics HTLV-1 strains back to the MRCA, were estimated using BEAST software. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the Iranian, Kuwaiti, German, Israelite and southern Indian isolates are located within the widespread ""transcontinental"" subgroup A clade of HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan subtype a. Molecular clock analysis of the Iranian cluster dated back their respective tMRCA to be 1290 AC with a 95% HPD confidence intervals (918, 1517). BSPs indicated a rapid exponential growth rate in the effective number of infections prior the 15th century. Our results support the hypothesis of a multiple introductions of HTLV-1 into Iran with the majority of introductions occurring in prior the 15th century, at the same time the Mongol invasion of Iran. Our results further suggest that HTLV-1 introduction into Iran was facilitated by the commercial/migratory linkage as known as the ancient Silk Road which linked China to Antioch (now in Turkey).",['Copyright (c) 2020.

RA-FLS display passive pro-inflammatory responses and self-directed aggressive responses, such as pro-inflammatory mediator production, reduced apoptosis and formation of a thickened synovial lining. Evidence suggests a role for Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and transcriptional activator (STAT) signaling in the passive response but the aggressive behavior of RA-FLS is poorly understood. The pharmacologic effects of the novel JAK inhibitor, peficitinib, on cytokine-induced intracellular signaling and self-directed aggressive behavior of RA-FLS (e.g., increased expression of apoptosis-resistant genes and sodium nitroprusside-induced apoptosis) were investigated and compared with approved JAK inhibitors. RA-FLS assembly to form a lining-like structure and pro-inflammatory mediator production was investigated in three-dimensional (3D)-micromass culture. Peficitinib inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in RA-FLS following induction by interferon (IFN)-alpha2b, IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor in a concentration-related manner, and was comparable to approved JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib. Peficitinib and tofacitinib suppressed autocrine phosphorylation of STAT3 and expression of apoptosis-resistant genes, and promoted cell death. In 3D-micromass culture, peficitinib reduced multi-layered RA-FLS cells to a thin monolayer, an effect less pronounced with tofacitinib. Both compounds attenuated production of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, matrix metalloproteinases, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor superfamily-11. This study confirmed the pathogenic role of uncontrolled JAK-STAT signaling in the aggressive and passive responses of RA-FLS that are critical for RA progression. The novel JAK inhibitor peficitinib suppressed the pro-inflammatory behavior of RA-FLS, accelerated cell death and abrogated thickening of the synovium.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

CD123 has been recently found to be a marker of leukemic stem cells, and its utility to measure residual disease and potential role in disease relapse is under evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we have evaluated the expression of CD123 in 757 samples of acute leukemia including 479 treatment-naive and 278 follow-up samples and compared with post-induction morphologic complete remission and measurable residual disease (MRD) status. Multiparametric flow cytometry was used for assessment of CD123 expression and immunophenotypic characterization of leukemic blasts at diagnostic and MRD assessment time points. RESULTS: Using variable cutoffs of 5%, 10%, and 20% to define a case as CD123-positive, expression of CD123 was observed in 75.6%, 66.2%, and 50% of AML and 88.6%, 81.8%, and 75% of B-ALL, respectively. Of 11 patients, 7 (63.63%) had mixed phenotype acute leukemia, but none of the 12 patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed positivity for CD123. CD123 expression at diagnosis was associated with post-induction MRD-positive status in both B-ALL (P < .001) and AML (P = .001). We also evaluated the utility of CD123 as a leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype and found it to be useful in both patients with AML (baseline, 50.6%; follow-up, 53%) and B-ALL (baseline, 75%; follow-up, 73.07%). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, CD123 may be considered as a cardinal marker for residual disease assessment and response evaluation in AML and B-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who had received a first SCT between 2000 and 2016 in our institution. The outcome of 22 patients who required ICU admission during chemotherapy prior to SCT (ICU group) was compared with 44 matched patients (1:2) who did not need it (NO-ICU group). RESULTS: There were no differences in transplant complications, in time to neutrophil and platelet recovery or in the length of hospital stay during SCT between the ICU and NO-ICU groups. However, microbiologically documented infections were more common in the ICU group (16/20) than in the NO-ICU group (18/39) (p=.027). The 5-yr overall survival probability (CI 95%) was 49% (28-70%) in the ICU vs. 45% (29-61%) in the NO-ICU group (p=.353), while the 5-yr incidence of non-relapse mortality was 32% (14-52%) and 24% (12-38%) (p=.333), respectively. Six patients (27%) in the ICU group and 8 (18%) in the NO-ICU group required admission to the ICU during or after the SCT procedure (p=.293). Twelve (54%) patients in the ICU and 22 (50%) in the NO-ICU group died, the causes of death were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Our results show that admission to the ICU prior to SCT does not have a negative impact on patient outcomes following SCT and should not be considered as an exclusion criterion for SCT.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

As a result, a transient microchimerism is induced without engraftment. Its efficacy relies both on host immune system stimulation (recipient versus tumor) and on a graft versus tumor effect. Data are scarce and concern mostly Asian patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). In comparison to conventional treatment without MT, higher complete remission rates and longer disease free survival and overall survival have been reported. Safety seems acceptable. The most frequent adverse event is non-severe cytokine release syndrome. Risk of GVHD remains very low. Here, we summarize the published data and detail the practical aspects of the procedure. Current data are not strong enough to provide recommendations on indications. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to propose MT to patients with AML or HR-MDS, regardless of age, presenting an indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation but ineligible for it.

The objective of this study is to develop a target-oriented drug carrier to minimize these adverse effects by the controlled release of the drug. METHODS: KIT-5 nanoparticles were functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and conjugated to rituximab as the targeting agent for the CD20 positive receptors of the B-cells. Then they were loaded with imatinib and their physical properties were characterized. The cell cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was studied by MTT assay in Ramos (CD20 positive) and Jurkat cell lines (CD20 negative) and their cellular uptake was shown by fluorescence microscope. Wistar rats received an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of the free drug or targeted nanoparticles for 21 days. Then the level of aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured in serum of animals. The cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of the drug were also studied by hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tissues. RESULTS: The targeted nanoparticles of imatinib showed to be more cytotoxic to Ramos cells rather than Jurkat cells. The results of the biochemical analysis displayed a significant reduction in AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH levels in animals treated with targeted nanoparticles, compared to the free drug group. By comparison with the free imatinib, histopathological results represented less cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in the animals, which received the drug through the current designed delivery system. CONCLUSION: The obtained results confirmed that the rituximab targeted KIT-5 nanoparticles are promising in the controlled release of imatinib and could decrease its cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity side effects.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Varshosaz, Jaleh', 'Fardshouraki, Saeedeh', 'Mirian, Mina', 'Safaeian, Leila', 'Jandaghian, Setareh', 'Taymouri, Somayeh']","['Varshosaz J', 'Fardshouraki S', 'Mirian M', 'Safaeian L', 'Jandaghian S', 'Taymouri S']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Center, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Center, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Office of Research and Development, Vice Chancellery for Food and Drug, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Center, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Center, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Imatinib', '*KIT-5', '*cardiotoxicity', '*hepatotoxicity', '*lymphoblastic leukemia', '*rituximab']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-107477 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200619174323 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(16):1966-1980. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200619174323.,,16,,20210602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Capsules)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Capsules', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Porosity', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rituximab/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface Properties']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) is an oncogenic non-coding RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides. The UCA1 regulate critical biological processes that are involved in cancer progression, including cancer cell growth, invasion, migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis. So It should not surprise that UCA1 overexpresses in variety of cancers type, including pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, adrenal cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, oral cancer, gallbladder cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, osteosarcoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, leukemia, glioma, thyroid cancer, medulloblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple myeloma.

In this study, we generated the first BIA-ALCL patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model (IL89) and a matching continuous cell line (IL89_CL#3488) to discover potential vulnerabilities and druggable targets. We characterized IL89 and IL89_CL#3488, both phenotypically and genotypically, and demonstrated that they closely resemble the matching human primary lymphoma. The tumor content underwent significant enrichment along passages, as confirmed by the increased variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations. Known aberrations (JAK1 and KMT2C) were identified, together with novel hits, including PDGFB, PDGFRA, and SETBP1. A deep sequencing approach allowed the detection of mutations below the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) sensitivity threshold, including JAK1G1097D, in the primary sample. RNA sequencing confirmed the expression of a signature of differentially expressed genes in BIA-ALCL. Next, we tested IL89's sensitivity to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and observed a potent anti-tumor effect, both in vitro and in vivo. We also implemented a high-throughput drug screening approach to identify compounds associated with increased responses in the presence of ruxolitinib. In conclusion, these new IL89 BIA-ALCL models closely recapitulate the primary correspondent lymphoma and represent an informative platform for dissecting the molecular features of BIA-ALCL and performing pre-clinical drug discovery studies, fostering the development of new precision medicine approaches.",,"['Fiore, Danilo', 'Cappelli, Luca Vincenzo', 'Zumbo, Paul', 'Phillips, Jude M', 'Liu, Zhaoqi', 'Cheng, Shuhua', 'Yoffe, Liron', 'Ghione, Paola', 'Di Maggio, Federica', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Khodos, Inna', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Casano, Joseph', 'Kayembe, Clarisse', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Betel, Doron', ""Foa', Robin"", 'Cerchietti, Leandro', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Horwitz, Steven', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Inghirami, Giorgio']","['Fiore D', 'Cappelli LV', 'Zumbo P', 'Phillips JM', 'Liu Z', 'Cheng S', 'Yoffe L', 'Ghione P', 'Di Maggio F', 'Dogan A', 'Khodos I', 'de Stanchina E', 'Casano J', 'Kayembe C', 'Tam W', 'Betel D', ""Foa' R"", 'Cerchietti L', 'Rabadan R', 'Horwitz S', 'Weinstock DM', 'Inghirami G']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Applied Bioinformatics Core, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC7352499,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK/STAT pathway', 'drug discovery', 'patient-derived tumor xenograft', 'pre-clinical model', 'precision medicine']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2020/06/21 06:01,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12061603 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12061603 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jun 17;12(6). pii: cancers12061603. doi: 10.3390/cancers12061603.,"['P01 CA229100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Core Grant No. P30-CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5x1000, Special Program Metastases (21198)/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca', 'sul Cancro', 'U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'SCOR grant #7011-16/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society']",6,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3004-6862', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8090-3880', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7234-2024', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2999-5254', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3040-8205', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6576-5256', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7322-6375', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0608-1350']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that asthma and allergic rhinitis diminish the risk of various cancers, including colon cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. On the other hand, asthma augments the risk of lung cancer and an increased risk of breast cancer in patients with allergy has been observed. Thus, the relation between allergy and cancer is not straightforward and furthermore, its biological mechanism is unknown. The HTRA (high temperature requirement A) proteases promote apoptosis, may function as tumor suppressors and HTRA1 is known to be released by mast cells. Interleukin-12 (Il-12) is an important cytokine that induces antitumor immune responses and is produced mainly by dendritic cells that co-localize with mast cells in superficial organs. Material and methods: In the present study we have assessed with ELISA plasma levels of the HTRA proteins, Il-12, and of the anti-HTRA autoantibodies in children with allergy (40) and in age matched controls (39). Children are a special population, since they usually do not have comorbidities and take not many drugs the processes we want to observe are not influenced by many other factors. Results: We have found a significant increase of HTRA1, 2 and 3, and of the Il-12 levels in the children with atopy (asthma and allergic rhinitis) compared to controls. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the HTRA1-3 and Il-12 levels might be useful in analyzing the pro- and antioncogenic potential in young atopic patients.",,"['Renke, Joanna', 'Wasilewska, Eliza', 'Kedzierska-Mieszkowska, Sabina', 'Zorena, Katarzyna', 'Baranska, Sylwia', 'Wenta, Tomasz', 'Liberek, Anna', 'Siluk, Danuta', 'Zurawa-Janicka, Dorota', 'Szczepankiewicz, Aleksandra', 'Renke, Marcin', 'Lipinska, Barbara']","['Renke J', 'Wasilewska E', 'Kedzierska-Mieszkowska S', 'Zorena K', 'Baranska S', 'Wenta T', 'Liberek A', 'Siluk D', 'Zurawa-Janicka D', 'Szczepankiewicz A', 'Renke M', 'Lipinska B']","['Department of General and Medical Biochemistry, University of Gdansk, Wita Stwosza 59 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Allergology, Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 7, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of General and Medical Biochemistry, University of Gdansk, Wita Stwosza 59 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Environmental Microbiology Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 7, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Bacterial Molecular Genetics University of Gdansk Wita Stwosza 59, 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of General and Medical Biochemistry, University of Gdansk, Wita Stwosza 59 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences with Subfaculty of Nursing, Medical University of Gdansk, Tuwima 15, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacodynamics, Medical University of Gdansk, Hallera 107, 80-416 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of General and Medical Biochemistry, University of Gdansk, Wita Stwosza 59 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology, Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-512 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Occupational, Metabolic and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Gdansk, Powstania Styczniowego 9B, 81-519 Gdynia, Poland.', 'Department of General and Medical Biochemistry, University of Gdansk, Wita Stwosza 59 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,PMC7353852,['NOTNLM'],"['HTRA proteases', 'Il-12', 'allergy', 'mast cells', 'oncogenesis']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['medicina56060298 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina56060298 [doi]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2020 Jun 17;56(6). pii: medicina56060298. doi: 10.3390/medicina56060298.,,6,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5389-9190', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5288-0586', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5756-3013', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2640-3791', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1927-9959', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1623-7486', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5048-2245', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3379-9106']",20210302,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 1)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (HtrA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asthma/*blood', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 1/*analysis/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*analysis/blood', 'Male', 'Poland', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rhinitis, Allergic/*blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data together with episodical public reports on long-term surviving cancer patients who use methadone led to a hype of methadone as an anti-cancer drug in social and public media. However, clinical evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone is missing and prospective clinical trials, except in colorectal cancer, are not envisaged because of the limited preclinical data available. The present article reviews the pharmacokinetics, potential molecular targets, as well as the evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone in view of the therapeutically achievable doses in the brain.

Experimental studies showed the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects of TQ on different cancer cells. One of the possible mechanisms underlying these effects includes alteration in key metabolic pathways that are critical for cancer cell survival. However, an extensive landscape of the metabolites altered by TQ in cancer cells remains elusive. Here, we performed an untargeted metabolomics study using leukemic cancer cell lines during treatment with TQ and found alteration in approximately 335 metabolites. Pathway analysis showed alteration in key metabolic pathways like TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, which are critical for leukemic cell survival and death. We found a dramatic increase in metabolites like thymine glycol in TQ-treated cancer cells, a metabolite known to induce DNA damage and apoptosis. Similarly, we observed a sharp decline in cellular guanine levels, important for leukemic cancer cell survival. Overall, we provided an extensive metabolic landscape of leukemic cancer cells and identified the key metabolites and pathways altered, which could be critical and responsible for the anti-proliferative function of TQ.",,"['AlGhamdi, Asma Ahmed', 'Mohammed, Mohammed Razeeth Shait', 'Zamzami, Mazin A', 'Al-Malki, Abdulrahman L', 'Qari, Mohamad Hasan', 'Khan, Mohammad Imran', 'Choudhry, Hani']","['AlGhamdi AA', 'Mohammed MRS', 'Zamzami MA', 'Al-Malki AL', 'Qari MH', 'Khan MI', 'Choudhry H']","['Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Mutagenesis Research Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Hematology Department, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Mutagenesis Research Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Mutagenesis Research Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,PMC7353463,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'LC-MS/MS', 'leukemia', 'metabolism', 'metabolites', 'thymoquinone']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/03/02 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12061792 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12061792 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Jun 17;12(6). pii: nu12061792. doi: 10.3390/nu12061792.,,6,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4711-1483', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5832-5017', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0401-6619']",20210301,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*drug effects', 'Metabolomics/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapy outcomes are often compromised by the existence of a resistant AML phenotype associated with overexpression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters. Because AML induction therapy frequently consists of anthracycline-like drugs, their efficiency may also be diminished by drug biotransformation via carbonyl reducing enzymes (CRE). In this study, we investigated the modulatory potential of the CDK4/6 inhibitors abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib on AML resistance using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with de novo diagnosed AML. We first confirmed inhibitory effect of the tested drugs on ABCB1 and ABCG2 in ABC transporter-expressing resistant HL-60 cells while also showing the ability to sensitize the cells to cytotoxic drugs even as no effect on AML-relevant CRE isoforms was observed. All tested CDK4/6 inhibitors elevated mitoxantrone accumulations in CD34(+) PBMC and enhanced accumulation of mitoxantrone was found with abemaciclib and ribociclib in PBMC of FLT3-ITD(-) patients. Importantly, the accumulation rate in the presence of CDK4/6 inhibitors positively correlated with ABCB1 expression in CD34(+) patients and led to enhanced apoptosis of PBMC in contrast to CD34(-) samples. In summary, combination therapy involving CDK4/6 inhibitors could favorably target multidrug resistance, especially when personalized based on CD34- and ABCB1-related markers.",,"['Sorf, Ales', 'Sucha, Simona', 'Morell, Anselm', 'Novotna, Eva', 'Staud, Frantisek', 'Zavrelova, Alzbeta', 'Visek, Benjamin', 'Wsol, Vladimir', 'Ceckova, Martina']","['Sorf A', 'Sucha S', 'Morell A', 'Novotna E', 'Staud F', 'Zavrelova A', 'Visek B', 'Wsol V', 'Ceckova M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Sokolska 581, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Sokolska 581, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200616,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC7352292,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporters', 'CDK4/6 inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2020/06/21 06:01,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12061596 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12061596 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jun 16;12(6). pii: cancers12061596. doi: 10.3390/cancers12061596.,"['PRIMUS/20/MED/010/Univerzita Karlova v Praze', 'SVV/260-414/Univerzita Karlova v Praze', 'grant No. 20-20414Y/Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky', 'EFSA-CDN (grant No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000841)/Ministerstvo Skolstvi,', 'Mladeze a Telovychovy']",6,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-3980', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9190-458X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of a new host protein, PRMT5, in BLV infection. We found that PRMT5 is overexpressed only in BLV-infected cattle with a high proviral load, but not in those with a low proviral load. Furthermore, this upregulation continued to the lymphoma stage. PRMT5 expression was upregulated in response to experimental BLV infection; moreover, PRMT5 upregulation began in an early stage of BLV infection rather than after a long period of proviral latency. Second, siRNA-mediated PRMT5 knockdown enhanced BLV gene expression at the transcript and protein levels. Additionally, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of PRMT5 (CMP5) enhanced BLV gene expression. Interestingly, CMP5 treatment, but not siRNA knockdown, altered the gp51 glycosylation pattern and increased the molecular weight of gp51, thereby decreasing BLV-induced syncytium formation. This was supported by the observation that CMP5 treatment enhanced the formation of the complex type of N-glycan more than the high mannose type. In conclusion, PRMT5 overexpression is related to the development of BLV infection with a high proviral load and lymphoma stage and PRMT5 inhibition enhances BLV gene expression. This is the first study to investigate the role of PRMT5 in BLV infection in vivo and in vitro and to reveal a novel function for a small-molecule compound in BLV-gp51 glycosylation processing.",,"['Assi, Wlaa', 'Hirose, Tomoya', 'Wada, Satoshi', 'Matsuura, Ryosuke', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Assi W', 'Hirose T', 'Wada S', 'Matsuura R', 'Takeshima SN', 'Aida Y']","['Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, Jumonji University, Niiza, Saitama 352-8510, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone program, Riken Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200616,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,PMC7354529,['NOTNLM'],"['*BLV gene expression', '*PRMT5', '*PRMT5 inhibitor', '*bovine leukemia virus', '*glycosylation', '*gp51', '*proviral load', '*syncytia formation']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['v12060650 [pii]', '10.3390/v12060650 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Jun 16;12(6). pii: v12060650. doi: 10.3390/v12060650.,,6,,20210219,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*enzymology/genetics/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Giant Cells/enzymology/*virology', 'Glycosylation', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic benefits of allo-HSCT in malignant disorders are primarily derived from the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect, in which T cells in the donor graft recognize and eradicate residual malignant cells. However, the same donor T cells can also recognize normal host tissues as foreign, leading to the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which is difficult to separate from GvL and is the most frequent and serious complication following allo-HSCT. Inhibition of donor T cell toxicity helps in reducing GvHD but also restricts GvL activity. Therefore, developing a novel therapeutic strategy that selectively suppresses GvHD without affecting GvL is essential. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) not only inhibits the growth of tumor cells but also regulates the cytotoxic activity of T cells. Here, we compile the known therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors in preventing several stages of GvHD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we will also review the current clinical features of HDAC inhibitors in preventing and treating GvHD as well as maintaining GvL.",,"['Kim, Sena', 'Santhanam, Srikanth', 'Lim, Sora', 'Choi, Jaebok']","['Kim S', 'Santhanam S', 'Lim S', 'Choi J']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Independent Researcher, St. Louis, MO 63122, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200616,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7349873,['NOTNLM'],"['graft-versus-host disease', 'graft-versus-leukemia', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/02/16 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21124281 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21124281 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 16;21(12). pii: ijms21124281. doi: 10.3390/ijms21124281.,,12,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6930-2416', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5746-264X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5590-087X']",20210215,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/metabolism/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the physical properties such as the motility of the cells contribute to the survival of ALL cells after drug treatment has recently been of increasing interest, as they could potentially allow the metastasis of solid tumor cells and the migration of leukemia cells. We hypothesized that chemotherapeutic treatment may alter these physical cellular properties. To investigate the motility of chemotherapeutics-treated B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cells, patient-derived B-ALL cells were treated with chemotherapy for 7 days and left for 12 h without chemotherapeutic treatment. Two parameters of motility were studied, velocity and migration distance, using a time-lapse imaging system. The study revealed that compared to non-chemotherapeutically treated B-ALL cells, B-ALL cells that survived chemotherapy treatment after 7 days showed reduced motility. We had previously shown that Tysabri and P5G10, antibodies against the adhesion molecules integrins alpha4 and alpha6, respectively, may overcome drug resistance mediated through leukemia cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells. Therefore, we tested the effect of integrin alpha4 or alpha6 blockade on the motility of chemotherapeutics-treated ALL cells. Only integrin alpha4 blockade decreased the motility and velocity of two chemotherapeutics-treated ALL cell lines. Interestingly, integrin alpha6 blockade did not affect the velocity of chemoresistant ALL cells. This study explores the physical properties of the movements of chemoresistant B-ALL cells and highlights a potential link to integrins. Further studies to investigate the underlying mechanism are warranted.",,"['Liu, Hsiao-Chuan', 'Gang, Eun Ji', 'Kim, Hye Na', 'Ruan, Yongsheng', 'Ogana, Heather', 'Wan, Zesheng', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Shung, K Kirk', 'Kim, Yong-Mi']","['Liu HC', 'Gang EJ', 'Kim HN', 'Ruan Y', 'Ogana H', 'Wan Z', 'Bonig H', 'Shung KK', 'Kim YM']","['Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Goethe University School of Medicine, Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98198, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200616,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC7349263,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cell motility', '*chemotherapeutics-treated', '*integrins', '*time-lapse imaging']",,2020/06/21 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/06/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9061470 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9061470 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jun 16;9(6). pii: cells9061470. doi: 10.3390/cells9061470.,['R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],6,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5410-8821', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7475-2059']",20210407,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', '*Time-Lapse Imaging/methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circular RNA ribosomal protein L15 (circ-RPL15) is involved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, its expression and functions in GC remain elusive. METHODS: The expression of circ-RPL15 in human GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, human gastric cancer cell lines (MGC-803, BGC-823, MGN-28, SGC-7901, AGS) and normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line (GES-1) were detected by RT-PCR. The relationship between circ-RPL15 level and clinical-pathological indicators were also analyzed. Gain- of function experiments of circ-RPL15 and miR-502-3p were conducted to verify their roles in mediating GC cell proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis. Also, the downstream mechanisms of circ-RPL15 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and the interactions between circ-RPL15 and miR-502-3p, miR-502-3p and OLFM4 were verified by dual luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA FISH. RESULTS: circ-RPL15 was upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, and the overexpressed circ-RPL15 was correlated with poorer survival of GC patients. Functionally, circ-RPL15 upregulation distinctly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells and inhibited apoptosis. Mechanistically, circ-RPL15 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA via sponging miR-502-3p and activated OLFM4/STAT3 pathway. CONCLUSION: circ-RPL15 promotes GC progression and predicts poor prognosis of GC patients, and regulates the malignant phenotypes of GC cells by mediating the miR-502-3p/OLFM4/STAT3 axis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

However, little is known about disease burden in high-income Arab countries offering free-of-charge healthcare. The hypothesis was that, due to population characteristics (young age, high fertility and parental consanguinity rate), the incidence of cALL in Saudi Arabia is equal or higher than that observed in high-income Western countries. METHODS: Saudi databases were used to calculate the incidence of cALL from 2001 to 2014. Incidence trends over time of children with ALL, 14-years of age or younger, were analyzed and compared with those reported in USA. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence over the years was lower in Saudi Arabia compared to USA. However, the incidence trend of cALL in Saudi Arabia was increasing at a rate higher than that observed in USA (p < 0.001). The overall incidence of cALL in Saudi Arabia increased from 1.58/100,000 in 2001 to 2.35/100,000 population in 2014. The median annual increase was 4.58 %. The incidence in males increased from 1.88 to 2.71/100,000, and from 1.21 to 1.86/100,000 population in females. CONCLUSIONS: The reported incidence of cALL in Saudi Arabia is rapidly increasing. The increasing trend may reflect evolving socioeconomic structure, improved access-to-cancer care, and improved diagnosis/ reporting capacity. This highlights the need for better understanding of cALL causes and the need for the formation of separate national pediatric cancer registries in different countries to monitor childhood cancer incidence trends.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the cytotoxic potential of a naturally occurring N-acetylglycoside of oleanolic acid, aridanin, on 18 cancer cell lines, including sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes mediated by P-glycoprotein, BCRP, p53 knockout, deletion-mutated EGFR, or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, metastasizing B16/F10 cells, HepG2 hepatocarcinoma and normal AML12 hepatocytes were investigated. The mechanisms of aridanin-induced cell death was further investigated. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay (RRA) was applied to evaluate the cytotoxicity, autophagy, ferroptotic and necroptotic cell death. CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were used for all mechanistic studies. A caspase-Glo assay was applied to evaluate the caspase activities. Flow cytometry was applied for the analyses of cell cycle (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS; H2DCFH-DA). RESULTS: Aridanin and doxorubicin (positive control) inhibited the proliferation of all cancer cell lines tested. The IC50 values for aridanin varied from 3.18 microM (CCRF-CEM cells) to 9.56 microM (HepG2 cells). Aridanin had considerably lower IC50 values than that of doxorubicin against multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells and melanoma cell lines (MaMel-80a, Mel-2a, MV3, and SKMel-505). Aridanin induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells through increase of ROS levels and MMP breakdown, and to a lesser extent via caspases activation. Aridanin also induced ferroptotic and necroptotic cell death. CONCLUSION: The present study opens good perpectives for the use of this phytochemical as an anticancer drug to combat multi-facorial resistance to established chemotherapeutics.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier GmbH.

We obtained a high-resolution co-crystal structure of the CBP bromodomain in complex with DC-CPin7 to guide following structure-based rational drug design, which yielded over ten DC-CPin7 derivatives with much higher potency, among which DC-CPin711 showed approximately 40-fold potency compared with hit compound DC-CPin7 with an in vitro TR-FRET IC50 value of 63.3 +/- 4.0 nM. Notably, DC-CPin711 showed over 150-fold selectivity against BRD4 bromodomains. Moreover, DC-CPin711 showed micromolar level of anti-leukemia proliferation through G1 phase cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. In summary, through a combination of computational and crystal-based structure optimization, DC-CPin711 showed potent in vitro inhibitory activities to CBP bromodomain with a decent selectivity towards BRD4 bromodomains and good cellular activity to leukemia cells, which could further be applied to related biological and translational studies as well as serve as a lead compound for future development of potent and selective CBP bromodomain inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

METHODS: A cohort study including all patients initiating ibrutinib between 21 November 2014 and 21 November 2018, and followed for 1 year was conducted. Patient characteristics, ibrutinib use and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were collected from medical records. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the probability of developing ibrutinib-associated serious ADRs (SADRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate factors associated with SADR occurrence. RESULTS: In total, 102 patients were included in the study. The median age was 70.3 years (interquartile range 64.7-75.6), the male/female gender ratio was 2.9. Almost half the patients (47.1%) were prescribed ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Forty-three patients (42.1%) permanently discontinued ibrutinib in the first year, mostly for progression (51.2%) or ADRs (32.6%). Forty-eight patients (47.1%) experienced at least one ibrutinib-associated SADR. Haematological, infectious and vascular disorders were the most frequent SADRs. The probability of developing ibrutinib-associated SADR was 35.1% (95% CI 26.3-45.7%) at 3 months, 44.8% (35.2%; 55.8%) at 6 months and 54.3% (44.0%; 65.2%) at 12 months. Age >/=80 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; 95% CI 1.02-4.05) and CLL (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.01-3.25) were significantly associated with a higher risk of SADR occurrence. CONCLUSION: This study found a high cumulative incidence of ibrutinib-associated SADRs within the first year of treatment. In view of the risk of SADR, patients aged >/=80 years or treated for CLL deserve special attention.",['(c) 2020 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Allouchery, Marion', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Guidez, Stephanie', 'Delwail, Vincent', 'Delaunay, Paul', 'Lafay-Chebassier, Claire', 'Salvo, Francesco', 'Perault-Pochat, Marie-Christine']","['Allouchery M', 'Tomowiak C', 'Guidez S', 'Delwail V', 'Delaunay P', 'Lafay-Chebassier C', 'Salvo F', 'Perault-Pochat MC']","['Pharmacologie Clinique et Vigilances, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Onco-Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Onco-Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Onco-Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Pharmacologie Clinique et Vigilances, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Pharmacologie Clinique et Vigilances, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Neurosciences Experimentales et Cliniques, INSERM U1084, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, Pharmacoepidemiology research team, INSERM U1219, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Pharmacologie Medicale, Pole de Sante Publique, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Pharmacologie Clinique et Vigilances, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Neurosciences Experimentales et Cliniques, INSERM U1084, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200705,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,,['NOTNLM'],"['*anticancer drugs', '*drug safety', '*pharmacoepidemiology', '*pharmacovigilance']",,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14440 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2021 Mar;87(3):895-904. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14440.

This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compares the efficacy and safety of imatinib vs second-generation (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) and third-generation TKIs (ponatinib) in adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ CP CML, concentrating on OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and hematological and nonhematological adverse events. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. Seven RCTs published between 1990 and 2019 (involving 3262 participants) satisfied the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs (imatinib vs nilotinib and imatinib vs dasatinib) found no difference in 5-year OS or PFS.

Targeted therapy is in need to tackle challenges in the treatment perspective. A growing body of evidence suggests a promising role of pharmacological inhibition of PIM (proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus) kinase in some human haematological and solid cancers. Yet to date, the potential application of PIM inhibitors in HCC is still largely unexplored. In the present study we investigated the pre-clinical efficacy of PIM inhibition as a therapeutic approach in HCC. Effects of PIM inhibitors on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, chemosensitivity, and self-renewal were examined in vitro. The effects of PIM inhibitors on tumour growth and chemoresistance in vivo were studied using xenograft mouse models. Potential downstream molecular mechanisms were elucidated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of tumour tissues harvested from animal models. Our findings demonstrate that PIM inhibitors SGI-1776 and PIM447 reduced HCC proliferation, metastatic potential, and self-renewal in vitro. Results from in vivo experiments supported the role of PIM inhibition in suppressing of tumour growth and increasing chemosensitivity of HCC toward cisplatin and doxorubicin, the two commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in trans-arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for HCC. RNA-seq analysis revealed downregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway upon PIM inhibition in HCC cells. In addition, LOXL2 and ICAM1 were identified as potential downstream effectors. Taken together, PIM inhibitors demonstrated remarkable anti-tumourigenic effects in HCC in vitro and in vivo. PIM kinase inhibition is a potential approach to be exploited in formulating adjuvant therapy for HCC patients of different disease stages. (c) 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

In this study, we investigated the effects of human-derived low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and HDL-associated proteins apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and serum amyloid A (SAA) on markers of viability, cholesterol flux, and differentiation in K562 cells-a bone marrow-derived, stem-like erythroleukemia cell model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We further evaluated whether lipoprotein-mediated effects were altered by concomitant LXR activation. We observed that LDL promoted higher K562 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased cellular cholesterol concentrations, while LXR activation by the agonist TO901317 ablated these effects. LXR activation in the presence of HDL, apoA1 and SAA-rich HDL suppressed K562 cell viability, while robustly inducing mRNA expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). HDL and its associated proteins additionally suppressed mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-xL), and the erythroid lineage marker 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), while SAA-rich HDL induced mRNA expression of the megakaryocytic lineage marker integrin subunit alpha 2b (ITGA2B).

However, there is considerable interpatient variability in clearance of high-dose (HD) MTX. Patients with delayed clearance are at an increased risk for severe nephrotoxicity and life-threatening systemic MTX exposure. Glucarpidase is a rescue agent for severe MTX toxicity that reduces plasma MTX levels via hydrolysis of MTX into inactive metabolites, but is only indicated when MTX concentrations are > 2 SDs above the mean excretion curve specific for the given dose together with a significant creatinine increase (> 50%). Appropriate administration of glucarpidase is challenging due to the ambiguity in the labeled indication. A recent consensus guideline was published with an algorithm to provide clarity in when to administer glucarpidase, yet clinical interpretation of laboratory results that do not directly correspond to the algorithm prove to be a limitation of its use. The goal of our study was to develop a clinical decision support tool to optimize the administration of glucarpidase for patients receiving HD MTX. Here, we describe the development of a novel 3-compartment MTX population pharmacokinetic (PK) model using 31,672 MTX plasma concentrations from 772 pediatric patients receiving HD MTX for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its integration into the online clinical decision support tool, MTXPK.org. This web-based tool has the functionality to utilize individualized demographics, serum creatinine, and real-time drug concentrations to predict the elimination profile and facilitate model-informed administration of glucarpidase.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Ethnicity was analyzed by subgroup analysis. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis, including 4,682 children with ALL and 7144 controls. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the comparison of population of allele model, dominant gene model, recessive gene model, homozygous gene model, heterozygous gene model, and the comparison of Caucasian children. The results of the Asian child analysis suggested that the combined OR of the dominant gene model (CC + CT versus TT), homozygous model (CC versus TT) and heterozygous model (CT versus TT) was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.70), 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.84), and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.01-1.59), respectively, with statistically significant differences. However, there was no significant difference between the allele model and recessive gene model among Asian children. CONCLUSION: The MTHFR C677T polymorphism is related to ALL in children, especially in Asian children. CC + CT, CC, and CT genotypes can increase the risk of ALL, but no association has been found in Caucasian children.",,"['Li, Yu', 'Pei, Yu-Xin', 'Wang, Li-Na', 'Liang, Cong', 'Tang, Yan-Lai', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong']","['Li Y', 'Pei YX', 'Wang LN', 'Liang C', 'Tang YL', 'Zhang XL', 'Huang LB', 'Luo XQ', 'Ke ZY']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['186e14b9417da291,7a78de0f4f049d77 [pii]', '10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2020033468 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2020;30(2):125-136. doi: 10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2020033468.,,2,,20210709,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Whites/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed structure-based computational database screening using the 3D structure of the JAK3 kinase domain and the National Cancer Institute diversity set and identified tubulosine as a novel JAK3 inhibitor. Tubulosine directly blocked the catalytic activity of JAK3 by selective interacting with the JAK3 kinase domain. Consistently, tubulosine potently inhibited persistently activated and interleukin-2-dependent JAK3, and JAK3-mediated downstream targets. Importantly, it did not affect the activity of other JAK family members, particularly prolactin-induced JAK2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and interferon alpha-induced JAK1-TYK2/STAT1. Tubulosine specifically decreased survival and proliferation of cancer cells, in which persistently active JAK3 is expressed, by inducing apoptotic and necrotic/autophagic cell death without affecting other oncogenic signalling. Collectively, tubulosine is a potential small-molecule compound that selectively inhibits JAK3 activity, suggesting that it may serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating disorders caused by aberrant activation of JAK3 signalling.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Low to moderate levels of CIN are well tolerated and can promote cancer proliferation. However, high levels of CIN are lethal. Thus, CIN may serve both as a prognostic factor to predict clinical outcome and as a predictive biomarker. A retrospective study was performed to evaluate CIN in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chromosome mis-segregation frequency was correlated with clinical outcome in bone marrow core biopsy specimens from 17 AML cases. Additionally, we induced chromosome segregation errors in AML cell lines with AZ3146, an inhibitor of the Mps1 mitotic checkpoint kinase, to quantify the phenotypic effects of high CIN. We observed a broad distribution of chromosome mis-segregation frequency in AML bone marrow core specimens. High CIN correlated with complex karyotype in AML, as expected, although there was no clear survival effect.

Patients had at least 1 feature of AP: blasts >/=15% (n = 2), basophils >/=20% (n = 19), platelets <100 x 10(9) /L (n = 7), cytogenetic clonal evolution (n = 34), or more than one factor (n = 13). Thirty-three patients received imatinib; 42 received a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (2GTKI) (19 dasatinib and 23 nilotinib). We used chi-square and Kaplan-Meier analyses to determine the impact of various degrees of molecular and cytogenetic response at early time points (3 and 6 months) on rates of overall cytogenetic and molecular response, overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), and failure-free survival (FFS). After a median follow-up of 96 months (range: 18-224 months), the overall rate of complete cytogenetic response was 79%, of major molecular response, 71%, and of molecular reponse (MR)4.5, 59%. Patients who achieved a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (n = 49) at 3 months had significantly better 3-year OS (94% vs 75%; P = .002), TFS (98% vs 73%; P < .001), EFS (93% vs 42%; P < .001), and FFS (83% vs 25%; P < .001) rates than patients who did not have MCyR at 3 months. Most (67%) who eventually achieved sustained MR4.5 had achieved MCyR at 3 months.

In this review, we discuss our current understanding of Notch signaling in mammalian innate and adaptive immunity. The importance of Notch signaling is pervasive throughout the immune system, as it elicits lineage and context-dependent effects in a wide repertoire of cells. Although regulation of binary cell fate decisions encompasses many of the functions first ascribed to Notch in the immune system, recent advances in the field have refined and expanded our view of the Notch pathway beyond this initial concept. From establishing T cell identity in the thymus to regulating mature T cell function in the periphery, the Notch pathway is an essential, recurring signal for the T cell lineage. Among B cells, Notch signaling is required for the development and maintenance of marginal zone B cells in the spleen. Emerging roles for Notch signaling in innate and innate-like lineages such as classical dendritic cells and innate lymphoid cells are likewise coming into view. Lastly, we speculate on the molecular underpinnings that shape the activity and versatility of the Notch pathway.",['(c)2020 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Vanderbeck, Ashley', 'Maillard, Ivan']","['Vanderbeck A', 'Maillard I']","['Immunology Graduate Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Veterinary Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Immunology Graduate Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200618,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*T cells', '*dendritic cells', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*innate lymphoid cells', '*stromal cells']",,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.1RI0520-138R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2021 Mar;109(3):535-548. doi: 10.1002/JLB.1RI0520-138R.

The present study aimed to determine whether BaP-induced AhR activation results in development of airway inflammation. Initially, the potential for a direct relationship between BaP-induced AhR activation and airway inflammation was investigated in vivo, using a mouse model of type 2 helper T cell (Th2) hapten toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI)-induced airway inflammation. Mice were orally administered BaP at 48, 24, and 4 h before the final allergen challenge. Oral administration of BaP showed a significant increase in lung inflammation and eosinophil infiltration. While expression of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 was not affected by exposure to BaP, AhR activation significantly increased IL-33 expression. To confirm the in vivo results, in vitro experiments were performed using the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line (EOL-1), human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B), and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549). Results indicated that pre-treatment with BaP increased expression of IL-8 in house dust mite-activated EOL-1, BEAS-2B, and A549 cells. In addition, IL-33 levels in BEAS-2B cells were significantly increased after BaP exposure.

The questionnaire consisted of 52 multiple-choice questions covering prophylactic measures, screening and diagnostic tests, empirical antibiotic therapy, antifungal management, the usage of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus during intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Questions associated with antimicrobial stewardship were also included. Usable responses were received from 163 of 218 (74.8%) institutions. Approximately, half (52.2%) of the institutes did not have infectious disease department. As antibiotic prophylaxis, fluoroquinolones (62%) were most commonly used in induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. No prophylaxis accounted for 19% of the institutions, which has gradually increased compared to previous surveys. In empirical antibiotic therapy for febrile neutropenia, monotherapy with beta-lactam antibiotics was the most commonly used first-line therapy.

METHODS: A 19-year-old patient underwent ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) before cord blood transplantation in 2010. She was diagnosed as ALL with a bone marrow biopsy revealing 90% blast ALL-L2 type, and karyotype analyses indicated reciprocal translocation at t(9;22)(q34;q11). The patient received the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocol, and complete remission was achieved before fertility preservation. Serum AMH level was measured as 1.5 ng/ml, and 12 antral follicles were counted on ultrasound. She was informed about fertility preservation options and decided to proceed with OTC, with her signed consent before cord blood transplantation in April 2011. Ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) was performed in 2017 when the patient was menopausal with serum FSH levels > 100 IU/ml and estradiol < 20 pg/ml and hematologically in molecular remission. Detailed molecular analysis, standard histology, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the thawed tissue is free of malignant cells. RESULTS: Six months following OTT, she had spontaneous menstruation with serum FSH 11 IU/ml and estradiol 53 pg/ml. Two consecutive IVF cycles yielded three top-quality embryos. Following three embryo transfer cycles, one fresh and two frozen, a healthy term live birth was achieved. Frozen-thawed-transplanted tissues were extracted during caesarean delivery upon the patient's request after a total period of 25 months in vivo, and histopathological evaluation revealed that the tissue was free of leukemic infiltration. CONCLUSION: The authors report the first pregnancy and live birth in Turkey and the second live birth in the world following transplantation of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue in a leukemia survivor.

METHODS: A total of 250 childhood ALL survivors were eligible to undergo a CPET on ergocycle. Analyses were performed in 216 survivors and stratified in regard to their prognostic risk groups: 99 survivors (55 males and 44 females) at standard risk and 117 survivors (56 males and 61 females) at high risk. RESULTS: Results showed that 100% (n = 216) of survivors completed a maximal CPET confirmed by the achievement of two out of three of the following criteria: 197 survivors (91.2%) reached a peak RER value of >/= 1.15, 197 survivors (91.2%) reached a RPE score > 7, and 210 survivors (97.2%) reached a maximal heart rate >/= 85% of the predicted value. Linear regression analysis showed a significant association between the survivors' cumulative dose of doxorubicin and their VO2 peak measured. Two non-fatal adverse events were observed and reported at the end of the maximal CPET, while non-fatal adverse events were reported in 5 survivors during the recovery period. None of these events resulted in a long-term complication. CONCLUSION: Childhood ALL survivors with prior exposure to chemotherapy can achieve a safe maximal CPET. They were able of achieving a maximal exercise test without being limited by symptoms, potential overprotection, or musculoskeletal issues. Thus, it should be the norm to realize a CPET prior a physical activity program to propose an optimal prescription. This study provides important information regarding the maximal physiological parameters that childhood ALL survivors are able to reach and have important clinical implications in the exercise and oncology field for this population of survivors.",,"['Caru, Maxime', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Lemay, Valerie', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Andelfinger, Gregor', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Caru M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Lemay V', 'Drouin S', 'Bertout L', 'Krajinovic M', 'Andelfinger G', 'Sinnett D', 'Curnier D']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430 - Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), Department of Psychology, University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer treatments', 'Cardiopulmonary exercise test', 'Evidence-based medicine', 'Exercise oncology', 'Maximal exercise test', 'Survivorship']",,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05582-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05582-y [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Feb;29(2):987-996. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05582-y.

However, HSCT can induce significant long-term complications. Therefore, we investigated the late complications and risk factors for quality of life (QOL) post-HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 67 adult survivors over 2 years after HSCT between 2015 and 2018 at Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, Korea. The survey data including FACT-BMT, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and NCCN Distress Thermometer were collected as patient-reported outcomes using a tablet PC during a routine practice of survivorship clinic. RESULTS: The median age was 46 years. The most common symptom was fatigue (80.6%). Younger age (< 60 years), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and immunosuppressant use were significantly associated with worse QOL and depression. Additionally, younger survivors (< 60 years) showed significantly more fatigue and anxiety compared with elderly survivors (>/= 60 years). Female sex was significantly associated with lower physical well-being and higher distress than male sex. CONCLUSION: Younger patients (< 60 years), female, ALL, chronic GVHD, and continuous immunosuppressant use were significant risk factors for worse QOL and depression.

The reasons why frequent CT scans are taken in a specific child remain unclear. The present study aimed to clarify the medical reasons why frequent CT examinations in children, and the characteristics of the diseases of those children that required multiple CT scans. A long-term follow-up retrospective study was conducted over a 12.75-year period at a single institution. Radiological reports were investigated that contained the indications for the CT scans. The clinical indications were classified for the examination of children under 16 years of age who underwent more than three CT scans into trauma, tumor, inflammation, and others. This study showed that 8.5% of CT examinations were done three times or more. The numbers of patients by indication were 23.3% for trauma, 5.3% for hydrocephalus, and 2.3% for appendicitis. The frequencies of trauma and inflammation decreased rapidly with an increasing number of CT scans. In particular, hydrocephalus brought high frequency more than ten scans. Regarding the frequencies of clinical indications by age groups, there was a significant difference (p<0.05). The near-13-year follow-up study indicated the main clinical indications for frequent CT scans in children were trauma and hydrocephalus. Multiple follow-up CT scans in children with hydrocephalus would be traded off against the resultant increase in brain tumor risk associated with CT exposure.",,"['Yoshitake, Takayasu', 'Ono, Koji', 'Ishiguchi, Tsuneo', 'Maeda, Toru', 'Kai, Michiaki']","['Yoshitake T', 'Ono K', 'Ishiguchi T', 'Maeda T', 'Kai M']","['Shinbeppu Hospital, 3898 Tsurumi, Beppu City, Oita Prefecture, 874-0833, Japan. yoshitake14@gm.oita-nhs.ac.jp.', 'Oita University of Nursing and Hearth Sciences, 2944-9 Megusuno, Oita, Oita, Japan. yoshitake14@gm.oita-nhs.ac.jp.', 'Tokyo Healthcare University, 3-11-3 Setagaya, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Aichi Medical University Hospital, 1-1 Yazakokarimata, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Oita Prefectural Hospital, 476 Bunyo, Oita, Oita, Japan.', 'Oita University of Nursing and Hearth Sciences, 2944-9 Megusuno, Oita, Oita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200618,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CT examinations', '*Childhood cancer', '*Clinical indications', '*Radiation exposure']",,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00411-020-00857-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00411-020-00857-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2020 Aug;59(3):407-414. doi: 10.1007/s00411-020-00857-8.

METHODS: In the trial, we distributed 1767 questionnaires and 1045 were returned. We adopted a regression discontinuing design and estimated the change in response rate between pre-intervention (quality-of-life questionnaires were sent to each center soon after patient registration) and post-intervention (a set of tailored questionnaires was sent just before the first quality-of-life assessment). RESULTS: The post-intervention response rate was higher (odds ratio = 1.62) than the pre-intervention response rate.

Because this is primarily caused by chemotherapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs), it is essential to eradicate LSCs to improve patient survival. LSCs have predominantly been studied at the transcript level, thus information about posttranscriptionally regulated genes and associated networks is lacking. Here, we extend our previous report on LSC proteomes to healthy age-matched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and correlate the proteomes to the corresponding transcriptomes. By comparing LSCs to leukemic blasts and healthy HSPCs, we validate candidate LSC markers and highlight novel and potentially targetable proteins that are absent or only lowly expressed in HSPCs. In addition, our data provide strong evidence that LSCs harbor a characteristic energy metabolism, adhesion molecule composition, as well as RNA-processing properties. Furthermore, correlating proteome and transcript data of the same individual samples highlights the strength of proteome analyses, which are particularly potent in detecting alterations in metabolic pathways. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of functionally validated LSCs, blasts, and healthy HSPCs, representing a valuable resource helping to design LSC-directed therapies.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Raffel, Simon', 'Klimmeck, Daniel', 'Falcone, Mattia', 'Demir, Aykut', 'Pouya, Alireza', 'Zeisberger, Petra', 'Lutz, Christoph', 'Tinelli, Marco', 'Bischel, Oliver', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Florcken, Anne', 'Westermann, Jorg', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Gu, Zuguang', 'Herrmann, Carl', 'Krijgsveld, Jeroen', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Hansson, Jenny']","['Raffel S', 'Klimmeck D', 'Falcone M', 'Demir A', 'Pouya A', 'Zeisberger P', 'Lutz C', 'Tinelli M', 'Bischel O', 'Bullinger L', 'Thiede C', 'Florcken A', 'Westermann J', 'Ehninger G', 'Ho AD', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Gu Z', 'Herrmann C', 'Krijgsveld J', 'Trumpp A', 'Hansson J']","['Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM) GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'DKFZ Center for Molecular Biology Heidelberg (DKFZ-ZMBH) Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM) GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'DKFZ Center for Molecular Biology Heidelberg (DKFZ-ZMBH) Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM) GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'DKFZ Center for Molecular Biology Heidelberg (DKFZ-ZMBH) Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM) GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'DKFZ Center for Molecular Biology Heidelberg (DKFZ-ZMBH) Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Praxis fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Koblenz, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, Sinsheim Hospital, Sinsheim, Germany.', 'BG Trauma Center Ludwigshafen at Heidelberg University Hospital, Ludwigshafen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medical Department 1, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medical Department 1, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Health Data Science Unit, Medical Faculty Heidelberg, and.', 'Bioquant Center, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Proteomics of Stem Cells and Cancer, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medical Faculty, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM) GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'DKFZ Center for Molecular Biology Heidelberg (DKFZ-ZMBH) Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK);

We investigated adding haplo-identical CD34+ cells to dCB grafts to facilitate early haplo-identical donor-derived neutrophil recovery (optimal bridging) prior to CB engraftment. Seventy-eight adults underwent myeloablation with cyclosporine-A/mycophenolate mofetil immunoprophylaxis (no antithymocyte globulin, ATG). CB units (median CD34+ dose 1.1 x 10(5)/kg/unit) had a median 5/8 unit-recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-match. Haplo-identical grafts had a median CD34+ dose of 5.2 x 10(6)/kg. Of 77 evaluable patients, 75 had sustained CB engraftment that was mediated by a dominant unit and heralded by dominant unit-derived T cells. Optimal haplo-identical donor-derived myeloid bridging was observed in 34/77 (44%) patients (median recovery 12 days). Other engrafting patients had transient bridging with second nadir preceding CB engraftment (20/77 (26%), median first recovery 12 and second 26.5 days) or no bridge (21/77 (27%), median recovery 25 days). The 2 (3%) remaining patients had graft failure. Higher haplo-CD34+ dose and better dominant unit-haplo-CD34+ HLA-match significantly improved the likelihood of optimal bridging. Optimally bridged patients were discharged earlier (median 28 versus 36 days). ATG-free haplo-dCBT can speed neutrophil recovery but successful bridging is not guaranteed due to rapid haplo-identical graft rejection.",,"['Politikos, Ioannis', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Arcila, Maria E',

HSCs self-renewal divisions in stem cells are required for rapid regeneration during tissue damage and stress, but how precisely intracellular calcium signals are regulated to maintain fate options in normal hematopoiesis is unclear. S100A6 knockout (KO) HSCs have reduced total cell numbers in the HSC compartment, decreased myeloid output, and increased apoptotic HSC numbers in steady state. S100A6KO HSCs had impaired self-renewal and regenerative capacity, not responding to 5-Fluorouracil. Our transcriptomic and proteomic profiling suggested that S100A6 is a critical HSC regulator. Intriguingly, S100A6KO HSCs showed decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and Hsp90, with an impairment of mitochondrial respiratory capacity and a reduction of mitochondrial calcium levels. We showed that S100A6 regulates intracellular and mitochondria calcium buffering of HSC upon cytokine stimulation and have demonstrated that Akt activator SC79 reverts the levels of intracellular and mitochondrial calcium in HSC. Hematopoietic colony-forming activity and the Hsp90 activity of S100A6KO are restored through activation of the Akt pathway.

It has been recognized as the most common cause underlying primary MDS in children. Triggered by the discovery of a recurrent synonymous GATA2 variant, we systematically investigated 911 patients with phenotype of pediatric MDS or cellular deficiencies for the presence of synonymous alterations in GATA2. In total, we identified nine individuals with five heterozygous synonymous mutations: c.351C>G, p.T117T (N = 4); c.649C>T, p.L217L; c.981G>A, p.G327G; c.1023C>T, p.A341A; and c.1416G>A, p.P472P (N = 2). They accounted for 8.2% (9/110) of cases with GATA2 deficiency in our cohort and resulted in selective loss of mutant RNA. While for the hotspot mutation (c.351C>G) a splicing error leading to RNA and protein reduction was identified, severe, likely late stage RNA loss without splicing disruption was found for other mutations. Finally, the synonymous mutations did not alter protein function or stability. In summary, synonymous GATA2 substitutions are a new common cause of GATA2 deficiency. These findings have broad implications for genetic counseling and pathogenic variant discovery in Mendelian disorders.",,"['Kozyra, Emilia J', 'Pastor, Victor B', 'Lefkopoulos, Stylianos', 'Sahoo,

We performed targeted deep sequencing combined with mapping of HTLV-1 proviral integration sites of 61 ATL patients of African and Caribbean origin. This revealed mutations mainly affecting TCR/NF-kB (74%), T-cell trafficking (46%), immune escape (29%), and cell cycle (26%) related pathways, consistent with the genomic landscape previously reported in a large Japanese cohort. To examine the evolution of mutational signatures upon disease progression while tracking the viral integration architecture of the malignant clone, we carried out a longitudinal study of patients who either relapsed or progressed from an indolent to an aggressive subtype. Serial analysis of relapsing patients identified several patterns of clonal evolution. In progressing patients, the longitudinal study revealed NF-kB/NFAT mutations at progression that were present at a subclonal level at diagnosis (allelic frequency < 5%). Moreover, the presence in indolent subtypes of mutations affecting the TCR/NF-kB pathway, whether clonal or subclonal, was associated with significantly shorter time to progression and overall survival. Our observations reveal the clonal dynamics of ATL mutational signatures at relapse and during progression. Our study defines a new subgroup of indolent ATLs characterized by a mutational signature at high risk of transformation.",,"['Marcais, Ambroise', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Artesi, Maria', 'Laurent,

However, response to vaccines has been investigated in a small series of CLL patients. We analyzed the antibody response and outcomes of 112 CLL patients who received the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). An immune response was defined by a twofold increase in the PC-IgG levels assessed by ELISA. The median age of patients was 68 years, 23.2% showed IgG levels </= 400 mg/L, 6.3% progressive disease, 52% unmutated IGHV. Twenty-two (19.6%) patients were treatment-naive and 90 (80.4%) previously treated (40.2% front-line chemoimmunotherapy; ibrutinib first/advanced-line, 9.8%/21.4%; idelalisib advanced-line, 8.9%). Nine (8%) patients developed an immune response, eight treatment-naive, and one on front-line ibrutinib. No responses were observed in patients previously treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Age >/= 60 years (p = 0.007), IgG levels < 400 mg/L (p < 0.0001), prior treatment (p < 0.0001), and signs of disease progression (p = 0.04) were associated with a lower response rate. Pneumonia-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with clinical signs of progressive disease (HR, 8.39), prior pneumonia (HR, 7.03), and TP53 disruption (HR, 2.91). In conclusion, our results suggest that vaccination should be offered at diagnosis to CLL patients with early stage and stable disease who have better resources for an effective immune response.",,"['Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Galluzzo, Clementina Maria', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Riemma, Costantino', 'Rosati, Serena', 'Porrazzo, Marika', 'Pepe, Sara', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Raponi, Sara', 'Micozzi, Alessandra', 'Gentile, Giuseppe', 'Baroncelli, Silvia']","['Mauro FR', 'Giannarelli D', 'Galluzzo CM', 'Vitale C', 'Visentin A', 'Riemma C', 'Rosati S', 'Porrazzo M', 'Pepe S', 'Coscia M', 'Trentin L', 'Gentile M', 'Raponi S', 'Micozzi A', 'Gentile G', 'Baroncelli S']","[""Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, 'Sapienza' University, Rome, Italy. mauro@bce.uniroma1.it."", 'Biostatistic Unit, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'National Center for Global Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

An integral aspect of this is to define the physiological age and capacity of patients with MM to deal with the burden of their disease and it's treatment. Such assessments may include not only functional and clinical assessments but also laboratory-based biomarkers of frailty, aging and senescent cellular burden. A need to develop, test and validate clinical screening scores before their adoption into clinical practice is mandated.

Here, we developed a comprehensive approach combining a variety of molecular and clinical data to pinpoint translocation events disrupting long-range chromatin interactions and causing cancer-relevant transcriptional deregulation. Thereby, we discovered a B cell specific cis-regulatory element restricting the expression of genes in the associated locus, including PRMT5 and DAD1, two factors with oncogenic potential. Experimental PRMT5 inhibition identified transcriptional programs similar to those in patients with differences in PRMT5 abundance, especially MYC-driven and stress response pathways. In turn, such inhibition impairs factors involved in DNA repair, sensitizing cells for apoptosis. Moreover, we show that artificial deletion of the regulatory element from its endogenous context resulted in upregulation of corresponding genes, including PRMT5. Furthermore, such disruption renders PRMT5 transcription vulnerable to additional stimuli and subsequently alters the expression of downstream PRMT5 targets. These studies provide a mechanism of PRMT5 deregulation in CLL and the molecular dependencies identified might have therapeutic implementations.",,"['Schnormeier, Ann-Kathrin', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Koeppel, Max']","['Schnormeier AK', 'Pommerenke C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Drexler HG', 'Koeppel M']","['Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology (Tumor Research), University of Duisburg-Essen, Medical School, Duisburg, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany. max.koeppel@dsmz.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200617,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC7299935,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-66224-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-66224-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jun 17;10(1):9775. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-66224-1.,,1,,20201208,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DAD1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Epigenomics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Stress, Physiological', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is potentially life-threatening, and diagnosis of the underlying disease is a challenge. Despite laboratory improvements, many cases remain idiopathic. We aimed to analyze clinical and laboratory findings of 309 erythrodermic patients to find clues to the etiologic diagnosis. We performed a prospective study at the University of Sao Paulo Medical School, from 2007 to 2018, with patients with acquired erythroderma. Clinical, laboratory, histology, and molecular biology data were collected. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.2. Eczema was the most frequent etiology (20.7%), followed by psoriasis (16.8%), Sezary syndrome (12.3%), drug eruption (12.3%), atopic dermatitis (8.7%), and mycosis fungoides (5.5%). Other diagnoses (6.8%) included pemphigus foliaceous, paraneoplastic erythroderma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, dermatomyositis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, lichen planus, bullous pemphigoid, and leprosy. In 52 patients (16.8%), it was not possible to elucidate erythroderma etiology. Atopic dermatitis developed erythroderma at an earlier age (median 25 years; P = 0.0001). Acute onset was associated with drug reactions and atopic dermatitis (median time from erythroderma to diagnosis of 1 and 1.5 months, respectively; P = 0.0001). Higher immunoglobulin E levels were observed in atopic dermatitis (median 24,600 U/L; P = 0.0001). Histopathology was helpful and was consistent with the final diagnosis in 72.4%. Monoclonal T-cell proliferation in the skin was observed in mycosis fungoides (33.3%) and Sezary syndrome (90.9%). At the last assessment, 211 patients (69.3%) were alive with disease, 65 (21.7%) were alive without disease, and 27 (9.1%) died with active disease.

However, the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of key lncRNAs affecting laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs) are largely unknown. Here, we adopted a novel subpathway strategy based on the lncRNA-mRNA profiles from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and identified the lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2 (DLEU2) as an oncogene in the pathogenesis of LSCCs. We found that DLEU2 was significantly upregulated and predicted poor clinical outcomes in LSCC patients. In addition, ectopic overexpression of DLEU2 promoted the proliferation and migration of LSCC cells both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, DLEU2 served as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate PIK3CD expression by sponging miR-30c-5p and subsequently activated the Akt signaling pathway. As a target gene of DLEU2, PIK3CD was also upregulated and could predict a poor prognosis in LSCC patients. In conclusion, we found that the novel LSCC-related gene DLEU2 enhances the malignant properties of LSCCs via the miR-30c-5p/PIK3CD/Akt axis. DLEU2 and its targeted miR-30c-5p/PIK3CD/Akt axis may represent valuable prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LSCCs.",,"['Li, Xiaoming', 'Xu, Fenglei', 'Meng, Qiu', 'Gong, Ningyue', 'Teng, Zhenxiao', 'Xu, Runtong', 'Zhao, Miaoqing', 'Xia, Ming']","['Li X', 'Xu F', 'Meng Q', 'Gong N', 'Teng Z', 'Xu R', 'Zhao M', 'Xia M']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China. zhaomqsd@163.com.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324 Jingwuweiqi Road, 250021, Jinan, Shandong Province, China. xiamingsdu@sohu.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200618,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC7303144,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2581-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2581-2 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jun 18;11(6):472. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2581-2.,,6,,20210318,"['0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN30b microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall survival remains poor despite advances of anti-MM therapy. The disease biology as well as molecular mechanisms that distinguish pPCL from non-pPCL MM remain poorly understood and, given the rarity of the disease, are challenging to study. In an attempt to identify key biological mechanisms that result in the aggressive pPCL phenotype, we performed whole-exome sequencing and gene expression analysis in 23 and 41 patients with newly diagnosed pPCL, respectively. The results reveal an enrichment of complex structural changes and high-risk mutational patterns in pPCL that explain, at least in part, the aggressive nature of the disease. In particular, pPCL patients with traditional low-risk features such as translocation t(11;14) or hyperdiploidy accumulated adverse risk genetic events that could account for the poor outcome in this group. Furthermore, gene expression profiling showed upregulation of adverse risk modifiers in pPCL compared to non-pPCL MM, while adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins became increasingly downregulated.

Most common are non-obese diabetic (NOD) severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and their derivatives such as NOD SCID interleukin-2 gamma-/- (NSG), which are attractive hosts for patient-derived xenografts. Despite their widespread use, the relative biological performance of mAb in these strains has not been extensively studied. METHODS: Clinically relevant mAb of various isotypes were administered to tumor and non-tumor-bearing SCID and NOD SCID mice and the mAb clearance monitored by ELISA. Expression analysis of surface proteins in both strains was carried out by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Further analysis was performed in vitro by surface plasmon resonance to assess mAb affinity for Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) at pH 6 and pH 7.4. NOD SCID mice genetically deficient in different FcgammaR were used to delineate their involvement. RESULTS: Here, we show that strains on the NOD SCID background have significantly faster antibody clearance than other strains leading to reduced antitumor efficacy of clinically relevant mAb. This rapid clearance is dependent on antibody isotype, the presence of Fc glycosylation (at N297) and expression of FcgammaRII. Comparable effects were not seen in the parental NOD or SCID strains, demonstrating the presence of a compound defect requiring both genotypes. The absence of endogenous IgG was the key parameter transferred from the SCID as reconstituting NOD SCID or NSG mice with exogenous IgG overcame the rapid clearance and recovered antitumor efficacy. In contrast, the NOD strain was associated with reduced expression of the neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn). We propose a novel mechanism for the rapid clearance of certain mAb isotypes in NOD SCID mouse strains, based on their interaction with FcgammaRII in the context of reduced FcRn. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of understanding the limitation of the mouse strain being used for preclinical evaluation, and demonstrates that NOD SCID strains of mice should be reconstituted with IgG prior to studies of mAb efficacy.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Cox regression models were used to compare transplant-outcomes after TBI and non-TBI regimens in 624 children transplanted between 2008 and 2016. Thirty two percent (n=199) received TBI regimens whereas 68% (n=425) received non-TBI regimens. Five-year non-relapse mortality was higher with TBI regimens (22% vs. 11%, p<0.0001) but relapse was lower (23% vs. 37%, p<0.0001) compared to non-TBI regimens. Consequently, overall (62% vs. 60%, p=1.00) and leukemia-free survival (55% vs. 52%, p=0.42) did not differ between treatment groups. Grade II-IV acute GVHD was higher with TBI regimens (56% vs. 27%, p<0.0001) but not chronic GVHD. The 3-year incidence of gonadal or growth hormone deficiency was higher with TBI regimens (24% vs. 8%, p<0.001) but there were no differences in late pulmonary, cardiac or renal impairment. In the absence of a survival advantage, the choice of TBI or non-TBI regimen merits careful consideration with the data favoring non-TBI regimens to limit the burden of morbidity associated with endocrine dysfunction.",,"['Dandoy, Christopher E', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Woo Ahn, Kwang', 'He, Yizeng', 'Kolb, Anders E', 'Levine, John', 'Bo-Subait, Stephanie', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Bhatt, Neel', 'Chewning, Joseph', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz', 'Gloude, Nicholas', 'Hayashi, Robert', 'Lalefar, Nahal R', 'Law, Jason', 'MacMillan, Margaret', ""O'Brien, Tracy"", 'Prestidge, Timothy', 'Sharma, Akshay', 'Shaw, Peter', 'Winestone, Lena', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Dandoy CE', 'Davies SM', 'Woo Ahn K', 'He Y', 'Kolb AE', 'Levine J', 'Bo-Subait S', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Bhatt N', 'Chewning J', 'Gadalla S', 'Gloude N', 'Hayashi R', 'Lalefar NR', 'Law J', 'MacMillan M', ""O'Brien T"", 'Prestidge T', 'Sharma A', 'Shaw P', 'Winestone L', 'Eapen M']","['Cincinnati Children Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Cincinnati Children Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Biostatics, Institute for Heath and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.', 'Division of Biostatics, Institute for Heath and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, USA.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Children Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, USA.', 'Department of Data Abstraction, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NIH-NCI Clinical Genetics Branch, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rady Children Hospital San Diego, San Diego, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children Hospital and Research Center Oakland, CA, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Blood and Cancer Centre, Starship Children Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'St. Jude Children Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'The Children Hospital at Westmead; Westmead, Australia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Children Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20210701,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC8252927,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.249458 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.249458 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Jul 1;106(7):1839-1845. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.249458.,"['U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",7,,20210729,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Busulfan', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their clinical application is limited by severe side effects, especially dose-dependent irreversible cardiotoxicity. Other detrimental side effects of anthracyclines include therapy-related malignancies and infertility. It is unclear whether these side effects are coupled to the chemotherapeutic efficacy. Doxo, Daun, Epi, and Ida execute two cellular activities: DNA damage, causing double-strand breaks (DSBs) following poisoning of topoisomerase II (Topo II), and chromatin damage, mediated through histone eviction at selected sites in the genome. Here we report that anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity requires the combination of both cellular activities. Topo II poisons with either one of the activities fail to induce cardiotoxicity in mice and human cardiac microtissues, as observed for aclarubicin (Acla) and etoposide (Etop). Further, we show that Doxo can be detoxified by chemically separating these two activities. Anthracycline variants that induce chromatin damage without causing DSBs maintain similar anticancer potency in cell lines, mice, and human acute myeloid leukemia patients, implying that chromatin damage constitutes a major cytotoxic mechanism of anthracyclines. With these anthracyclines abstained from cardiotoxicity and therapy-related tumors, we thus uncoupled the side effects from anticancer efficacy. These results suggest that anthracycline variants acting primarily via chromatin damage may allow prolonged treatment of cancer patients and will improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.",['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

METHODS: New cancer cases diagnosed in Golestan 2004-2016 were obtained from the Golestan population-based cancer registry (GPCR) database, and age-standardized rates by cancer site, year and sex calculated per 100,000 person-years. Using IARC's DepPred package we fitted time-linear age-period models to the available GPCR data to predict the cancer incidence burden in the year 2025. We calculated the contribution of demographic changes versus changes in risk to the overall changes in incidence from 2016 to 2025. RESULTS: The number of new cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) in 2025 is predicted to increase by 61.3% from 2678 cases in 2016 to 4319 cases. While a 17.6% reduction in the number of esophageal cancer cases is predicted by 2025, the number of new cases for each of the remaining major cancers is predicted to increase over the next decade, including cancers of the stomach (a 36.1% increase from 2016 to 2025), colorectum (56.2%), lung (67.8%), female breast (93.2%), prostate (101.8%) and leukemia (96.1%). The changes in the population structure and risk contributed 37.8% and 23.5% respectively, to the overall increase in incidence. CONCLUSION: Other than for the major upper gastrointestinal cancer types, the incidence rates of common cancers observed in the province are on the rise, reinforcing the need for continuous surveillance, as well as the design and implementation of effective cancer control programs.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

In this study, we have fabricated topographical features using a class of cell culture substrates called binary colloidal crystals (BCCs), that are made by self-assembly of mixtures of spherical micron sized silica (Si) and nanometer sized polystyrene (PS) or poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles. The substrates formed are arrays of ordered, hexagonally packed large Si particles inter-dispersed with the PS particles that are stabilized by gentle heating, which melts the PS or PMMA forming substrates suitable for cell culture. BCC substrates were used for culture of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Compared to tissue culture plates, COM1 (Si5-PMMA0.4), COM2 (Si5-PS0.4) and COM4 (Si2-PSC0.22) have shown to provide a better support for mESC proliferation in the presence of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The behavior of mESCs with the BCCs in presence and absence of LIF, was further explored and it was found that interaction of mESCs with the culture substrate can be controlled by tuning surface topography and roughness, which is determined by the size and type of particles used in making BCCs. Furthermore, it was shown that limiting cell-surface interactions and controlling colony shape can promote stemness maintenance on COM1 and COM2 substrates as indicated by better proliferation and higher expression of pluripotency genes including Nanog both in presence and in absence of LIF. Together with higher expression of GATA6 gene, it can be stated that these surfaces can be used for endodermic priming of mESCs. Therefore, we believe that these surfaces, especially COM1 and COM2 surfaces can be beneficial as stem cell culture systems for further use in biomedical research.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we aimed to investigate whether c-Myc inhibition could reinforce the anti-leukemic effect of ATO, while reducing its concentration in APL cells. METHODS: NB4 cells were treated with the relevant concentrations of 10058-F4 (c-Myc inhibitor) and ATO, and then the survival of the cells was evaluated using trypan blue, MTT and BrdU assays. Moreover, the mechanism of action of the agents were evaluated using Flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. RESULTS: We found that the inhibition of c-Myc using 10058-F4 could enhance the anti-leukemic effect of ATO in APL cells through reducing the phosphorylation of IkappaB, decreasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes and in turn, inducing a caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the combination of 10058-F4 and ATO abrogated the activation of the PI3K pathway, while neither agent had significant suppressive impact on this pathway; suggesting for the first time that probably the companionship of c-Myc inhibitor may be an appealing strategy for shifting the resistance condition toward a chemo-sensitive phenotype, without the necessity to elevate the effective dose of ATO. CONCLUSION: Given the efficacy of 10058-F4 in adjuvanting approaches, we suggest this small molecule inhibitor as an impressing agent to be used alongside ATO in the treatment of APL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 IMSS.

Traditional chemotherapy can achieve complete remission in most patients, but so far, only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only way to cure AML. Recurrence, drug resistance, and transplant-related deaths remain a key issue for AML treatment. Therefore, finding new treatments to improve the prognosis of patients with AML is urgently needed. In recent years, the emergence of new immunotherapy has revolutionized the concept of cancer treatment in the past few decades.

METHODS: Pathogenic data of 504 hospitalized patients with agranulocytosis caused by nosocomial infection in the Department of Hematology, the First Hospital of Lanzhou University from May 2015 to May 2018 were collected and retrospectively analyzed for the distribution of pathogenic bacteria and the results of drug susceptibility. RESULTS: The isolated pathogenic bacteria strains amounted to 184, out of which, 168 strains (91.3%) orginated from the patients with acute leukemia, while 16 strains (8.7%) originated from the patients with non-acute leukemia. The positive samples mainly originated from blood stream, the isolated bacteria from which were 81 straims (44%); then originated from sputam and pharynx swabs, from which isolated bacteria amounted to 54 strains (29.3%) and 35 strains (19%) respectively. In the pathogenic bacteria, the Gram-negative bacteria amounted to 126 strains accounting for 68.46%, out of which the most commond bacteria strains were Klebseilla pneumoniae, cscherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the Gram positive bocteria amounted to 23 strains accounting for 12.5%, mainly staphy lococeus anreus, and Staphylococcus epitermidis; the fungi amounted to 35 strains accounting for 19.02%, mainly Candida albicans. The detection rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 40.0% and 22.2%, respectively. They were 100% sensitive to amikacin and 27.8% resistant to carbapenems. Klebsiella pneumoniae had the highest sensitivity to amikacin, 94.44% to ampicillin, 97.22% to carbapenems and 100% sensitive to ammonia. Their penicillin-resistance rate was the highest, up to 80%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to the antibiotics (80%. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were detected in Gram-positive bacteria. The susceptibility rate of main Gram-positive bacteria to vancomycin and linezolid was 100%, and they were 100% resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria are the main pathogens of nosocomial infection in patients with hematological agranulocytosis. Pathogens have different resistance to antimicrobial agents.

METHODS: APL cell line HL-60 was transfected by miR-218 and RNA-negative control sequences, respectively. The expression of miR-218 in cells was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The effect of transfected miR-218 on the proliferation of APL cells was detected by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The regulation effect of miR-218 on Bmi-1 expression was determined by Western blot. The correlation of miR-218 expressions with Bmi-1 was analyzed by Spearman test.

METHODS: Eight-four patients with CLL treated in People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from June 2013 to June 2018 were selected. and 20 healthy people were selected as control group. RNA was extracted from CD19+B lymphocytes of peripheral blood by magnetic bead sorting, the expression level of miR-181b was detected, and it's expression differences in different IPI groups were analyzed. The correlation between the expression level of miR-181b and PFS of CLL patients also was analyzed. miR-181b target genes were predicted by online database and literatures, and gene annotation analysis and relevant signal pathway analysis were performed for candidate target genes. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-181b in CLL patients was significantly lower than that in control group (P0.01); The expression level of miR-181b in the low-risk group was higher than that in high-risk group and extremely high-risk group (P0.05), but there was no statistical difference between low-risk group and medium-risk group (P=1.00). The expression level of miR-181b in medium-risk group was higher than that in high-risk group and extremely high-risk group (P0.05), but there was no difference between high-risk group and extremely high-risk group (P=1.00). ROC curve results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.792 (P0.01).When the expression level of miR-181b was at the threshold value of 0.279, it showed a better sensitivity (62.9%) and specificity (91.8%). Survival analysis results suggested that compared with the high expression group, the miR-181b low expression group had poor PFS (log rank: P=0.047). Prediction of miR-181b by using the starBase, targetscan and picTar database and its combination with literature reports indicated that CARD11, ZFP36L1, RUNX1, NR4A3, ATP1B1, PUM1 and PLAG1 related with blood diseases, and up-regulated CARD11 and ZFP36L1 participated in lymphoid tumor formation by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell aging. CONCLUSION: The expression level of miR-181b in CLL group are significantly lower than that in the controls group, and the low expression of miR-181b relates with poor prognosis of CLL patients.

When ABCA2 was over-expressed, the K562-R cell growth was promoted and autophagy and apoptosis were inhibited (P0.01). The miR-124-3p promoted cell autophagy and apoptosis but inhibited cell growth in nude mice transplant tumor model (P0.01). CONCLUSION: miR-124-3p can target ABCA2 to inhibit the growth of CML cells and promote the cell autophagy and apoptosis of CML cells.",,"['Zhang, Feng-Juan', 'Cao, Wei-Jie', 'Chang, Fang-Fang', 'Huang, Fu-Yun', 'Guo, Jian-Xin']","['Zhang FJ', 'Cao WJ', 'Chang FF', 'Huang FY', 'Guo JX']","['Department of Internal Medicine Teaching and Research Section of Henan Medical College, Zhengzhou 451191, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine Teaching and Research Section of Henan Medical College, Zhengzhou 451191, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine Teaching and Research Section of Henan Medical College, Zhengzhou 451191, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine Teaching and Research Section of Henan Medical College, Zhengzhou 451191, Henan Province, China,E-mail: guojianxin888@126.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2020)02-0789-08 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun;28(3):789-796. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.03.012.,,3,,20200818,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abca2 protein, mouse)', '0 (MIRN124 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: DNA was extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of newly diagnosed CBF-AML patients admitted to the Hematology Department of the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from January 2015 to January 2019. Next-generation sequencing was used for detection of 34 kinds of hematologic malignancy-related gene mutations in patients with CBF-AML, the effect of related gene mutations on the first complete remission (CR1) rate in one course of induction chemotherapy was analyzed by combineation with clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 34 kinds of genes in bone marrow or peripheral blood of 43 patients were detected by high throughput sequencing and the gene mutations were detected in 16 out of 34 genes. The mutation rate of KIT gene was the highest (48.8%), followed by NRAS (16.3%), ASXL1 (16.3%), TET2 (11.6%), CSF3R (9.3%), FLT3 (9.3%), KRAS (7.0%). The detection rates of mutations in different functional genes were as follows: genes related with signal transduction pathway (KIT, FLT3, CSF3R, KRAS, NRAS, JAK2, CALR, SH2B3, CBL) had the highest mutation frequency (72.1% (31/43); epigenetic modification gene mutation frequency was 30.2% (13/43), including ASXL1, TET2, BCOR); transcriptional regulation gene mutation frequency was 7.0% (3/43), including ETV6, RUNX1, GATA2). Splicing factor related gene mutation frequency was 2.3% (1/43), including ZRSR2). The CR1 rate was 74.4% after one course of induction chemotherapy. At first diagnosis, patients with low expression of WT1 (the median value of WT1 was 788.9) were more likely to get CR1 (P=0.032) and the RFS of patients who got CR1 after one course of induction chemotherapy was significantly longer than that of patients without CR1 [7.6 (2.2-44.1) versus 5.8 (1-19.4), (P=0.048)]. The rate of CR1 in the signal transduction pathway gene mutation group was significantly lower than that in non-mutation group (64.5% vs 100%) (P=0.045), while the level of serum hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) was significantly higher than that in non-mutation group [(418 (154-2702) vs 246 (110-1068)] (P=0.032). There was no difference in CD56 expression between the two groups (P=0.053), which was limited to the difference between (>/=20%) expression and non-expression. (P=0.048).

The clinical features, immunophenotypic characteristics, cytogenetic characteristics, molecular biological characteristics and gene mutation characteristics were recorded, the survival and prognostic influencing factors of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 184 patients, 94 cases were male, 90 cases were female, median age were 36.0 years, median WBC count were 22.0x10(9)/L, 156 cases as 84.78% for FAB typing M5, and 18 cases as 28.13% for MLL/AF9 gene positive. The median total survival time and recurrence-free survival time of 184 patients were 15.7 months and 13.3 months respectively. The cumulative total survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate by followed-up for 2 years were 36.72% and 29.33% respectively. The cumulative overall survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate of transplant recipients were significantly higher than those of non-transplant recipients by follow-up for 2 years (P0.05). Univariate analysis showed that age, baseline WBC count, baseline Hb levels, complete remission after one course of treatment and transplantation or no were the influencing factors of overall survival time in adult AML patients with MLL rearrangement (P0.05).

METHOD: The clinical data of 133 children with ALL treated with CCCG-ALL-2015 from June 2016 to June 2019 (chemotherapy stage, risk level, MRD), infection during hospitalization (course of infection, laboratory indicators, sites of infection, outcome) and nutritional status (sex, age, height/ length, weight) were enrolled. The Chi 2 test and Logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The rate of nosocomial infection was 19.9% in 133 children with ALL, in which 3 were infection-related death. Sex, immunophenotype and risk showed no significantly affect on the occurrence of nosocomial infection (P0.05), but neutrophil count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, chemotherapy stage, length of stay in hospital and nutritional status showed affect on the occurrence of nosocomial infection (P0.05). Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that chemotherapy stage, length of hospital stay, neutrophils and nutritional status were the independent risk factors, in which the respiratory tract infection was the most common. Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi accounted for 44.1%, 52.9% and 2.9% respectively. The negative rate of MRD in day 19 and day 46 between different nutritional status groups showed statistically significant (P0.05). CONCLUSION: Neutrophil count, chemotherapy stage, length of stay in hospital and nutritional status are independent risk factors for nosocomial infection. Among of them, nutritional status negatively correlated with nosocomial infection, and the poorer nutritional status, the higher risk of nosocomial infection.

METHODS: After two sequences of Bmi-1-siRNA were transfected into drug-resistant K562/ADR cells, the mRNA and protein expressions of Bmi-1 gene were detected. After Bmi-1 gene silencing the expression of P-gp and MDR1 were detected and the accumulation of doxorubicin in K562/ADR cells were detected by flow cytometry to determine the effect of Bmi-1 gene silencing on drug resistance of K562/ADR cells. The protein expression of NF-kappaB was analyzed after Bmi-1 gene silencing. Then after K562/ADR cells were treated with NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC, the protein expression of P-gp and its functional changes were analyzed to determine the effect of NF-kappaB on drug resistance of leukemia cells. The protein expressions of PTEN, AKT and p-AKT after Bmi-1 gene silencing were detected and the effect of Bmi-1 gene silencing on PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in drug-resistant cells was determined. After K562/ADR cells were treated with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002, the protein expressions of NF-kappaB and P-gp were analyzed to determine the regulation of AKT on the expression of NF-kappaB and P-gp. The protein expressions of AKT, p-AKT, NF-kappaB and P-gp were detected after the Bmi-1-siRNA transfected cells were treated by PTEN inhibitor BPV. Above-mentioned expression of mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, and the protein expression was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of Bmi-1 gene in K562/ADR cells decreased at both mRNA and protein levels and the doxorubicin accumulation increased after Bmi-1 gene silencing. The expression of MDR1/P-gp in Bmi-1-siRNA transfected cells was lower than that in K562/ADR cells (P0.05). After Bmi-1 gene silencing, the activity of NF-kappaB decreased. The activity of NF-kappaB and P-gp expression was inhibited and the function of P-gp in K562/ADR cells was reduced by using NF-kappaB inhibitor (PDTC). The protein expression of PTEN increased while the protein expression of p-AKT decreased after Bmi-1 gene silencing (P0.05).

METHODS: Twelve acute leukemia patients who were underwent allo-HSCT from April 2013 to November 2018 in Hainan Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital were selected, including 5 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 7 case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Three cases received HLA matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 8 cases received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 1 cases received partially mismatched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Pretreatment regimen: 9 cases received modified BU/CY+ATG pretreatment regimen, 3 cases received BU/CY pretreatment regimen. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention regimen: all patients received cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil combined with short-term methotrexate regimen. The clinical efficacy of allo-HSCT in treatment of acute leukemia in the tropical area was analyzed by detecting hematopoietic reconstitution, GVHD, infection, relapse and survival after transplantation. RESULTS: All the 12 patients achieved granulocyte reconstruction and megakaryocyte reconstruction. The median time of granulocyte reconstruction was 11.5 (6-14) days, and the median time of megakaryocytic reconstruction was 12.5 (10-22) days. Within 100 days after transplantation, the acute GVHD occurved in 8 cases, including 6 cases of - degree acute GVHD and 2 cases of - degree acute GVHD, 11 cases survived more than 100 days after transplantation, and the chronic GVHD occurred in 1 case, which was mildly limited. Pulmonary infection occurred in 7 cases, cytomegaloviremia occurred in 6 cases, EB viremia occurred in 6 cases, and hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in 5 cases. 2 cases relapsed and eventually died, and the remaining 10 patients survived without disease until the date of follow-up. The median follow-up time was 4 (1-68) months, 83.3% (10/12) survived without disease, and 16.7% (2/12) relapsed.

METHODS: Seven children with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of SUN Yat-Sen University were selected. 7 cases of T-ALL were divided into 2 groups: HSCT plus chidamide-treated group (4 cases) and traditional HSCT-treated group (3 cases) as control. The incidence of GVHD and other related complications, as well as implantation, recurrence and survival were compared between the two groups, and the side effects of chidamide were observed. All the patients were follow-up until January 2019. RESULTS: All the 7 patients were alive and, there was no difference in the incidence of acute GVHD between the HSCT plus chidamides treated group and the traditional HSCT-treated group. The implantation rate of HSCT was 100%, and there were no recurrence occurred. During the application of chidamide, 3 cases showed adverse reactions, of which 2 cases had adverse reactions of grade 3 or higher, and 2 cases were hematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), other adverse reactions were non-hematologic adverse reactions (transaminase elevation, fatigue, nausea, vomiting), there were no serious adverse reactions occurred. In the HSCT plus chidamide-treated group, 2 cases were found that mature lymphocytes were not expressed by tumors, during examing for minimal redidaul disease (MRD). Compared with the immunophenotype and TCR rearrangement at first diagnosis, the results did not support the source of residual T-ALL tumor cells. During the review of MRD, it was found that the abnormal T cells showed an increasing trend, indicating that chidamide might induce leukemia cell differentiation through some pathways. CONCLUSION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is still an effective method to cure children's T-ALL. In some cases, abnormal T-cell nonclonal amplification occurs during the application of chidamide, and the children with T-ALL can tolerable adverse reactions of chidamide.",,"['Zhang, Ya-Ting', 'Huang, Ke', 'Xu, Lv-Hong', 'Han, Xia-Wei', 'Li, Xin-Yu', 'Fang, Jian-Pei']","['Zhang YT', 'Huang K', 'Xu LH', 'Han XW', 'Li XY', 'Fang JP']","['Department of Pediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China,E-mail: jpfang2005@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2020)02-0737-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun;28(3):737-741. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.03.004.,,3,,20200818,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '87CIC980Y0', '(N-(2-amino-5-fluorobenzyl)-4-(N-(pyridine-3-acrylyl)aminomethyl)benzamide)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines', 'Benzamides', 'Child', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 53 cases involving translocations of chromosome 11q23 were identified by chromosome banding analysis. MLL rearrangements were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or multiplex nested PCR. The samples were screened for mutations in the candidate genes FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, TET2, N-RAS, ASXLI, EZH2, DNMT3, C-Kit, NPM1, WT1, CEBPA by using genomic DNA-PCR and deep-sequencing. RESULTS: 21/53 MLL-rearranged AML cases showed at least one additional chromosomal aberrations. The most common additional aberration was +8. Gene mutations were observed in 23 cases (43.4%) and most cases showed singal mutation. N-RAS mutation was more frequent (8 cases, 15.1%), followed by WT1 mutation in 4 cases (7.5%), FLT3-ITD mutation in 3 cases, ASXL1 mutation in 2 cases, DNMT3A mutation in 2 cases, EZH2 mutation in 1 case, c-Kit17 mutation in 1 case, FLT3-TKD mutation in 1 case, and FLT3-ITD and TKD mutation coexistent in 1 case. No mutation was detected in CEBPA, NPM1, C-KIT8, TET2. Median OS for gene mutated patients was 8.5 months and 13 months for no mutated patients. Median OS for patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was 22.5 months and 7.5 months for patients who olny received chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: A relatively high mutation frequency is observed in AML patients with 11q23/MLL rearrangements and most cases shows single mutation. The RAS signaling pathway alterations are most common. Gene mutation does not affect the OS of these patients, who show poor prognosis. A significantly higher Hb at initial diagnosis in FLT3 mutated patients is significantly higher than that in FLT3 wild-type cases.

The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown a remarkable clinical activity in patients with CML, but their efficacy in treating Ph(+) B-ALL is limited. Identifying additional therapeutic targets is important for the effective treatment of Ph(+) B-ALL. METHODS: Activation of the JNK signaling pathway in human and mouse BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL cells with or without dasatinib treatment was analyzed by Western blotting. JNK was inhibited either by RNA interference or chemical inhibitors, such as JNK-IN-8. The effect of JNK inhibition with or without BCR-ABL TKI dasatinib on BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL cells was analyzed by the CellTiter-Glo(R) Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. The in vivo effects of JNK-IN-8 and dasatinib alone or in combination were tested using a BCR-ABL induced B-ALL mouse model. RESULTS: We found that the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is abnormally activated in both human and mouse BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL cells, but the BCR-ABL TKI does not inhibit JNK activation in these cells. Inhibition of JNK, either by RNAi-mediated downregulation or by JNK inhibitors, could significantly reduce viability of Ph(+) B-ALL cells. JNK inhibition by RNAi-mediated downregulation or JNK inhibitors also showed a synergistic effect with the BCR-ABL TKI, dasatinib, in killing Ph(+) B-ALL cells in vitro. Furthermore, a potent JNK inhibitor, JNK-IN-8, in combination with dasatinib markedly improved the survival of mice with BCR-ABL induced B-ALL, as compared to the treatment with dasatinib alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that simultaneously targeting both BCR-ABL and JNK kinase might serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for Ph(+) B-ALL.",,"['Xiao, Xinhua', 'Liu, Ping', 'Li,

It remains a challenge to directly inhibit rearranged MLL itself because of its multiple fusion partners and the poorly annotated downstream genes of MLL fusion proteins; therefore, novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. METHODS: qRT-PCR, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and leukemia-free survival analysis were used to validate LAMP5-AS1 (LAMP5 antisense 1) expression and evaluate its clinical value. We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the functional relevance of LAMP5-AS1 in MLL leukemia progression and leukemia cell stemness. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), histone methyltransferase assay, RNA pull-down assay, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to validate the relationship between LAMP5-AS1 and the methyltransferase activity of DOT1L. The downstream ectopic target genes of LAMP5-AS1/DOT1L were validated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and western blot. RESULTS: We discovered that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LAMP5-AS1 can promote higher degrees of H3K79 methylation, followed by upregulated expression of the self-renewal genes in the HOXA cluster, which are responsible for leukemia stemness in context of MLL rearrangements. We found that LAMP5-AS1 is specifically overexpressed in MLL leukemia patients (n = 58) than that in the MLL-wt leukemia (n = 163) (p < 0.001), and the patients with a higher expression level of LAMP5-AS1 exhibited a reduced 5-year leukemia-free survival (p < 0.01). LAMP5-AS1 suppression significantly reduced colony formation and increased differentiation of primary MLL leukemia CD34+ cells. Mechanistically, LAMP5-AS1 facilitated the methyltransferase activity of DOT1L by directly binding its Lys-rich region of catalytic domain, thus promoting the global patterns of H3K79 dimethylation and trimethylation in cells. These observations supported that LAMP5-AS1 upregulated H3K79me2/me3 and the transcription of DOT1L ectopic target genes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that a lncRNA regulates the self-renewal program and differentiation block in MLL leukemia cells by facilitating the methyltransferase activity of DOT1L and global H3K79 methylation, showing its potential as a therapeutic target for MLL leukemia.",,"['Wang, Wen-Tao', 'Chen, Tian-Qi', 'Zeng, Zhan-Cheng', 'Pan, Qi', 'Huang, Wei', 'Han, Cai', 'Fang, Ke', 'Sun,

Genus Datura encompasses numerous species with reported medicinal uses. However, its potential as a source of natural anticancer agents is yet to be determined. Datura stramonium (DS) and Datura inoxia (DI) are the two species chosen for this study. METHODS: Total phenolic and flavonoid content (TPC and TFC) as well as antioxidant activity were assessed through colorimetric method. Polyphenolic quantification was done by RP-HPLC. Following extract standardization ethyl acetate leaf extracts of both species (DSL-EA and DIL-EA) were chosen for anticancer studies. In vitro cytotoxicity using various models including cancer cell lines was monitored. Following toxicity studies, benzene (0.2 ml) was used to induce leukemia in Sprague-Dawley rats. Extracts were orally administered to preventive (100 and 200 mg/kg) and treatment (200 mg/kg only) groups. The antileukemic potential of extracts was assessed through haematological, biochemical, endogenous antioxidants and histological parameters. RESULTS: Significant TPC and TFC were estimated in DSL-EA and DIL-EA. RP-HPLC quantified (mug/mg extract) rutin (0.89 +/- 0.03), gallic acid (0.35 +/- 0.07), catechin (0.24 +/- 0.02) and apigenin (0.29 +/- 0.09) in DSL-EA while rutin (0.036 +/- 0.004) and caffeic acid (0.27 +/- 0.03) in DIL-EA. Both extracts exhibited significant brine shrimp cytotoxicity (LC50 < 12.5 mug/ml). DIL-EA exhibited greater cytotoxicity against PC-3, MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 cell lines (IC50 < 3 mug/ml in each case) as well as higher protein kinase inhibitory action (MIC: 25 mug/disc) compared to DSL-EA. Leukemia induced in rats was affirmed by elevated serum levels of WBCs (7.78 +/- 0.012 (x 10(3)) /mul), bilirubin (7.56 +/- 0.97 mg/dl), Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) (133.75 +/- 2.61 nM/min/mg protein), decreased RBCs (4.33 +/- 0.065 (x 10(6))/mul), platelets (344 +/- 3.19 (x 10(3))/mul), total proteins (2.14 +/- 0.11 g/dl), Glutathione S-transferases (GST) (81.01 +/- 0.44 nM/min/ml), endogenous antioxidant enzymes levels and abnormal liver and kidney functionality in disease control rats. Both species revealed almost identical and significant (p < 0.05) alleviative effects in benzene induced leukemia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 299 patients, age 1-31 years. High-risk (HR) patients had >/= 1% minimal detectable disease (MDD) in the bone marrow at diagnosis or received prior steroid treatment. Induction failure was defined as failure to achieve a partial response (PR) by the end of the 4-week induction. All patients received the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (ABFM) C-MTX regimen. HR patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive 6 5-day courses of nelarabine incorporated into ABFM. Patients with induction failure were nonrandomly assigned to ABFM C-MTX plus nelarabine. No patients received prophylactic cranial radiation; however, patients with CNS3 disease (CSF WBC >/= 5/muL with blasts or cranial nerve palsies, brain/eye involvement, or hypothalamic syndrome) were ineligible. RESULTS: At end-induction, 98.8% of evaluable participants had at least a PR. The 4-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 84.7% +/- 2.3% and 89.0% +/- 2.0%. The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) from end-induction was 85.9% +/- 2.6%. There was no difference in DFS observed between the HR and standard-risk groups (P = .29) or by treatment regimen (P = .55). Disease stage, tumor response, and MDD at diagnosis did not demonstrate thresholds that resulted in differences in EFS. Nelarabine did not show an advantage for HR patients. CNS relapse occurred in only 4 patients. CONCLUSION: COG AALL0434 produced excellent outcomes in one of the largest trials ever conducted for patients with newly diagnosed T-LL. The COG ABFM regimen with C-MTX provided excellent EFS and OS without cranial radiation.",,"['Hayashi, Robert J', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Chen, Zhiguo', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Hermiston, Michelle L', 'Teachey, David T', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Lim, Megan S', 'Gross, Thomas G', 'Bollard, Catherine M']","['Hayashi RJ', 'Winter SS', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Devidas M', 'Chen Z', 'Wood BL', 'Hermiston ML', 'Teachey DT', 'Perkins SL', 'Miles RR', 'Raetz EA', 'Loh ML', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Lim MS', 'Gross TG', 'Bollard CM']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Washington School of Medicine, St Louis Children's Hospital, St Louis, MO."", ""Children's Minnesota Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Minneapolis, MN."", 'Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, VA.', ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Medicine and College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Laboratory Medicine, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital and the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Health, New York, NY.', ""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital and the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern/Simmons Cancer Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Health, New York, NY.', ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'National Cancer Institute Center for Global Health, Rockville, MD.', ""Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's National Health System, Washington, DC.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200617,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC7479761,,,,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.00531 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Sep 10;38(26):3062-3070. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.00531.

The SEDDS developed contained a hydrophobic ion pair between benzathine (BZT) and ATRA and was enriched with tocotrienols by the input of a palm oil tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) in its composition. Results: SEDDS-TRF-ATRA-BZT allowed the formation of emulsions with nanometric size that retained ATRA within their core after dispersion. Pharmacokinetic parameters after oral administration of SEDDS-TRF-ATRA-BZT in mice were improved compared with what was seen for an ATRA solution.

Patient-/parent-reported lack of health care provider recommendation for HPV vaccination is strongly associated with vaccine noninitiation. We aimed to identify patient-level factors associated with survivor-/parent-reported lack of provider recommendation for HPV vaccination among young cancer survivors. METHODS: Cancer survivors ages 9-26 years and 1-5 years off therapy completed a cross-sectional survey (parent-completed for survivors 9-17 years of age). Lack of health care provider HPV vaccine recommendation was the outcome of interest in a multivariable logistic regression model that included relevant patient-level sociodemographic, clinical, and vaccine-related variables. RESULTS: Of 955 survivors, 54% were male, 66% were non-Hispanic White, and 36% had leukemia. At survey participation, survivors were an average age (+/- standard deviation) of 16.3 +/- 4.7 years and 32.8 +/- 14.7 months off therapy. Lack of provider HPV vaccine recommendation was reported by 73% (95% CI, 70% to 75%) of survivors. For the entire cohort, patient-level factors associated with lack of reported provider recommendation included perceived lack of insurance coverage for the HPV vaccine (odds ratio [OR], 4.0; 95% CI, 2.7 to 5.9; P < .001), male sex (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.0; P < .001), and decreased parent-survivor communication regarding HPV vaccination (OR, 1.7 per unit decrease in score; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.2; P < .001). In the sex- and age-stratified models, perceived lack of insurance coverage (all models) and male sex (age-stratified models) were also significantly associated with lack of reported provider recommendation. CONCLUSION: We identified factors characterizing survivors at risk for not reporting receipt of a health care provider HPV vaccine recommendation. Future research is needed to develop interventions that facilitate effective provider recommendations for HPV vaccination among all young cancer survivors.",,"['York, Jocelyn M', 'Klosky, James L', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Connelly, James A', 'Wasilewski-Masker, Karen', 'Giuliano, Anna R', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Wong, F Lennie', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Landier, Wendy']","['York JM', 'Klosky JL', 'Chen Y', 'Connelly JA', 'Wasilewski-Masker K', 'Giuliano AR', 'Robison LL', 'Wong FL', 'Hudson MM', 'Bhatia S', 'Landier W']","['University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', ""Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA."", 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', ""Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA."", 'Center for Immunization and Infection Research in Cancer, H.

As a result, the landscape of standard acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy has remarkably changed; only within the last few years, eight new agents were approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with AML. AREAS COVERED: Although the addition of a new arsenal of AML drugs provides more options for patients, therapy decisions have become more challenging than it used to be. In the first section of this review, we summarized the clinical development of conventional combination regimens in AML, and in the second part, we focused on the development of novel and conventional chemotherapy combinations. Acute promyelocytic leukemia will not be discussed in this review. EXPERT OPINION: The recurrent genomic aberrancies are not solely of prognostic relevance but can help with therapeutic decision-making at both diagnosis and relapse. Many challenges still remain to further improve on the survival of patients with AML, particularly for those with complex karyotype, secondary AML, or TP53 mutations.

AREA COVERED: A literature search was undertaken on clinical trials and real-world experience data on patients with TP53 dysfunction treated with different protocols. Moreover, data on the TP53 biological function and on the tests currently employed for its assessment were reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Although TP53 dysfunction has less negative influence on the new biological therapies, patients with these alterations, particularly those with biallelic inactivation of TP53, have a worst outcome with these therapies than those without alterations. At present, a determination of TP53, particularly with next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, may be sufficient for the identifications of the patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy, although integration with del(17p) would be advisable.

Based on our results confirming similarity of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) to another gammaherpesvirus, human oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we were able to interpret some processes observed in the course of MHV-68 infection in analogy to EBV infection. In particular, that were the processes occurring during MHV-68-induced persistent infection in mice accompanied by tumor formation and leukemia following immunosuppression. Since EBV is a highly species specific virus, infecting humans only, these processes cannot be experimentally examined at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels in natural host. However, they can be investigated in BALB/c mice infected with MHV-68, which is nowadays generally accepted model mainly thanks to experimental results achieved by our research team. The important mouse model MHV-68 is a prototype strain of MuHV-4 species and is classified as a member of the order Herpesvirales, family Herpesviridae, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and genus Rhadinovirus. During 40 years since its isolation from wild rodents, the virus was distributed into many virological laboratories in Europe (such as England, Slovakia, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, Russia, Sweden), USA, Canada, China, Korea, Japan and Australia. Global research of this virus, which has become an irreplaceable animal model, has expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis and immunology of human and animal gammaherpesvirus infections as well as the gammaherpesvirus-associated oncogenesis. No less important fact is that MHV-68 provides an excellent model to explore methods for controlling gammaherpesvirus infections through vaccination and chemotherapy.

Genome mining indicated that members of the underexplored genus Pseudosporangium, from which no secondary metabolites have been reported to date, may harbor the biosynthetic machinery for the formation of novel natural products. The strain RD062863, that is available at a public culture collection, was obtained and subjected to metabolite analysis, which resulted in the discovery of a novel cyclopeptide, pseudosporamide (1), along with three new oligomycin-class polyketides, pseudosporamicins A-C (2-4). The unusual structure of compound 1, featured by a biaryl-bond bridging across a tripeptide scaffold, N-acetyl-L-Tyr-L-Pro-L-Trp, was determined by a combination of spectroscopic analyses, chemical derivatization, ECD calculation, and DFT-based theoretical chemical shift calculation, revealing the presence of an (S a)-axial chirality around the biaryl bond. Compounds 2-4 lacked hydroxylation on the side chain of the spiroacetal rings, which showed clear contrast to other oligomycin congeners and related polyketides with ring-truncation or expansion. The new macrolides 2-4 displayed potent antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Kocuria rhizohpila and the plant pathogenic fungus Glomerella cingulata. All compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity against P388 murine leukemia cells with IC50 values in the micromolar to submicromolar ranges. These results exemplified the validity of phylogeny-focused strain selection combined with biosynthetic gene-directed genome mining for the efficient discovery of new natural products.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Saito et al.; licensee Beilstein-Institut.']","['Saito, Shun', 'Atsumi, Kota', 'Zhou, Tao', 'Fukaya, Keisuke', 'Urabe, Daisuke', 'Oku, Naoya', 'Karim, Md Rokon Ul', 'Komaki, Hisayuki', 'Igarashi, Yasuhiro']","['Saito S', 'Atsumi K', 'Zhou T', 'Fukaya K', 'Urabe D', 'Oku N', 'Karim MRU', 'Komaki H', 'Igarashi Y']","['Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.', 'Biological Resource Center, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NBRC), Kisarazu, Chiba 292-0818, Japan.', 'Biotechnology Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200525,Germany,Beilstein J Org Chem,Beilstein journal of organic chemistry,101250746,PMC7277628,['NOTNLM'],"['DFT-based calculation', 'Pseudosporangium', 'oligomycin', 'peptide', 'polyketides', 'rare actinomycetes']",,2020/06/20 06:00,2020/06/20 06:01,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3762/bjoc.16.97 [doi]'],epublish,Beilstein J Org Chem. 2020 May 25;16:1100-1110. doi: 10.3762/bjoc.16.97. eCollection 2020.,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8628-5614', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7148-4714', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1999-9374', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5114-1389']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of cytogenetic aberrations and a small number of molecular abnormalities are still the most important risk and therapy stratification methods in clinical practice today. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides a large amount of data contributing to elucidation of mutational landscape of childhood (cALL) and adult ALL (aALL). Methods: We analyzed DNA samples from 34 cALL and aALL patients, using NGS targeted sequencing TruSeq Amplicon - Cancer Panel (TSACP) which targets mutational hotspots in 48 cancer related genes. Results: We identified a total of 330 variants in the coding regions, out of which only 95 were potentially protein-changing. Observed in individual patients, detected mutations predominantly disrupted Ras/RTK pathway (STK11, KIT, MET, NRAS, KRAS, PTEN). Additionally, we identified 5 patients with the same mutation in HNF1A gene, disrupting both Wnt and Notch signaling pathway. In two patients we detected variants in NOTCH1 gene. HNF1A and NOTCH1 variants were mutually exclusive, while genes involved in Ras/RTK pathway exhibit a tendency of mutation accumulation. Conclusions: Our results showed that ALL contains low number of mutations, without significant differences between cALL and aALL (median per patient 2 and 3, respectively). Detected mutations affect few key signaling pathways, primarily Ras/RTK cascade. This study contributes to knowledge of ALL mutational landscape, leading to better understanding of molecular basis of this disease.","['2020 Dragana Janic, Jelena Peric, Teodora Karan-Djurasevic, Tatjana Kostic, Irena', 'Marjanovic, Bojana Stanic, Nadja Pejanovic, Lidija Dokmanovic, Jelena Lazic, Nada', 'Krstovski, Marijana Virijevic, Dragica Tomin, Ana Vidovic, Nada', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic, Sonja Pavlovic, Natasa Tosic, published by CEON/CEES.']","['Janic, Dragana', 'Peric, Jelena', 'Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora', 'Kostic, Tatjana', 'Marjanovic, Irena', 'Stanic, Bojana', 'Pejanovic, Nadja', 'Dokmanovic, Lidija', 'Lazic, Jelena', 'Krstovski, Nada', 'Virijevic, Marijana', 'Tomin, Dragica', 'Vidovic, Ana', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic, Nada', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Tosic, Natasa']","['Janic D', 'Peric J', 'Karan-Djurasevic T', 'Kostic T', 'Marjanovic I', 'Stanic B', 'Pejanovic N', 'Dokmanovic L', 'Lazic J', 'Krstovski N', 'Virijevic M', 'Tomin D', 'Vidovic A', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic N', 'Pavlovic S', 'Tosic N']","[""University of Belgrade, University Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade."", 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', ""University of Belgrade, University Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade."", ""University of Belgrade, University Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade."", ""University of Belgrade, University Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade."", 'Clinical Center of Serbia, Clinic of Hematology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade.', 'Clinical Center of Serbia, Clinic of Hematology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade.', 'Clinical Center of Serbia, Clinic of Hematology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade.', 'Clinical Center of Serbia, Clinic of Hematology, Belgrade + University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.', 'University of Belgrade, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Belgrade.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Serbia,J Med Biochem,Journal of medical biochemistry,101315490,PMC7290126,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'next generation sequencing', 'somatic mutations']","['Conflict of Interest: The authors stated that they have no conflicts of interest', 'regarding the publication of this article.']",2020/06/20 06:00,2020/06/20 06:01,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2478/jomb-2019-0017 [doi]', 'jomb-39-1-2001072J [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Biochem. 2020 Jan 10;39(1):72-82. doi: 10.2478/jomb-2019-0017.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four of 18 patients (22.2%) had B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, that midfoot arthritis was their first manifestation. Also, their laboratory findings confirmed that platelet, lactic acid dehydrogenesis, and uric acid values were significantly higher in these children. Based on statistical evaluation, there was no significant difference between age and sex in these patients. Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that ""midfoot arthritis"" may be the first manifestation of leukemia in children even with a near-normal hematologic values.",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],"['Shiari, Reza', 'Salar, Nargess', 'Parvneh, Vadood Javadi', 'Rahmani, Khosro', 'Yeganeh, Mehrnoush Hassas', 'Shiari, Sara']","['Shiari R', 'Salar N', 'Parvneh VJ', 'Rahmani K', 'Yeganeh MH', 'Shiari S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200608,United States,Clin Med Insights Arthritis Musculoskelet Disord,Clinical medicine insights.

Mutations related to daptomycin-nonsusceptible phenotype in liaSR genes were found in all strains of the study, including those with a minimum inhibitory concentration <1 microg/mL collected before daptomycin therapy. Epidemiological investigation using core genome single nucleotide polymorphism and core genome multilocus sequence typing revealed clonality of all the isolates. In this study, we conclude that real-time genome sequencing of clinical isolates can provide rapid access to timely information on daptomycin-resistant genotypes that would help clinicians speed up and optimize the selection of the antibiotic for treatment.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The conversion generally leads to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but more aggressive forms such as Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) can also occur. RT is a rare complication of CLL. RT can be confused with CLL progression. Its identification is crucial because the management of lymphoma and CLL differ from each other. Furthermore, the use of certain agents for CLL such as venetoclax increases the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in neoplasms with rapid replication such as DLBCL or CLL with hyperleukocytosis (blast crisis). We present the case of a 76-year-old man with a history of CLL on chemotherapy who developed fatigue, malaise, night sweats, chills, and unintentional weight loss for which he was started on treatment with venetoclax due to suspected clinical progression of his disease. The patient developed TLS, requiring hospitalization, and he was found to have an acute blast crisis. Also, his CLL was found to have been transformed into an aggressive DLBCL. This case highlights the importance of differentiating a true progression of CLL from RT into an aggressive lymphoma given that treatment would be different for the two and the prognosis with the transformation is worse.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Chango Azanza et al.']","['Chango Azanza, Juan Jose', 'Calle Sarmiento, Paola Michelle', 'Mathew Thomas, Vinay', 'Lopetegui Lia, Nerea', 'Kidwai, Neiha']","['Chango Azanza JJ', 'Calle Sarmiento PM', 'Mathew Thomas V', 'Lopetegui Lia N', 'Kidwai N']","['Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Catholic University of Cuenca, Cuenca, ECU.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200515,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC7294869,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'diffuse large b cell lymphoma', 'richters transformation', 'tumor lysis syndrome', 'venetoclax']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/06/19 06:00,2020/06/19 06:01,['2020/06/19 06:00'],"['2020/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8145 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 May 15;12(5):e8145. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8145.,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depleted SETDB2 significantly decreased the breast cancer stem cell population and mammosphere formation in vitro and also inhibited breast tumor initiation and growth in vivo. Restoring SETDB2 expression rescued the defect in breast cancer stem cell maintenance. A mechanistic analysis showed that SETDB2 upregulated the transcription of the DeltaNp63alpha downstream Hedgehog pathway gene. SETDB2 also interacted with and methylated DeltaNp63alpha, and stabilized DeltaNp63alpha protein.

MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in infant and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and do not normally acquire secondary mutations compared to other leukaemias. To model these leukaemias, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing to induce MLL-AF9 (MA9) chromosomal rearrangements in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell lines and primary cells. By utilizing a dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA) approach targeting the breakpoint cluster region of murine Mll and Af9 equivalent to that in human MA9 rearrangements, we show efficient de novo generation of MA9 fusion product at the DNA and RNA levels in the bulk population. The leukaemic features of MA9-induced disease were observed including increased clonogenicity, enrichment of c-Kit-positive leukaemic stem cells and increased MA9 target gene expression.

METHODS: Participants (survivors, n = 45; survivor siblings, n = 27; controls, n = 45; control siblings, n = 41; 58% male) aged 8-18 (m = 11.64) completed a 7-day sleep diary and seven consecutive days of actigraphy. Parents (n = 90) completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire for each of their children. RESULTS: No between-group differences were found on measures of sleep diaries or actigraphy. Parents reported that survivor siblings had significantly poorer sleep habits than survivors or controls. For survivors, greater time off treatment and younger age at diagnosis were associated with less total sleep time, more wake after sleep onset, and decreased sleep efficiency via actigraphy. CONCLUSION: Sleep across all groups was consistent and below national guidelines. Although the survivor group did not have poorer sleep compared to their siblings or matched controls, within the survivor group, those who were diagnosed at an earlier age and those who were further off treatment had more disrupted sleep. Parent reports suggested that survivor siblings may be at risk for sleep problems.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The spectroscopic data suggested that the benzimidazolyl-phenol ligands act as N,O-chelate ligands through the iminic nitrogen and phenolic oxygen atoms. Elemental analysis indicated that lanthanide compounds were formed in a 1:2 stoichiometry (metal:ligand). In vitro biological evaluation was carried out using these complexes, exhibiting moderate cytotoxicity against six different human tumor cell lines (U251, human glioblastoma; HCT-15, colorectal carcinoma; MCF-7, breast epithelial adenocarcinoma; PC-3, prostate cancer; K562, myelogenous leukemia; SKLU-1, lung carcinoma) and lower toxicity against a non-cancerous cell line (COS-7, primate kidney). In addition, the antibacterial activity of the compounds was assessed against two gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115) and two gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27583) using the microdilution method. The results obtained show that the metal complexes exhibit higher biological activity than the free ligands, confirming a synergistic effect. Further benzimidazolyl-phenol derivatives were explored for the detection of bacteria using fluorescence imaging studies. Interestingly, the fluorescent properties of these compounds make them potential candidates to monitor the morphology of bacteria at different compound concentrations. Hence, the interaction of the ligand and complexes with model membranes mimicking those of bacteria was studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and molecular dynamics (MD), showing that both compounds decreased the enthalpy of transition in two model membranes as the concentration of the compounds increased. In addition, the main transition temperature was slightly reduced as a result of these interactions.",['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Aragon-Muriel, Alberto', 'Liscano-Martinez, Yamil', 'Rufino-Felipe, Ernesto', 'Morales-Morales, David', 'Onate-Garzon, Jose', 'Polo-Ceron, Dorian']","['Aragon-Muriel A', 'Liscano-Martinez Y', 'Rufino-Felipe E', 'Morales-Morales D', 'Onate-Garzon J', 'Polo-Ceron D']","['Laboratorio de Investigacion en Catalisis y Procesos (LICAP), Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Departamento de Quimica, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760001, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Genetica, Regeneracion y Cancer, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Instituto de Biologia, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin 050010, Colombia.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Cd.

Because most clinicians have low awareness of the disease, only scarce reports of AT exist in the literature, especially of cases with lymphoma/leukemia. CASE SUMMARY: A 7-year-old girl with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections was referred to our department because of unstable walking for 5 years and enlarged neck nodes for 2-mo duration. Physical examination revealed scleral telangiectasia and cerebellar ataxia. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein, decreased serum immunoglobulin, and decreased T cell function were the major findings of laboratory examination. Histological analysis of cervical lymph node biopsy was suggestive of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. Genetic examination showed heterozygous nucleotide variation of c.6679C>T and heterozygous nucleotide variation of c.5773 delG in the ATM gene; her parents were heterozygotes. The final diagnosis was AT with Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should strengthen their understanding of AT diseases.

Control theory might be an effective approach to this end, as proven by the long-established application to therapy design and testing. In this respect, we here introduce the Control Theory for Therapy Design (CT4TD) framework, which employs optimal control theory on patient-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) models, to deliver optimized therapeutic strategies. The definition of personalized PK/PD models allows to explicitly consider the physiological heterogeneity of individuals and to adapt the therapy accordingly, as opposed to standard clinical practices. CT4TD can be used in two distinct scenarios. At the time of the diagnosis, CT4TD allows to set optimized personalized administration strategies, aimed at reaching selected target drug concentrations, while minimizing the costs in terms of toxicity and adverse effects. Moreover, if longitudinal data on patients under treatment are available, our approach allows to adjust the ongoing therapy, by relying on simplified models of cancer population dynamics, with the goal of minimizing or controlling the tumor burden. CT4TD is highly scalable, as it employs the efficient dCRAB/RedCRAB optimization algorithm, and the results are robust, as proven by extensive tests on synthetic data. Furthermore, the theoretical framework is general, and it might be applied to any therapy for which a PK/PD model can be estimated, and for any kind of administration and cost. As a proof of principle, we present the application of CT4TD to Imatinib administration in Chronic Myeloid leukemia, in which we adopt a simplified model of cancer population dynamics. In particular, we show that the optimized therapeutic strategies are diversified among patients, and display improvements with respect to the current standard regime.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Angaroni, Graudenzi, Rossignolo, Maspero, Calarco, Piazza,', 'Montangero and Antoniotti.']","['Angaroni, Fabrizio', 'Graudenzi, Alex', 'Rossignolo, Marco', 'Maspero, Davide', 'Calarco, Tommaso', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Montangero, Simone', 'Antoniotti, Marco']","['Angaroni F', 'Graudenzi A', 'Rossignolo M', 'Maspero D', 'Calarco T', 'Piazza R', 'Montangero S', 'Antoniotti M']","['Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IBFM-CNR), Segrate, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Integrated Quantum Science and Technologies, Institute for Quantum Optics, Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IBFM-CNR), Segrate, Milan, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Forschungszentrum Julich, Institute of Quantum Control (PGI-8), Julich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Research Unit, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy ""G.

This improved survival rate comes with an increased risk for delayed neurocognitive effects in attention, working memory, and processing speed [2]. Predictive modeling and characterization of neurocognitive effects are critical to inform the family and also to identify patients for interventions targeting. Current state-of-the-art methods mainly use hypothesis-driven statistical testing methods to characterize and model such cognitive events. While these techniques have proven to be useful in understanding cognitive abilities, they are inadequate in explaining causal relationships, as well as individuality and variations. In this study, we developed multivariate data-driven models to measure the late neurocognitive effects of ALL patients using behavioral phenotypes, Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI) based tractography data, morphometry statistics, tractography measures, behavioral, and demographic variables. Alongside conventional machine learning and graph mining, we adopted ""Stability Selection"" to select the most relevant features and choose models that are consistent over a range of parameters.

Indeed, we detected aberrantly elevated levels of CD79a, B-cell adaptor for PI3K (BCAP) and phospholipase C (PLC)gamma2, key mediators of BCR signal, in CLL cells. As HSP90 is also overexpressed in CLL cells, we hypothesized that HSP90 could potentiate the BCR signal via stabilization of multiple key components of the BCR-signalosome. We found that HSP90 formed a multi-molecular complex with CD79a, BCAP, PLCgamma2, LYN, SYK, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and AKT and that, pharmacologic inhibition or partial depletion of HSP90 reduced the expression of these signal mediators in CLL cells. In addition, our findings also demonstrated that HSP90 could stabilize the tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN22 which positively regulates AKT phosphorylation, and the constitutively active fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) in CLL cells. Finally, HSP90 inhibition induced apoptosis in CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner likely via downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and XIAP, but not BCL2, reported to be overexpressed in CLL cells.

The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model exhibits multiple features of human T1D and enables mechanistic analysis of disease progression. However, the relationship between the mechanochemical signaling regulation of STZ-induced T1D and macrophage migration and phagocytosis is unclear. AIM: To study the mechanochemical regulation of STZ-induced macrophage response on pancreatic beta islet cells to gain a clearer understanding of T1D. METHODS: We performed experiments using different methods. We stimulated isolated pancreatic beta islet cells with STZ and then tested the macrophage migration and phagocytosis. RESULTS: In this study, we discovered that the integrin-associated surface factor CD47 played a critical role in immune defense in the STZ-induced T1D model by preventing pancreatic beta islet inflammation. In comparison with healthy mice, STZ-treated mice showed decreased levels of CD47 on islet cells and reduced interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), which negatively regulates macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. This resulted in weakened islet cell immune defense and promoted macrophage migration and phagocytosis of target inflammatory cells. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide-activated human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells also exhibited enhanced phagocytosis in the STZ-treated islets, and the aggressive attack of the inflammatory islets correlated with impaired CD47-SIRPalpha interactions. In addition, CD47 overexpression rescued the pre-labeled targeted cells.

Cell composition (chromatin and nuclear architecture) poses a strong risk for dynamic changes in the diseased condition. Since chromatin accessibility patterns play a major role in human diseases, it is therefore anticipated that a deconvolution tool based on open chromatin data will provide better performance in identifying cell composition. Herein, we have designed the deconvolution tool ""DeconPeaker,"" which can precisely define the uniqueness among subpopulations of cells using open chromatin datasets. Using this tool, we simultaneously evaluated chromatin accessibility and gene expression datasets to estimate cell types and their respective proportions in a mixture of samples. In comparison to other known deconvolution methods, we observed the lowest average root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.042) and the highest average correlation coefficient (r = 0.919) between the prediction and ""true"" proportion. As a proof-of-concept, we also tested chromatin accessibility data from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and successfully obtained unique cell types associated with AML progression. Furthermore, we showed that chromatin accessibility represents more essential characteristics in the identification of cell types than gene expression. Taken together, DeconPeaker as a powerful tool has the potential to combine different datasets (primarily, chromatin accessibility and gene expression) and define different cell types in mixtures. The Python package of DeconPeaker is now available at https://github.com/lihuamei/DeconPeaker.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Li, Sharma, Luo, Qin, Sun and Liu.']","['Li, Huamei', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Luo, Kun', 'Qin, Zhaohui S', 'Sun, Xiao', 'Liu, Hongde']","['Li H', 'Sharma A', 'Luo K', 'Qin ZS', 'Sun X', 'Liu H']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Xinjiang Evidence-Based Medicine Research Institute, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200508,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7269180,['NOTNLM'],"['cell type', 'chromatin accessibility', 'deconvolution', 'gene expression', 'mixture samples']",,2020/06/18 06:00,2020/06/18 06:01,['2020/06/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.00392 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 May 8;11:392. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00392. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Front Genet. 2020 Jun 15;11:693.

In Japan, the nationwide estimation of the number of HTLV-1 carriers was at least 1.08 million in 2006-2007. Furthermore, in 2016, the nationwide annual incidence of newly infected with HTLV-1 was first estimated to be 3.8 per 100,000 person-years based on the age-specific seroconversion rates of blood donors in almost all areas of Japan. The incidence rate was three times higher in women than in men, and it was estimated that at least 4,000 new HTLV-1 infections occur yearly among adolescents and adults in Japan. As well known that HTLV-1 infection alone is not a sufficient condition for ATL to develop. To date, a variety of molecular abnormalities and host susceptibilities have been reported as candidate progression factors for the development of ATL in HTLV-1-carriers. In particular, quite recently in Japan, a variety of immunosuppressive conditions have been recognized as the most important host susceptibilities associated with the development of ATL from HTLV-1-carrier status. Furthermore, in 2013-2016 in Japan, a new nationwide epidemiological study of ATL was conducted targeting patients newly diagnosed with ATL in 2010-2011, from which the most current knowledge about the epidemiological characteristics of Japanese patients with ATL was updated as follows: (1) continuing regional unevenness of the distribution of people with HTLV-1, (2) further aging, with the mean age at diagnosis being 67.5 years, (3) declining M/F ratio, (4) increase of the lymphoma subtype, (5) sex differences in subtype distribution, (6) age differences in subtype distribution, and (7) comorbidity condition. In particular, 32.2% of ATL patients had comorbid malignancies other than ATL. However, the number of deaths due to ATL in Japan has been relatively stable, at around 1,000 patients annually, without significant decline from 1999 to 2017.

ATL carries a dismal prognosis. ATL classifies into four subtypes (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering) which display different clinical features, prognosis and response to therapy, hence requiring different clinical management. Smoldering and chronic subtypes respond well to antiretroviral therapy using the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha (IFN) with a significant prolongation of survival. Conversely, the watch and wait strategy or chemotherapy for these indolent subtypes allies with a poor long-term outcome. Acute ATL is associated with chemo-resistance and dismal prognosis. Lymphoma subtypes respond better to intensive chemotherapy but survival remains poor. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) results in long-term survival in roughly one third of transplanted patients but only a small percentage of patients can make it to transplant. Overall, current treatments of aggressive ATL are not satisfactory. Prognosis of refractory or relapsed patients is dismal with some encouraging results when using lenalidomide or mogamulizumab. To overcome resistance and prevent relapse, preclinical or pilot clinical studies using targeted therapies such as arsenic/IFN, monoclonal antibodies, epigenetic therapies are promising but warrant further clinical investigation. Anti-ATL vaccines including Tax peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, induced Tax-specific CTL responses in ATL patients. Finally, based on the progress in understanding the pathophysiology of ATL, and the risk-adapted treatment approaches to different ATL subtypes, treatment strategies of ATL should take into account the host immune responses and the host microenvironment including HTLV-1 infected non-malignant cells. Herein, we will provide a summary of novel treatments of ATL in vitro, in vivo, and in early clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2020 El Hajj, Tsukasaki, Cheminant, Bazarbachi, Watanabe and', 'Hermine.']","['El Hajj, Hiba', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Cheminant, Morgane', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Hermine, Olivier']","['El Hajj H', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Cheminant M', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Watanabe T', 'Hermine O']","['Department of Experimental Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology, International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'INSERM UMR 1163 and CNRS URL 8254, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Necker-Enfants Malades University Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'INSERM UMR 1163 and CNRS URL 8254, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Necker-Enfants Malades University Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200528,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC7270167,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'arsenic', 'epigenetic therapies', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'targeted therapies', 'vaccine']",,2020/06/18 06:00,2020/06/18 06:01,['2020/06/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.01062 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 May 28;11:1062. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01062. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we aimed to identify the key genes and miRNAs involved in adult AML with FLT3 mutation and find possible therapeutic targets for improving treatment. Materials: Gene and miRNA expression data and survival profiles were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. EdgeR of R platform was applied to identify the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs (DEGs, DE-miRNAs). Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed by Metascape and DAVID. And protein-protein interaction network, miRNA-mRNA regulatory network and clustering modules analyses were performed by STRING database and Cytoscape software. Results: Survival analysis showed FLT3 mutation led to adverse outcome in AML. 24 DE-miRNAs (6 upregulated, 18 downregulated) and 250 DEGs (54 upregulated, 196 downregulated) were identified. Five miRNAs had prognostic value and the results matched their expression levels (miR-1-3p, miR-10a-3p, miR-10a-5p, miR-133a-3p and miR-99b-5p). GO analysis showed DEGs were enriched in skeletal system development, blood vessel development, cartilage development, tissue morphogenesis, cartilage morphogenesis, cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, response to growth factor, cell-substrate adhesion and so on. The KEGG analysis showed DEGs were enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion. Seven genes (LAMC1, COL3A1, APOB, COL1A2, APP, SPP1 and FSTL1) were simultaneously identified by hub gene analysis and module analysis. SLC14A1, ARHGAP5 and PIK3CA, the target genes of miR-10a-3p, resulted in poor prognosis. Conclusion: Our study successfully identified molecular markers, processes and pathways affected by FLT3 mutation in AML.

Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), as a typical derivative of artemisinin (ART), can efficiently inhibit leukemia, but the controversial mechanisms are still controversial. Many reports showed that tumor cells acquire energy through the glycolysis pathway, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays a crucial role in regulating glycolysis. However, it is unclear whether PKM2 or other key molecules are involved in DHA induced cytotoxicity in leukemia cells. Thus, this paper systematically investigated the anticancer effect and mechanism of DHA on human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Methods: In vitro, cytotoxicity was detected with CCK-8. Glucose uptake, lactate production and pyruvate kinase activity were investigated to evaluate the effect of DHA on K562 cells. To elucidate the cellular metabolism alterations induced by DHA, the extracellular acidification rate was assessed using Seahorse XF96 extracellular flux analyzer. Immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and Western blotting were used to investigate the molecular mechanism. Results: We found that DHA prevented cell proliferation in K562 cells through inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. Lactate product and glucose uptake were inhibited after DHA treatment. Results showed that DHA modulates glucose uptake through downregulating glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in both gene and protein levels. The cytotoxicity of DHA on K562 cells was significantly reversed by PKM2 agonist DASA-58.

Purpose and Methods: In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a sensitive and simple ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of gilteritinib in plasma and to investigate whether CYP3A4 inhibitors (fluconazole and itraconazole) could influence the pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib from a drug-drug interaction study in rats. Sample preparation was done by a simple protein crash with acetonitrile containing the internal standard (IS) pirfenidone, followed by UPLC-MS/MS quantification. Results: The assay was successfully validated in a 1-500 ng/mL calibration range for gilteritinib, where the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was set at 1 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions for gilteritinib were less than 10.6%, and the accuracies were in the range of -14.5% to 11.1%. Recovery and matrix effect of the analyte and IS were acceptable, and the analyte was stable during the assay and storage in plasma samples. The validated UPLC-MS/MS method was successfully applied to a drug-drug interaction study between gilteritinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors (fluconazole and itraconazole) in rats. Itraconazole significantly increased the exposure of gilteritinib, and affected the pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib in rats, not fluconazole. Conclusion: A further clinical study should be conducted to investigate the effect of itraconazole on the metabolism of gilteritinib in subjects.",['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Qiong', 'Chen, Zhe', 'Chen, Dingwen', 'Ye, Xia-Yan']","['Wang Q', 'Chen Z', 'Chen D', 'Ye XY']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Wenzhou People's Hospital, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Wenzhou People's Hospital, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Wenzhou People's Hospital, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Brain Surgery, The People's Hospital of Lishui, Lishui, Zhejiang 323000, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200526,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC7266109,['NOTNLM'],"['CYP3A4 inhibitors', 'UPLC-MS/MS', 'drug-drug interaction', 'gilteritinib', 'pharmacokinetic']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2020/06/18 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/06/18 06:00'],"['2020/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S243760 [doi]', '243760 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 May 26;14:2061-2067. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S243760. eCollection 2020.,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3105-3589'],20210329,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the risk of serious infections, we performed a large population-based matched cohort study in Sweden including 8 363 MPN patients and 32,405 controls using high-quality registers between the years 1992-2013 with follow-up until 2015. The hazard ratio (HR) of any infection was 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.9-2.0), of bacterial infections 1.9 (1.8-2.0), and of viral infections 2.1 (1.9-2.3). One of the largest risk increases was that of sepsis, HR 2.6 (2.4-2.9). The HR of any infection was highest in primary myelofibrosis 3.7 (3.2-4.1), and significantly elevated in all MPN subtypes; 1.7 (1.6-1.8) in polycythemia vera and 1.7 (1.5-1.8) in essential thrombocythemia. There was no significant difference in risk of infections between untreated patients and patients treated with hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha during the years 2006-2013.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of escalating doses of CPX-351 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at high risk of induction mortality with standard chemotherapy determined through assessment of leukemia and patient-related risk factors for intensive chemotherapy in an open-label, phase II trial. Patients were randomized to receive 50 or 75 units/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5. Once safety was established, a 100 units/m(2) arm was opened. Fifty-six patients were enrolled, 16, 24, and 16 in the 50, 75, and 100 units/m(2) arms, respectively. The composite complete remission rate (complete remission + complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) was lowest with 50 units/m(2) (19%) compared with 75 units/m(2) (38%) and 100 units/m(2) (44%) (P = 0.35).

In the last few years, following the description of driver mutations in JAK2, MPL and CALR, the diagnostic criteria for PV and ET were revised, making the identification of very early stages feasible. Scores for identifying patients at different risk of thrombosis were refined, and they largely guide therapeutic decisions. Treatment is therefore mainly focused on reduction of thrombosis risk, control of myeloproliferation, improvement of symptomatic burden, and management of disease-associated complications.

The presence of proviral DNA has been the major diagnostic indicator of BLV infection. However in the course of BLV infection, the viral genome can be dormant, without detectable gene expression, resulting in limited impact on infected animals. At present, there is limited knowledge regarding haematological indices in dairy cattle that could indicate activation of the BLV genome and suggest reactivated BLV infection. In this study, BLV infection and BLV genome reactivation were evaluated based on the presence of BLV DNA and BLV env gene transcripts, respectively. BLV RNA transcription was confirmed. Among 93 whole blood samples obtained from asymptomatic dairy cattle, the prevalence of BLV proviral DNA and transcripts was 93.5% (n = 87/93) and 83.9% (n = 78/93), respectively. Between groups with and without BLV, the mean counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes in whole blood were significantly associated with the presence of BLV RNA (P < 0.05), but not with BLV proviral DNA.

Fibroblasts, which are components of the paraneoplastic stroma, play a crucial role in the wound-healing process. Activated fibroblasts accumulate in the wound and are involved in many aspects of the tissue remodeling cascade that initiates the repair process and prevents further tissue damage. The pathophysiological roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment have attracted increasing interest. CAFs play crucial roles in tumor progression and the response to chemotherapy. Several cytokines and chemokines are involved in the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs, and some of these form a feedback loop between cancer cells and CAFs. In addition, the physical force between tumor cells and CAFs promotes cooperative invasion or co-migration of both types of cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are secreted by both cancer cells and CAFs, and mediate the epigenetic modification of CAFs. This enhances the pro-tumorigenic function of CAFs mediated by promoting actomyosin contractility and extracellular matrix remodeling to form the tracks used for collective cancer cell migration. The concept of intra-tumoral CAF heterogeneity refers to the presence of inflammatory CAFs with low levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and high levels of IL-6 expression, which are in striking contrast to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-dependent myofibroblastic CAFs with high alpha-SMA expression levels. CAF populations that suppress tumor growth and progression through stroma-specific Hedgehog (Hh) activation have been detected in different murine tumor models including those of the bladder, colon, and pancreas. A new therapeutic strategy targeting CAFs is the ""stromal switch,"" in which tumor-promoting CAFs are changed into tumor-retarding CAFs with attenuated stromal stiffness. Several molecular mechanisms that can be exploited to design personalized anticancer therapies targeting CAFs remain to be elucidated. Strategies aimed at targeting the tumor stroma as well as tumor cells themselves have attracted academic attention for their application in precision medicine. This novel review discusses the role of the activation of EGFR, Wnt/beta-catenin, Hippo, TGF-beta, and JAK/STAT cascades in CAFs in relation to the chemoresistance and invasive/metastatic behavior of cancer cells. For instance, although activated EGFR signaling contributes to collective cell migration in cooperation with CAFs, an activated Hippo pathway is responsible for stromal stiffness resulting in the collapse of neoplastic blood vessels. Therefore, identifying the signaling pathways that are activated under specific conditions is crucial for precision medicine.",,"['Yoshida, Go J']",['Yoshida GJ'],"['Department of Immunological Diagnosis, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-1-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan. medical21go@yahoo.co.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200616,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC7296768,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer-associated fibroblasts', 'Canonical Wnt signaling pathway', 'Collective cell migration', 'Drug repositioning', 'Heterogeneity', 'Interstitial fluid pressure', 'Receptor tyrosine kinase', 'Stromal stiffness', 'TGF-beta', 'YAP/TAZ']",,2020/06/18 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/06/18 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-020-01611-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-020-01611-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Jun 16;39(1):112. doi: 10.1186/s13046-020-01611-0.,['19K23898/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],1,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1472-892X'],20210204,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*pathology', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late onset acquisition of internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) at a high variant allele frequency often contributes to full transformation to a highly proliferative, rapidly progressive disease with poor outcome. The FLT3-ITD mutation is targetable with approved FLT3 small molecule inhibitors, including midostaurin and gilteritinib. However, outside of patients receiving allogeneic transplant, most patients fail to respond or relapse, suggesting alternative approaches of therapy will be required. We employed genome-wide pooled CRISPR knockout screening as a method for large-scale identification of targets whose knockout produces a phenotypic effect that enhances the antitumor properties of FLT3 inhibitors. Among the candidate targets we identified the effect of XPO1 knockout to be synergistic with midostaurin treatment. Next, we validated the genetic finding with pharmacologic combination of the slowly reversible XPO1 inhibitor selinexor with midostaurin and gilteritinib in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines and primary patient samples.

Currently, there are few data concerning beta3-AR in myeloid malignancies. Here, we evaluated beta3-AR in myeloid leukemia cell lines and the effect of beta3-AR antagonist SR59230A. In addition, we investigated the potential role of beta3-AR blockade in doxorubicin resistance. Using flow cytometry, we assessed cell death in different in vitro myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562, KCL22, HEL, HL60) treated with SR59230A in hypoxia and normoxia; furthermore, we analyzed beta3-AR expression. We used healthy bone marrow cells (BMCs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cord blood as control samples. Finally, we evaluated the effect of SR59230A plus doxorubicin on K562 and K562/DOX cell lines; K562/DOX cells are resistant to doxorubicin and show P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression. We found that SR59230A increased cancer cell lines apoptosis especially in hypoxia, resulting in selective activity for cancer cells; moreover, beta3-AR expression was higher in malignancies, particularly under hypoxic condition. Finally, we observed that SR59230A plus doxorubicin increased doxorubicin resistance reversion mainly in hypoxia, probably acting on P-gp. Together, these data point to beta3-AR as a new target and beta3-AR blockade as a potential approach in myeloid leukemias.",,"['Calvani, Maura', 'Dabraio, Annalisa', 'Bruno, Gennaro', 'De Gregorio, Veronica', 'Coronnello, Marcella', 'Bogani, Costanza', 'Ciullini, Sara', 'Marca, Giancarlo la', 'Vignoli, Marina', 'Chiarugi, Paola', 'Nardi, Margherita', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria', 'Filippi, Luca', 'Favre, Claudio']","['Calvani M', 'Dabraio A', 'Bruno G', 'De Gregorio V', 'Coronnello M', 'Bogani C', 'Ciullini S', 'Marca G', 'Vignoli M', 'Chiarugi P', 'Nardi M', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Filippi L', 'Favre C']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Onco-Hematologic Pediatric Center, University Hospital of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', ""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Medical Surgical Fetal-Neonatal Department, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Meyer University Children's Hospital, 50139 Florence, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200612,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7352890,['NOTNLM'],"['chemoresistance', 'myeloid leukemia', 'beta3-adrenoreceptor']",,2020/06/18 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/06/18 06:00'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21124210 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21124210 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 12;21(12). pii: ijms21124210. doi: 10.3390/ijms21124210.,,12,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0750-4706', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6252-3825', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7715-8207', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5310-9147']",20210216,"['0 (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino)-2-propanol oxalate)', '0 (Adrenergic beta-3 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Propanolamines)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adrenergic beta-3 Receptor Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Propanolamines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations are unique to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease characterized by clonal expansion, impaired differentiation and the proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Despite our improved understanding of NPM1 mutations and their consequences, the underlying leukemia pathogenesis is still unclear.

As of 4 June 2020, more than 1.8 million confirmed cases and over 108 thousand deaths have been reported in this country. Few studies have examined nationwide modeling of COVID-19 incidence in the United States particularly using machine-learning algorithms. Thus, we collected and prepared a database of 57 candidate explanatory variables to examine the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network in predicting the cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates across the continental United States. Our results indicated that a single-hidden-layer MLP could explain almost 65% of the correlation with ground truth for the holdout samples. Sensitivity analysis conducted on this model showed that the age-adjusted mortality rates of ischemic heart disease, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia, together with two socioeconomic and environmental factors (median household income and total precipitation), are among the most substantial factors for predicting COVID-19 incidence rates. Moreover, results of the logistic regression model indicated that these variables could explain the presence/absence of the hotspots of disease incidence that were identified by Getis-Ord Gi* (p < 0.05) in a geographic information system environment.

Little is known about factors that drive S. maltophilia infection. We evaluated the microbiome and cumulative antibiotic use as predictors of S. maltophilia infection in AML patients receiving remission induction chemotherapy (RIC). METHODS: Subanalysis of a prospective, observational cohort of patients with AML receiving RIC between September 2013 and August 2015 was performed. Fecal and oral microbiome samples collected from initiation of RIC until neutrophil recovery were assessed for the relative abundance of Stenotrophomonas via 16S rRNA gene quantitation. The primary outcome, microbiologically proven S. maltophilia infection, was analyzed using a time-varying Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Of 90 included patients, 8 (9%) developed S. maltophilia infection (pneumonia, n = 6; skin-soft tissue, n = 2); 4/8 (50%) patients were bacteremic; and 7/8 (88%) patients with S. maltophilia infection had detectable levels of Stenotrophomonas vs 22/82 (27%) without infection (P < .01). An oral Stenotrophomonas relative abundance of 36% predicted infection (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 93%). No association of S. maltophilia infection with fecal relative abundance was found. Cumulative meropenem exposure was associated with increased infection risk (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.35; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify the oral microbiome as a potential source for S. maltophilia infection and highlight cumulative carbapenem use as a risk factor for S. maltophilia in leukemia patients. These data suggest that real-time monitoring of the oral cavity might identify patients at risk for S. maltophilia infection.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

We hypothesized that a subgroup of children receiving intrathecal cytarabine develops subclinical vasospasm, which may contribute to long-term neurocognitive sequelae of cancer. METHODS: We used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to serially evaluate cerebral blood flow velocities in participants </=25 years old receiving intrathecal cytarabine for hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: Four of 18 participants (22%) met the criteria for subclinical vasospasm within 4 days of intrathecal cytarabine administration. The distribution of oncologic diagnoses differed between the vasospasm and non-vasospasm groups (p = 0.02). Acute myeloid leukemia was identified as a potential risk factor for vasospasm. Children with vasospasm were more likely to have received intravenous cytarabine (75% versus 0%, p = 0.01) and less likely to have received steroids (25% versus 100%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A subpopulation of children with hematologic malignancies develops subclinical vasospasm after intrathecal cytarabine treatment. Future research is needed to determine the long-term clinical consequences of cerebral vasospasm in this population. IMPACT: A subset of children with hematologic malignancies who receive intrathecal cytarabine experience subclinical cerebral vasospasm, as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Of children receiving intrathecal cytarabine, those who develop cerebral vasospasm are more likely to have diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, more likely to receive concurrent intravenous cytarabine, and less likely to receive steroids as part of their chemotherapy regimen, as compared with children without vasospasm.

In human cryptorchidism, persisting gonocytes may lead to seminoma. Using Bcl2-associated X knockout (BAXKO) mice, we investigated apoptosis in gonocyte development during mouse minipuberty. Testes from BAXKO, heterozygous (HET), and wild-type (WT) littermates were collected on postnatal days 1, 3, 6, and 9 (n = 6/group), labelled with antibodies against mouse vasa homologue (MVH, germ cell marker) or promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-factor (PLZF, SSC marker) and imaged for cell counting. Total germ cells/tubule, i.e., the number of germ cells on and off the basement membrane (BM), were counted using Image J followed by 2-way ANOVA analysis with Prism. Total PLZF+ germ cells/tubule, PLZF+ germ cells/tubule off BM, total MVH+ germ cells/tubule, and MVH+ germ cells off BM/tubule were significantly higher at day 9 in BAXKO compared to WT and HET mice (p < 0.01). In conclusion, knockout of BAX in mouse leads to gonocytes persisting at the centre of the tubules after minipuberty, which failed to migrate and transform into SSC, indicating the important role of apoptosis is to eliminate undifferentiated gonocytes during transformation. Failed apoptosis in gonocytes may be the cause of malignancy in humans with cryptorchidism.","['(c) 2020 S.

Interestingly, the C-terminally truncated form of RUNX1 and RUNX1 fusion proteins are similarly considered important contributors to leukemogenesis. Here, we describe a 59-year-old male patient who was initially diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, inv(16)(p13;q22)/CBFB-MYH11 (FAB classification M4Eo). He achieved complete remission and negative CBFB-MYH11 status with daunorubicin/cytarabine combination chemotherapy but relapsed 3 years later. Cytogenetic analysis of relapsed leukemia cells revealed CBFB-MYH11 negativity and complex chromosomal abnormalities without inv(16)(p13;q22). RNA-seq identified the glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kinase 2 (GRIK2) gene on 6q16 as a novel fusion partner for RUNX1 in this case. Specifically, the fusion of RUNX1 to the GRIK2 antisense strand (RUNX1-GRIK2as) generated multiple missplicing transcripts. Because extremely low levels of wild-type GRIK2 were detected in leukemia cells, RUNX1-GRIK2as was thought to drive the pathogenesis associated with the RUNX1-GRIK2 fusion. The truncated RUNX1 generated from RUNX1-GRIK2as induced the expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor on 32D myeloid leukemia cells and enhanced proliferation in response to G-CSF. In summary, the RUNX1-GRIK2as fusion emphasizes the importance of aberrantly truncated RUNX1 in leukemogenesis.","['(c) 2020 S.

OBJECTIVE: This paper investigates how patients diagnosed with Leukemia respond to different graph representations of prognosis information. METHODS: We conducted a user-centered design process, for which three experimental prototypes (vertical, horizontal, and pie charts) with and without animation were developed. Twelve patients diagnosed with Leukemia were recruited to evaluate the prototypes using a think-aloud interview protocol. RESULTS: The results showed a preference for vertical bar charts over horizontal and pie charts. In addition, we found that animating the charts to ""fill-up"" generally conveyed a subtle sense of positivity even when diagnosis information was negative. The value of explicitly indicating numeric values and scale varied but the results suggest that what matters to participants is having control over when such details would be seen. The results also point out that making sense of prognostic information involves balancing the tension between information utility and patient judgments about authenticity and credibility of prognosis information. CONCLUSION: Our findings are important for the design and implementation of representations of prognostic information. They suggest that an appropriate visual format can reduce potential negative effects in conveying prognosis information, as well as helping patients stay positive and motivated for cure in the delivery of prognosis information.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We have shown earlier that B-CLL cells exhibit elevated total amount and available activity of micro-calpain, belonging to a family of ubiquitous, strongly Ca-dependent proteases, involved in the control of proliferation and apoptosis. In this study we attempted to estimate a potential clinical value of mu-calpain in relation to B-CLL clinical staging in patients with extremely high lymphocytosis and studied the molecular mechanisms associating calpain activity with clinical progress of the disease. We observed significant correlations between the amounts of intracellular mu-calpain and clinical staging of the disease, with RAI stage 1 corresponding to the highest calpain amounts in the leukemic cells. There was also a positive, statistically significant correlation between the amount of mu-calpain and phosphorylated (p)ZAP-70 in B-CLL lymphocytes. Calpain activity in the B-CLL cells is associated with decreased activities of pro-apoptotic caspases -3 and -9, and reciprocally with an increased amount of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Together, all of these findings make calpain activity in B-CLL cells a promising target modifying the properties of these cells and facilitating therapy.

The pronounced antiproliferative effects of flavonoids have prompted studies to elucidate their mode of action against tumor cells. The anticancer properties of myricetin, a 3',4',5'-tri-hydroxylated flavonol, have been confirmed for a number of neoplasms, but myricitrin, its 3-O-rhamnoside derivative found in fruits and other parts of edible plants, has been scarcely investigated as a chemopreventive agent. This study evaluated the antiproliferative potential of myricitrin obtained from Combretum lanceolatum (Combretaceae) against MCF7 (breast), PC-3 (prostate), HT-29 (colon), 786-0 (kidney), and HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cancer cell lines, using the sulforhodamine B and tetrazolium salt assays. Myricitrin proved most effective in inhibiting growth of HL-60 cells (GI50 = 53.4 mumol.L(-1)), yet showed weak antiproliferative activity against other cell lines. Possible cytotoxic mechanisms involving inhibition of topoisomerases I and IIalpha by myricitrin were also evaluated, revealing inhibitory activity only against topoisomerase IIalpha. The results suggested that topoisomerase IIalpha inhibition is the probable mechanism responsible for the antiproliferative activity of myricitrin. In vivo mutagenicity by myricitrin and its possible antimutagenic effect on doxorubicin-induced DNA damage were also investigated by performing the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) on Drosophila melanogaster.

The limited number of treatment options for patients with high risk MDS highlights a need for new therapeutic options. Venetoclax is an inhibitor of the BCL-2 protein which, when combined with an HMA, has shown high response rates in unfit and previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia.

We carried out this study to explore the expression profile of miRNAs in intermediate risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and locate certain miRNAs as biomarkers. We profiled differentially expressed miRNAs by performing miRNA sequencing analysis in the patients' samples. Bioinformatic analysis showed the most significantly expressed genes mostly involved in cellular component organization, cell differentiation, and cell development. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction validated the expression of miR-582-5p in different groups of AML samples. It was confirmed that miR-582-5p was downregulated in newly diagnosed AML and relapse/refractory AML compared with CR AML or controls. Among intermediate risk AML patients with normal cytogenetics, a lower level of miR-582-5p is correlated with an unfavorable outcome, and a shorter overall survival. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that miR-582-5p could inhibit proliferation, suppress migration, and invasion ability and induce apoptosis of leukemia cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-582-5p can increase sensitivity of cells to Ara-C. In conclusion, miR-582-5p can serve as an antioncogenic biomarker in intermediate risk AML with normal cytogenetics for risk classification and outcome prediction. These results showed a novel role for miR-582-5p in predicting the prognosis and promoting the tumor growth of AML.",['(c) 2020 International Federation for Cell Biology.'],"['Wang, Xiaman', 'Feng, Yuandong', 'Zhang, Peihua', 'Chen, Hongli', 'Bai, Ju', 'Wang, Fangxia', 'He, Aili']","['Wang X', 'Feng Y', 'Zhang P', 'Chen H', 'Bai J', 'Wang F', 'He A']","[""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Hematology Department, National-Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Biodiagnostics and Biotherapy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200626,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,,['NOTNLM'],"['bioinformatic analysis', 'gain- and loss-of-function', 'microRNA profiling', 'outcome prediction', 'risk assessment']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.11408 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2020 Oct;44(10):2021-2030. doi: 10.1002/cbin.11408.

We here evaluated expression of the three FcgammaR on peripheral blood AML blasts. Using flow cytometry, we found heterogeneous expression of the FcgammaR throughout the patient cohort. Correlation of expression levels with disease outcome revealed significantly shorter OS in patients with CD16(+) blasts at first diagnosis.

It is frequently reported in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but rarely in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Spinal cord compression caused by CML-associated GS is exceedingly rare, with only few cases reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which GS caused such extensive compression.Findings: A 37-year-old man with CML suffered from back pain for 2 months. Notably, he had already achieved molecular remission (MR) after receiving imatinib mesylate for CML; bone marrow aspiration results were consistent with CML in chronic phase. Image examination revealed that developed GS occupied nearly the entire thoracic spinal canal, thereby causing extensive spinal cord compression. The tumor completely diminished after his treatment regimen was upgraded. He showed no signs of recurrence after 1-year follow-up.Conclusion: Extramedullary infiltration of CML should be taken into consideration when a mass lesion develops and compresses the spinal cord in a CML patient who has been receiving routine and standard treatment modalities; thus, a sudden and unexpected progression mandates a refinement and upgrade of treatment modality.",,"['Han, Shiyuan', 'Li, Yongning', 'Niu, Tong', 'Wang, Xin', 'Li, Zhimin', 'Ren, Xinyu', 'Gao, Jun']","['Han S', 'Li Y', 'Niu T', 'Wang X', 'Li Z', 'Ren X', 'Gao J']","[""Department of Neurosurgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of International Medical Service, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200616,England,J Spinal Cord Med,The journal of spinal cord medicine,9504452,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Granulocytic sarcoma', 'Imatinib resistance', 'Spinal cord compression']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10790268.2020.1771506 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Spinal Cord Med. 2020 Jun 16:1-5. doi: 10.1080/10790268.2020.1771506.,,,,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, a comprehensive examination of the prognosis role of AS events in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not yet been illuminated. In this study, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify survival-related AS events and independent prognostic predictors. The interaction between splicing factors (SFs) and AS events was visualized by Cytoscape. A total of 3013 survival-associated AS events in 1977 genes were screened in 151 AML patients. Interestingly, the majority (2031 events) were revealed to be protective factors. Furthermore, the prediction models were constructed for each type of AS and all of them displayed good performance in predicting prognosis, considering their area under curve values of the receiver operating characteristic were all above 0.7. Notably, the splicing regulatory network displayed the underlying interaction networks between SFs and AS events.

Effective tumor biomarkers for erlotinib in the treatment of AML remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that erlotinib in vitro significantly inhibits the growth of the FLT3-ITD mutant AML cell MV4-11 and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cell via targeting FLT3, a certified valid target for the effective treatment of AML. In vivo, oral administration of erlotinib at 100 mg/kg/day induced rapid MV4-11 tumor regression and significantly prolonged the survival time of bone marrow engraftment AML mice via inhibiting the FLT3 signal. Thus, the therapeutic benefits of erlotinib on AML are due to its ability to target FLT3. FLT3-ITD mutation is an effective biomarker for erlotinib during AML treatment. In addition, we also demonstrate that erlotinib inhibits the activity of AML cell KG-1 (no FLT3 expression) by targeting Lyn. Recently, single cell analysis demonstrated that intratumoral heterogeneity are one of the contributors in the relapse and FLT3 inhibitor resistance. Erlotinib could effectively inhibit the MV4-11 cells via targeting FLT3, and inhibit KG-1 cells via targeting Lyn. Therefore, Erlotinib also has the potential to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity via targeting FLT3 and Lyn.",['(c) 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['Cao, Zhi-Xing', 'Guo, Chuan-Jie', 'Song, Xiaominting', 'He, Jun-Lin', 'Tan, Lu', 'Yu, Si', 'Zhang, Ruo-Qi', 'Peng, Fu', 'Peng, Cheng', 'Li, Yu-Zhi']","['Cao ZX', 'Guo CJ', 'Song X', 'He JL', 'Tan L', 'Yu S', 'Zhang RQ', 'Peng F', 'Peng C', 'Li YZ']","['Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.', 'Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Key Laboratory of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources in Sichuan Province-Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Co-founded by Sichuan Province and MOST, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200615,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3', '*Lyn', '*erlotinib', '*intratumoral heterogeneity']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/02/27 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.201902922RR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 Aug;34(8):10182-10190. doi: 10.1096/fj.201902922RR.

As more and more new drugs and combinations are becoming part of therapeutic armamentarium, it becomes highly pertinent to understand the evidence for each of the treatment options to select the right drug for the right patient. We summarize the recent data of the available frontline treatment options. RECENT FINDINGS: The novel agents can overcome adverse biological attributes and provide long-term disease control. MRD may become a reliable surrogate for survival in the evaluation of future therapies. FCR still remains one of the best options in a young fit CLL with mutated IGVH. Long-term follow-up data of ibrutinib confirm its efficacy and safety in both high-risk and elderly TN-CLL patients. A combination of venetoclax with obinutuzumab has provided the hope of fixed-duration therapy and the potential for functional cure in TN-CLL. Several other trials testing the efficacy of other targeted agents and the optimal sequencing approaches are underway. Chemoimmunotherapy holds its ground as an effective treatment in the IGVH-mutated CLL.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the independent effect of sex on MPN presentation and outcomes. A total of 815 patients with essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, or primary myelofibrosis were evaluated between 2005 and 2019, and the association of sex with presenting phenotype, JAK2 V617F burden, progression, and survival was examined. Men presented more often with primary myelofibrosis vs essential thrombocytosis (relative risk, 3.2; P < .001) and polycythemia vera (relative risk, 2.1; P < .001), had higher rates of transformation to secondary myelofibrosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; P = .013) and acute myeloid leukemia (HR, 3.67; P < .001), and worse survival (HR, 1.63; P = .001) independent of age, phenotype at diagnosis, and MPN-specific mutation. Men had higher JAK2 V617F allele burdens in their CD34+ cells (P = .001), acquired more somatic mutations (P = .012) apart from the MPN-specific mutations, and had an increased frequency of 1 (odds ratio, 2.35; P = .017) and 2 (odds ratio, 20.20; P = .011) high-risk mutations independent of age, phenotype, and driver mutation. Male sex is an independent predictor of poor outcomes in MPNs. This seems to be due to an increased risk of non-MPN-specific somatic mutations, particularly high-risk mutations, rather than MPN-specific mutation allele frequency. Conversely, disease progression in female subjects is more dependent on JAK2 mutation allele burden than on acquisition of other somatic mutations.

Although currently used GVHD treatment regimens target the donor immune system, we explored here an approach that aims at protecting and regenerating Paneth cells (PCs) and intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Glucagon-like-peptide-2 (GLP-2) is an enteroendocrine tissue hormone produced by intestinal L cells. We observed that acute GVHD reduced intestinal GLP-2 levels in mice and patients developing GVHD. Treatment with the GLP-2 agonist, teduglutide, reduced de novo acute GVHD and steroid-refractory GVHD, without compromising graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in multiple mouse models. Mechanistically GLP-2 substitution promoted regeneration of PCs and ISCs, which enhanced production of antimicrobial peptides and caused microbiome changes. GLP-2 expanded intestinal organoids and reduced expression of apoptosis-related genes. Low numbers of L cells in intestinal biopsies and high serum levels of GLP-2 were associated with a higher incidence of nonrelapse mortality in patients undergoing allo-HCT. Our findings indicate that L cells are a target of GVHD and that GLP-2-based treatment of acute GVHD restores intestinal homeostasis via an increase of ISCs and PCs without impairing GVL effects.

Genome-wide chromatin and transcriptome profiling in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells revealed that Tip60 colocalizes with c-Myc and that Tip60 deletion suppress the expression of Myc target genes, which are associated with critical biological processes for HSC maintenance, cell cycling, and DNA repair. Notably, acetylated H2A.Z (acH2A.Z) was enriched at the Tip60-bound active chromatin, and Tip60 deletion induced a robust reduction in the acH2A.Z/H2A.Z ratio.

It is not clear whether these diverse isomiRs have potential relationships and whether they contribute to miRNA:mRNA interactions.

Multiple isomiRs within gene families showed similar functions to their canonical miRNAs, indicating selection of the predominant sequence. IsomiRs containing novel seed regions showed increased/decreased biological function depending on whether they had more/less specific target mRNAs than their annotated seed. Few gene ontology(GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were shared among the target genes of the annotated seeds and the novel seeds. Various let-7 isomiRs with novel seed regions may cause opposing drug responses despite the fact that they are generated from the same miRNA locus and have highly similar sequences. IsomiRs, especially the dominant isomiRs with shifted seeds, may disturb the coding-non-coding RNA regulatory network.

Despite its efficacy in treating leukemia, it can lead to severe peripheral neuropathy in a subgroup of the patients. Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating and painful side-effect that can severely impact an individual's quality of life. Currently, there are no established predictors of peripheral neuropathy incidence during the early stage of chemotherapeutic treatment. As a result, patients who are not susceptible to peripheral neuropathy may receive sub-therapeutic treatment due to an empirical upper cap on the dose, while others may experience severe neuropathy at the same dose. Contrary to previous genomics based approaches, we employed a metabolomics approach to identify small sets of metabolites that can be used to predict a patient's susceptibility to peripheral neuropathy at different time points during the treatment.

METHODS: The randomized controlled trials included were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library. We evaluated and cross-checked the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing daunorubicin combined with cytarabine (DA) and idarubicin combined with cytarabine (IA) by two reviewers independently according to Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviewers of Interventions. The data of meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies containing 3140 patients were included. The primary outcomes were complete remission (CR), CR in one course (CR1), CR in two courses (CR2), overall survival (OS), and relapse rate. The secondary outcomes included adverse events and cytogenetic risk in subgroup analyses. IA showed a statistically significant in CR (RR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.00-1.09, P = .03) and CR1 (RR = 1.11; 95%CI = 1.04-1.18, P = .003), but not in CR2 (RR = 0.97; 95%CI = 0.77-1.24, P = .83), and relapse rate (RR = 1.08; 95%CI = 0.98-1.43, P = .08). In high dose daunorubicin group, OS was significantly improved with IA compared to DA (HR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.8-1.0, P = .041, I = 0). At grade 3/4 adverse events, the difference between IA and DA was not statistically significant (infection, P = .28; cardiac toxicity, P = .15; bleeding, P = .29). In the subgroup analysis, the genotypes of the IA and DA groups were not statistically significant for comparison of CR between the two groups (P = .07). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that IA had a better efficacy in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia than DA, even with increased doses of DA. The OS of a standard dose of IA patients was longer than that of DA patients. Our research shows that anthracycline dose intensification of daunorubicin is of no clinically relevant benefit in AML patients comparing with a standard dose of IA. When it comes to adverse drug reactions, it is not a significant difference. Therefore, in clinical practice, IA should be the first choice for induction regimen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Wang, Hanyu', 'Xiao, Xueting', 'Xiao, Qirong', 'Lu, Yanhong', 'Wu, Yong']","['Wang H', 'Xiao X', 'Xiao Q', 'Lu Y', 'Wu Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC7302600,,,,2020/06/17 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000020094 [doi]', '00005792-202006120-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Jun 12;99(24):e20094. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000020094.,,24,,20200629,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Safety', 'Survival Analysis', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subject practiced a combat sport (Muay Thai), and 2 days before his last training, he was involved in a fight where the aggressor punched him in the face; however, after the fight, he did not claim of any symptoms. The current case highlights the importance of the role of the forensic pathologist because only through a careful and complete circumstantial, autoptic, and histological analysis it is possible to date the origin of a cerebral hemorrhage and establish whether it is spontaneous or posttraumatic in subjects with undiagnosed preexisting diseases. Through an integrated study, it is also important to date the lesion and identify the traumatic event responsible of the bleeding. Finally, this case has a relevant clinical importance relatively to sports medicine, where it would be appropriate that athletes undergo blood test as a preventive measure.

In the current era of next-generation sequencing-based genomic analysis, we can better identify patients with NS with more accurate AML-related prognostic markers. Germline mutations in PTPN11 are the most common cause of NS. Somatic mutations in NPM1 occur frequently in AML. Here, we describe a young adult patient with a novel combined germline PTPN11 and somatic NPM1, IDH1,and BCL6 mutations who presented with fatal AML. In addition, a 50.5-Mb interstitial deletion of 7q21.11-q33 in tumor DNA was detected by chromosomal microarray analysis. While mutations in the transcriptional repressor BCL6 are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), its novel identification in this patient suggests an expanded role in aggressive AML. The identification of key molecular aberrations including the overexpression of SHP2, which drives leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis, has led to the development of novel investigational targeted SHP2 inhibitors.","['(c) 2020 S.

With small cohorts of KS2 patients, it is not clear whether differences exist in clinical manifestations relative to KS1. We mutated KMT2D in neural crest cells (NCCs) to study cellular and molecular functions in craniofacial development with respect to UTX. Similar to UTX, KMT2D NCC knockout mice demonstrate hypoplasia with reductions in frontonasal bone lengths. We have traced the onset of KMT2D and UTX mutant NCC frontal dysfunction to a stage of altered osteochondral progenitor differentiation. KMT2D NCC loss-of-function does exhibit unique phenotypes distinct from UTX mutation, including fully penetrant cleft palate, mandible hypoplasia and deficits in cranial base ossification. KMT2D mutant NCCs lead to defective secondary palatal shelf elevation with reduced expression of extracellular matrix components. KMT2D mutant chondrocytes in the cranial base fail to properly differentiate, leading to defective endochondral ossification. We conclude that KMT2D is required for appropriate cranial NCC differentiation and KMT2D-specific phenotypes may underlie differences between Kabuki syndrome subtypes.",['(c) 2020.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) holds promise as a new agent that also could be efficacious in newly diagnosed AML with acceptable toxicity. This paper describes the design of a protocol to conduct a systematic review of published studies assessing GO for the treatment of AML. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials that investigate the effect and safety of GO for the treatment of patients with AML. We will search for any eligible articles from selected electronic databases. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis for study selection and reporting. We will use The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Meta-Analysis as guidance to select eligible studies. All data will be extracted using a standardised data extraction form. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There was no patient involved in this study, therefore no ethical consideration is needed. The findings of this study will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and any relevant conference presentation.

This study was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of CP55940 on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on T-ALL cells (Jurkat). PBL and Jurkat cells were treated with CP55940 (0-20 muM), and morphological changes in the cell nucleus/ DNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Cellular apoptosis markers were also evaluated by western blotting, pharmacological inhibition and immunofluorescence. CP55940 induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells, but not in PBL, in a dose-response manner with increasing fragmentation of DNA, arrest of cell cycle and damage of DeltaPsim. CP55940 increased dichlorofluorescein fluorescence (DCF) intensity, increased DJ-1 Cys(106)- sulfonate, a marker of intracellular stress, induced the up-regulation of p53 and phosphorylation of transcription factor c-JUN. It increased the expression of BAX and PUMA, up-regulated mitochondrial proteins PINK1 and Parkin, and activated CASPASE-3. Antioxidant NAC, pifithrin-alpha, and SP600125 blocked CP55940 deleterious effect on Jurkat cells. However, the potent and highly specific cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor inverse agonist SR141716 and SR144528 were unable to blunt CP55940-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Conclusively CP55940 provokes cell death in Jurkat through CBR-independent mechanism. Interestingly, CP55940 was also cytotoxic to ex vivo T-ALL cells from chemotherapy-resistant pediatric patients. In conclusion, CP55940 selectively induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells through a H2O2-mediated signaling pathway.

Deregulated UPR signaling, which often occurs in hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia, defines the degree of cellular toxicity and perturbs protein homeostasis, and at the same time, offers a novel therapeutic target.

Other types of HT are very rare, and their incidence, histopathology, and patient outcomes have not been sufficiently described. Here, we assessed the clinicopathological characteristics of 19 cases of non-DLBCL HT of FL in a single institution in Japan to advance the understanding of the disease. Among 889 consecutive patients diagnosed with FL between 2000 and 2018, 191 suffered HT (21%). The median follow-up period was 94 months (range = 3-225). A total of 172 patients (90%) had DLBCL transformation, whereas the remaining 19 patients (10%) exhibited non-DLBCL transformation. In the latter cases, the following diagnoses were made based on morphology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses: classic Hodgkin lymphoma (7 patients; 4%); high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (4 patients; 2%); HGBL, not otherwise specified (4 patients; 2%); B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (2 patients; 1%); anaplastic large-cell lymphoma-like lymphoma (1 patient; 0.5%); and plasmablastic lymphoma (1 patient; 0.5%). Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA-1 did not associate with HT in any of the cases tested (n = 8). Patients with non-DLBCL transformation showed poor outcomes, with a median overall survival of 13 months (range = 2 days-107 months); 10 of the patients (53%) died of HT. In conclusions, non-DLBCL transformation was observed in 10% of patients with HT from FL.

However, relapse is still the main factor affecting survival. We aimed to investigate the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) on reducing recurrence and improving the survival of high-risk pediatric t(8;21) AML based on minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided treatment, and to further explore the prognostic factors to guide risk stratification treatment and identify who will benefit from allo-HSCT. METHODS: Overall, 129 newly diagnosed pediatric t(8;21) AML patients were included in this study. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk group according to RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels after 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy. High-risk patients were divided into HSCT group and chemotherapy group according to their treatment choices. The characteristics and outcomes of 125 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: For high-risk patients, allo-HSCT could improve 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate compared to chemotherapy (87.4% vs. 61.9%; P = 0.026). Five-year overall survival (OS) rate in high-risk HSCT group had a trend for better than that in high-risk chemotherapy group (82.8% vs. 71.4%; P = 0.260). The 5-year RFS rate of patients with a c-KIT mutation in high-risk HSCT group had a trend for better than that of patients with a c-KIT mutation in high-risk chemotherapy group (82.9% vs. 75%; P = 0.400). Extramedullary infiltration (EI) at diagnosis was associated with a high cumulative incidence of relapse for high-risk patients (50% vs. 18.4%; P = 0.004); allo-HSCT can improve the RFS (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: allo-HSCT can improve the prognosis of high-risk pediatric t(8;21) AML based on MRD-guided treatment. Patients with a c-KIT mutation may benefit from allo-HSCT. EI is an independent prognostic factor for high-risk patients and allo-HSCT can improve the prognosis.",,"['Hu, Guan-Hua', 'Cheng, Yi-Fei', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Yan, Chen-Hua',

However, there are some transplantation-related risks. Predicting the risk-benefit ratio prior to AHSCT facilitates the choice of conditioning regimens and posttransplant follow-up. Hence, many risk models have been developed. The aim of the present study was to compare 6 different risk models that are clinically used. Materials and Methods: A total of 259 patients were enrolled in this study. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI), Age-Adjusted Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI-Age), revised Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (rPAM), Acute Leukemia-EBMT (AL-EBMT), and Disease Risk Index (DRI) risk models were applied retrospectively. Results: The AL-EBMT, HCT-CI, and HCT-CI-Age scoring systems were found to be predictive for 2-year overall survival (OS) and 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) (2-year OS: AL-EBMT, reference vs. score 8.5-10, HR: 1.3, p=0.035; AL-EBMT, reference vs. score >10, HR: 3.8, p=0.001; HCT-CI: reference vs. score 1-2, HR: 1.4, p=0.018; HCT-CI: reference vs. score >/=3, HR: 2.5, p<0.001; HCT-CI-Age: reference vs. score 1-2, HR: 1.3, p<0.001; HCT-CI-Age: reference vs. score >/=3, HR: 3.2, p<0.001) (2-year NRM: AL-EBMT: reference vs. score 8.5-10, HR: 1.61, p<0.001; AL-EBMT: reference vs. score >10, HR: 3.3, p<0.001; HCT-CI: reference vs. score 1-2, HR: 1.3, p=0.028; HCT-CI: reference vs. score >/=3, HR: 2.3, p=0.011; HCT-CI-Age: reference vs. score 1-2, HR: 1.3, p=0.01; HCT-CI-Age: reference vs. score >/=3, HR: 2.4, p=0.003). In terms of the Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2-year OS and 2-year NRM, the risk scoring system with the highest predictive power was found to be AL-EBMT (2-year AUC: 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). The other scores were not found to be predictive for 2-year OS and NRM. Conclusion: In the present study at our bone marrow and stem cell transplant center, it has been demonstrated that the HCT-CI, HCT-CI-Age, and AL-EBMT are good predictors of 2-year NRM and OS.",,"['Aladag, Elifcan', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Goker, Hakan']","['Aladag E', 'Demiroglu H', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Goker H']","['Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200616,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,PMC8171207,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Risk scoring', '*Acute leukemia']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/11/17 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2020.0178 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2021 Jun 1;38(2):138-144. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2020.0178.

Keloid fibroblasts were treated with luteolin at different concentrations. MTT method, western blot, flow cytometry, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used to detect cell proliferation, cyclin D1 (CyclinD1), p21, B-cell lymphoma / leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 related X protein (Bax), FRAT1 protein expression, apoptosis and ARHI mRNA expression. Keloid fibroblasts were transfected with si-FRAT1, or pcDNA-FRAT1 and treated with luteolin to observe their roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Compared with the control group, luteolin significantly reduced the keloid fibroblast activity, CyclinD1, Bcl-2, and FRAT1 protein levels, and obviously improved the cell apoptosis rate, p21 and Bax protein expression (P&lt;0.05). The expression of FRAT1 mRNA and protein in keloid fibroblasts was greatly increased (P&lt;0.05). Inhibition of FRAT1 expression evidently decreased cell viability at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, CyclinD1, and Bcl-2 protein expression of keloid fibroblasts, while-dramatically enhanced cell apoptosis, p21, and Bax protein levels (P&lt;0.05).

Paris Saponin VII (PS), a saponin which was isolated from the roots of Trillium kamtschaticum, from our group, was reported to provide hemostatic, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. However, its molecular mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effects remains unclear. Thus, this study hypothesized to assess that mechanism in PS treated HEL cells. METHODS: The MTT assay was used to analyze the PS inhibited cell viability in the HEL cells. We further found that PS could induce S phase cell cycle arrest through flow cytometry as well as the western blot analysis of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic molecules. RESULTS: The MTT assay showed the IC50 concentration of PS as 0.667muM. The study revealed that PS treatment inhibits cell proliferation dose-dependently. It further caused mitochondrial membrane potential changes by PS treatment. Mechanistic protein expression revealed a dose-dependent upsurge for Bid and Bim molecules, while Bcl2 and PARP expression levels were significantly (P<0.05) down-regulated in PS treated HEL cells resulting in caspase -3 release and increased the Bim levels upon 24h of incubation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that PS possesses an excellent anti-leukemic activity via the regulation of the mitochondrial pathway, leading to S phase cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis, suggesting it as a potential alternative chemotherapeutic agent for leukemia patients.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Lin, Xin', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Varier, Krishnapriya M', 'Liu, Wuling', 'Song, Jingrui', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Chunlin', 'Qiu, Jianfei', 'Ni, Wei', 'Qin, XuJie', 'Wen, Min', 'Liu, Haiyang', 'Li, Yanmei']","['Lin X', 'Gajendran B', 'Varier KM', 'Liu W', 'Song J', 'Rao Q', 'Wang C', 'Qiu J', 'Ni W', 'Qin X', 'Wen M', 'Liu H', 'Li Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Dr. ALM PGIBMS, University of Madras, Taramani Campus, Chennai, Tamilnadu-600113, India.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, and Yunnan Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, and Yunnan Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China.', 'College of Basic Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, and Yunnan Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou Province- 550014, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HEL', '*Leukemia', '*Paris Saponin VII', '*apoptosis', '*cell cycle', '*membrane signaling pathway']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2020/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-107359 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200615134039 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2021;21(4):498-507. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200615134039.,,4,,20211019,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Paris saponin VII)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Saponins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Saponins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression level and clinical value of microRNA-409-3p in acute myeloid leukemia has not yet been systematically studied. METHODS: We collected 88 bone marrow samples derived from 73 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 15 healthy controls. Then we evaluated the expression of microRNA-409-3p by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The results revealed that compared with the healthy controls, microRNA-409-3p expression in a newly diagnosed group was significantly lower (p < 0.001). In addition, the microRNA-409-3p expression in the complete remission group was strikingly higher compared to that of the newly diagnosed group (p < 0.001). There was a correlation between microRNA-409-3p expression and white blood cells (p = 0.021). Most importantly, the micro-RNA-409-3p low expression group indicated a shorter event-free survival compared with microRNA-409-3p high expression group by using Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.0438).

Further study showed that the level of serum miR-145 was much lower in AML patients with initial WBC count >/= 50 x 109/L than that of WBC count < 50 x 109/L. Moreover, the level of serum miR-145 in prednisone poor responders was significantly lower than that in prednisone good responders. Compared with minimal residual disease (MRD) < 0.01% group, serum miR-145 was much lower in AML patients with MRD >/= 0.01% group. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that serum miR-145 was positively correlated with MRD. In addition, miR-145 diagnosed AML with an AUC of 0.915 (95% confidence interval: 0.828 to 1.000; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The level of miR-145 in serum and BMNc of AML patients was significantly lower than those of the control group. Serum miR-145 was related to poor prognosis and disease recurrence of AML.",,"['Shi, Qingfen', 'Xing, Guanqun', 'Qi, Min', 'Xing, Youzhong']","['Shi Q', 'Xing G', 'Qi M', 'Xing Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,,,,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.191143 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Jun 1;66(6). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.191143.,,6,,20210413,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN145 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation (TBI/Cy) or plus busulfan (Bu/Cy) is a widely used pre-transplant conditioning regimen for ALL. We retrospectively compared the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and other transplant outcomes of allo-HSCT in 119 adult patients with ALL who received an HLA-matched sibling allo-HSCT using TBI-based versus non-TBI-based conditioning regimens. Patients were divided into two groups by their conditioning regimen: TBI/Cy or Bu/Cy. RESULTS: Median OS was 11 months in the TBI/Cy group and 6.2 months in the Bu/Cy group. Median DFS was 11.1 months in the TBI group versus 6.8 months in the Bu group, without a statistically significant difference. A higher risk of relapse was observed with the Bu/Cy regimen (HR 2.709, CI 95% 1.106 to 6.638, p = 0.029). Patients who received a transplant in >/= CR2 were associated with poor DFS. CONCLUSION: Despite the high relapse rate in the non-TBI regimen (Bu/Cy), both regimens had no statistically significant differences in OS, DFS, and NRM. Additional prospective studies are indeed warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of radiation-free regimens, including oral and intravenous busulfan, and compare these regimens with TBI-based ones.",,"['Abdelaty, Mona Mahrous', 'Gawaly, Amr', 'Fathy, Gamal M', 'Kabbash, Ibrahim', 'Taha, Atef']","['Abdelaty MM', 'Gawaly A', 'Fathy GM', 'Kabbash I', 'Taha A']","['Internal Medicine Department, Hematology/Bone marrow transplantation unit, Tanta University, Tanta, Algharbia, Egypt. drmona70@yahoo.com.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Hematology/Bone marrow transplantation unit, Tanta University, Tanta, Algharbia, Egypt.', 'Nasser Institute Hospital for Research and Treatment, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Public Health and Community Medicine Department, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Hematology/Bone marrow transplantation unit, Tanta University, Tanta, Algharbia, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200615,England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Busulfan', 'Conditioning', 'Total body irradiation']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s43046-020-00042-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s43046-020-00042-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2020 Jun 15;32(1):28. doi: 10.1186/s43046-020-00042-4.,,1,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9069-8147'],20210524,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma has also raised significant safety concerns in recent years. Methods: A systematic search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was performed to identify all cases of breast implant-associated deaths reported to the FDA. Results: The search identified 50 reported cases of apparent implant-related mortality; breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma comprised the majority of fatal outcomes (n = 21, 42%), followed by lymphoma (n = 4, 8%), breast cancer (n = 3, 6%), pancreatic cancer (n = 2, 4%), implant rupture (n = 2, 4%), and postoperative infections (n = 2, 4%). Single cases (n = 1, 2% each) of leukemia, small bowel cancer, lung disease, pneumonia, autoimmune and joint disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, liver failure, and sudden death, and 2 cases (4%) of newborn deaths, to mothers with breast implants, were also identified. A literature review demonstrated that 54% of alleged implant-related deaths were not truly associated with breast implant use: the majority of these reports (82%) originated from the public and third-party sources, rather than evidence-based reports by health-care professionals and journal articles. Conclusions: Although there exists a need for more comprehensive reporting in federal databases, the information available should be considered for a more complete understanding of implant-associated adverse outcomes. With only 46% of FDA-reported implant-related deaths demonstrated to be truly associated with breast implant use, there exists a need for public awareness and education on breast implant safety.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

However, its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been sufficiently analyzed. Methods: We investigated LOX plasma expression in 683 AML patients (age 17-60 years) treated within the prospective AML2003 trial (NCT00180102). The optimal cut-off LOX value was determined using a minimal-p-value method dichotomizing patients into a LOX-high group (> 109 ng/mL, n = 272, 40%) and a LOX-low group (</= 109 ng/mL, n = 411, 60%). Results: Higher LOX expression was associated with lower peripheral white blood cells, lower serum LDH, and a lower frequency of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations at diagnosis. Higher LOX expression was found significantly more frequently in patients with secondary AML and therapy-related AML, in patients with French-American-British M5 subtypes, and in patients with adverse-risk cytogenetics. Comparing patients in the LOX-high group and the LOX-low group revealed a 3-year overall survival (OS) of 47 and 53% (p = 0.022) and 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of 27 and 35% (p = 0.005), respectively. In the LOX-high group significantly more patients had extramedullary AML compared to the LOX-low group (p = 0.037). Combining extramedullary AML and LOX as interacting factors in a multivariate analysis resulted in an independent impact on survival for the LOX-high-extramedullary interaction for OS (HR = 2.25, p = 0.025) and EFS (HR = 2.48, p = 0.008). Furthermore, in patients with extramedullary disease (n = 59) the LOX level predicted survival. Patients within the LOX-low group had an OS of 43% and EFS of 36% as compared to the LOX-high group with an OS of 13% and EFS of 6% (p = 0.002 and p = 0.008, respectively). Conclusion: We hypothesize LOX expression to be a new potential biomarker to predict outcome in AML, specifically in AML subgroups such as the prognostic heterogeneous group of AML patients with extramedullary disease. Trial registration: This retrospective study was performed with patient samples registered within the prospective AML2003 trial (NCT00180102).

This graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect is mediated by alloreactive donor T-cells against recipient malignant cells. Unfortunately, graft versus host disease is a potentially lethal complication of this procedure, also mediated by alloreactive donor T-cells against recipient normal tissues. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a key contributor to nonrelapse mortality and long-term morbidity in patients undergoing allo-HCT. Reducing GVHD without interfering with - or ideally while enhancing - GvL, would improve outcomes and increase patient eligibility for allo-HCT. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway acts downstream of over 50 cytokines and is central to a wide variety of inflammatory pathways. These pathways play a role in the development and maintenance of GVHD throughout the disease process and within T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells. Agents targeting JAK/STAT signaling pathways have shown clinical efficacy and gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for numerous diseases.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SPAG6 is upregulated in bone marrow from patients with MDS and MDS-transformed acute myeloid leukemia and that knockdown of SPAG6 expression levels suppressed proliferation and promote apoptosis and differentiation in SKM-1 cells. However, the association between SPAG6 and autophagy in SKM-1 cells remains unclear. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate this association and its underlying mechanism. The present study used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus to silence SPAG6 expression levels in SKM-1 cells and demonstrated that SPAG6 knockdown increased autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologically inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine and 3-methyladenine decreased SPAG6 knockdown-mediated apoptosis, indicating that SPAG6 knockdown-mediated autophagy promoted apoptosis in SKM-1 cells. Additionally, compared with the expression levels in negative control-shRNA lentivirus-transfected SKM-1 cells, the protein expression levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and phosphorylated unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (p-ULK1) were upregulated, while phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) protein expression was downregulated in SPAG6-shRNA lentivirus-transfected cells. Moreover, inhibiting AMPK expression levels with Compound C, a specific inhibitor of AMPK, attenuated SPAG6 knockdown-induced autophagy and apoptosis, suggesting that AMPK-mediated autophagy enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of SPAG6 knockdown in SKM-1 cells. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that SPAG6 silencing triggered autophagy via regulation of the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway, which further contributed to the apoptosis of SKM-1 cells induced by SPAG6 knockdown. Thus, the current results indicate that SPAG6 may be a potential therapeutic target against MDS, and that autophagy may represent a potential mechanism for the treatment of MDS.",['Copyright: (c) Zhang et al.'],"['Zhang, Meng', 'Luo, Jie', 'Luo, Xiaohua', 'Liu, Lin']","['Zhang M', 'Luo J', 'Luo X', 'Liu L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yuzhong, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

Two patients with advanced B-ALL were enrolled to receive a co-infusion of high-dose human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical donor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (GPBMCs; 21.01-25.34 x 10(8)/kg) and the same donor-derived CD19-targeted CART cells (8.44-22.19 x 10(6)/kg) without additional in vitro gene-editing following a reinduction chemotherapy as precondition. They achieved complete remission and full donor chimerism (FDC) with ongoing 20- and 4-month leukemia-free survival. A significant amplification of donor CART cells was detected in peripheral blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid and was associated with the formation of FDC. The highest amount of copies of the donor CART cells reached 4962 per microg of genomic DNA (gDNA) and 2449 per microg of gDNA, and the longest persistence was 20 months associated with B cell aplasia. Two patients experienced Grade II or III cytokine release syndromes and developed controllable Grade II intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or limited chronic oral GVHD.

For several decades, the diagnostic approach in AML was largely based on histologic characteristics with little impact on the treatment decision-making process. This perspective has drastically changed within the past years due to the advent of novel molecular technologies, such as whole genome next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the resulting knowledge gain in AML biology and pathogenesis. After more than four decades of intensive chemotherapy as a ""one-size-fits-all"" concept, several targeted agents have recently been approved for the treatment of AML, either as single agents or as part of combined treatment regimens. Several other compounds, directed against regulators of apoptotic, epigenetic, or microenvironmental pathways, as well as modulators of the immune system, are currently in development and being investigated in clinical trials. The constant progress in AML research has started to produce improved survival rates and fueled hopes that a once rapidly fatal disease can be transformed into a chronic condition.

This highlights an opportunity to develop improved relapse-prediction models for MR patients. We hypothesised that bone marrow from MR patients who eventually relapsed would regrow faster in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after induction chemotherapy than samples from patients in long-term remission. METHODS: Diagnostic bone marrow aspirates from 30 paediatric MR-ALL patients (19 who relapsed, 11 who experienced remission) were inoculated into immune-deficient (NSG) mice and subsequently treated with either control or an induction-type regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase (VXL). Engraftment was monitored by enumeration of the proportion of human CD45(+) cells (%huCD45(+)) in the murine peripheral blood, and events were defined a priori as the time to reach 1% huCD45(+), 25% huCD45(+) (TT25%) or clinical manifestations of leukaemia (TTL). RESULTS: The TT25% value significantly predicted MR patient relapse. Mutational profiles of PDXs matched their tumours of origin, with a clonal shift towards relapse observed in one set of VXL-treated PDXs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, establishing PDXs at diagnosis and subsequently applying chemotherapy has the potential to improve relapse prediction in paediatric MR-ALL.",,"['Alruwetei, Abdulmohsen M', 'Bendak, Katerina', 'Yadav, Babasaheb D', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Alruwetei AM', 'Bendak K', 'Yadav BD', 'Carol H', 'Evans K', 'Mayoh C', 'Sutton R', 'Marshall GM', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'College of Applied Medical Science, Medical Laboratory Department, Qassim University, Qassim, Saudi Arabia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. rlock@ccia.unsw.edu.au.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200615,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC7462974,,,,2020/06/17 06:00,2021/04/01 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0933-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0933-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 Sep;123(5):742-751. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0933-4.

Methods: An improved advanced fragment analysis (iAFA) technique was developed to detect 57 marker genes in 264 pediatric ALL patients treated in Beijing Children's Hospital from August 2016 to June 2019. The 56 ALL patients with ETV6-RUNX1 positive were evaluated by clinical characteristics in gene expression profile, immunophenotype and early response of chemotherapy in different clusters. Results: The 56 ETV6-RUNX1-positive patients were clustered into 2 groups of E/R-1 (45, 80.4%) and E/R-2 (11, 19.6%) . Spearman coefficient was 0.788 and 0.901 in E/R-2 and E/R-1, respectively. The median of initial platelet counts was 104 (27-644) and 50 (8-390) (P<0.01) in E/R-2 and E/R-1, respectively. The median of proportion of initial bone marrow immature cells was 0.830 (0.270-0.975) and 0.935 (0.445-0.990) (P<0.05) in E/R-2 and E/R-1, respectively.

Methods: Basic information and clinical data of patients with T-LBL treated in the hematologic center of Tangdu Hospital from January 2013 to January 2017 were collected, and the patients who achieved CR/PR were included in this study and retrospectively analyzed. Results: 1 in circleA total of 48 patients received pediatric-like ALL chemotherapy, among which 39 patients achieved CR and 9 patients achieved PR after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy. Auto-HSCT was performed in 14 cases and allo-HSCT in 7 cases, and the hematopoietic function of all 21 patients was successfully reconstructed after transplantation. 2 in circleThe follow-up period was 9-61 months, with a median of 31 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 61.0% (95% CI 53.7%-68.3%) , and the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 54.8% (95% CI 47.1%-62.2%) . 3 in circleThe 3-year OS rate of transplantation group was 84.7%, and that of non-transplantation group was 42.8%. Significant difference of OS rate was observed between the 2 groups (P=0.006) . The 3-year PFS rate was 75.4% in transplantation group and 38.9% in non-transplantation group. Significant difference of the PFS rate between the two groups was observed (P=0.004) . 4 in circleNo difference of OS rate between auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT groups was observed (P=0.320) , same as the PFS rate (P=0.597) . Among the prognostic factors, bone marrow invasion and no HSCT are independent risk factors affecting the long-term prognosis of patients. The mortality rate of patients with bone marrow invasion is about 5.804 times higher than that of patients without bone marrow invasion, and the mortality rate of patients with HSCT is about 5.871 times higher than that of patients without HSCT. Conclusion: T-LBL received pediatric-like ALL chemotherapy and HSCT has definite curative effect with lower transplant-related mortality and more safety. In the transplantation group, there is no significant difference of OS and PFS rates between patients receiving auto-HSCT and patients receiving allo-HSCT. Moreover, bone marrow invasion and no HSCT are both independent risk factors for long-term prognosis of patients.",,"['Wang, H T', 'Dong, Y', 'Gao, X T', 'Wan, Z', 'Zhao, Y X', 'Liu, Y M', 'Liu, L']","['Wang HT', 'Dong Y', 'Gao XT', 'Wan Z', 'Zhao YX', 'Liu YM', 'Liu L']","[""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China."", ""Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7342060,['NOTNLM'],"['Antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'T-lymphoblastic lymphoma']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.05.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 May 14;41(5):387-393. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.05.005.,"['31573244/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018ZDXM-SF-063/Key Projects of Shaanxi Province']",5,,20200812,,IM,"['Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of 78 adult patients with Ph(+) ALL who underwent auto-HSCT (n=31) and MSD-HSCT (n=47) in Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, from January 2008 to December 2017. The overall survival (OS) rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rate, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate, and the impact of achievement of complete molecular response (CMR) within 3 months and sustaining CMR up to transplantation (s3CMR) on transplantation method were explored. Results: The median time of neutrophil and platelet reconstitution in auto-HSCT and MSD-HSCT groups were 12 (10-29) days vs14 (11-24) days (P=0.006) and 17.5 (10-62) days vs 7 (10-33) days (P=0.794) , respectively. In the MSD-HSCT group, the incidence of - and - acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 27.7% (13/47) and 8.5% (4/47) , respectively. The incidence of limited and extensive chronic GVHD was 17.0% (8/47) and 12.8% (6/47) , respectively. The estimated CIR, NRM, LFS, and OS at 3 years were not significantly different between auto-HSCT and MSD-HSCT groups (P>0.05) . For 44 patients who achieved s3CMR, 3-year OS[ (84.0+/-8.6) % vs (78.0+/-8.7) %, P=0.612], LFS[ (70.3+/-10.3) % vs (68.2+/-10.1) %, P=0.970], CIR[ (24.9+/-10.0) % vs (14.4+/-8.0) %, P=0.286], and NRM[ (4.7+/-4.7) % vs (17.4+/-8.1) %, P=0.209] of the auto-HSCT and MSD-HSCT groups were not significantly different. However, for 34 patients who did not reach s3CMR, 3-year cumulative relapse rate of patients in the auto-HSCT group was significantly higher than MSD-HSCT group[ (80.0+/-14.7) % vs (39.6+/-10.9) %, P=0.057]. Conclusions: auto-HSCT with maintenance therapy after HSCT appears to be an attractive treatment option for patients with Ph(+) ALL especially for those with s3CMR maintained up to transplantation.

Methods: In this retrospective investigation, we studied adults with primary AML who received auto-HSCT and URD-HSCT from March 2008 to November 2018. Overall survival (OS) , leukemia-free survival (LFS) , relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM) , and hematopoietic reconstitution were compared along with the prognostic value of cytogenetics. Results: A total of 147 adult patients were enrolled in this study (n=87 for auto-HSCT and n=60 for URD-HSCT) . Baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. The accumulative neutrophil engraftment rate at +30 days was not statistically different between the 2 groups[92.6% (95% CI 86.9%-98.3%) vs 98.3% (95% CI 95.0%-100.0%) , P=0.270], whereas the accumulative platelet engraftment rate at +60 days was significantly lower in the auto-HSCT group[83.6% (95% CI 75.8%-91.4%) vs 93.3% (95% CI 87.0%-99.6%) , P<0.001]. In patients undergoing URD-HSCT, the accumulative incidences of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and grade - aGVHD were 56.7% (95% CI 43.0%-68.2%) and 16.7% (95% CI 8.5%-27.2%) , and the incidences of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and extensive cGVHD were 33.3% (95% CI 21.7%-45.4%) and 15.0% (95% CI 7.3%-25.2%) , respectively. After a median follow-up of 53.8 (0.8-127.8) months, patients in the 2 groups demonstrated comparable OS and LFS at 5 years after transplant[71.7% (95% CI 61.7%-81.7%) vs 67.8% (95% CI 55.8%-79.8%) , P=0.556; 64.6% (95% CI 54.4%-74.8%) vs 68.1% (95% CI 56.3%-79.9%) , P=0.642]. Patients in the auto-HSCT group showed significantly higher incidence of relapse at 5 years after transplant[31.9% (95% CI 22.2%-42.1%) vs 15.1% (95% CI 7.4%-25.6%) , P=0.015] and significantly lower incidence of TRM[3.4% (95% CI 0.9%-8.9%) vs 16.7% (95% CI 8.5%-27.2%) , P=0.006] compared with the URD group. HLA mismatching had no effects on the incidences of hematopoietic reconstitution, GVHD, OS, LFS, relapse, and TRM. Patients of cytogenetically favorable and intermediate risk demonstrated comparable OS and LFS after auto-HSCT and URD-HSCT, while patients of poor risk had significantly higher relapse and lower LFS after auto-HSCT. Conclusions: In this study, adults with primary AML in CR(1) demonstrated relatively higher relapse but lower TRM after auto-HSCT, resulting in comparable survival to that of URD-HSCT. In the absence of matched sibling donors, patients of cytogenetically poor risk should receive URD-HSCT in order to achieve lower relapse and better survival.",,"['Yao, J F', 'Zhang, G X', 'Yang, D L', 'He, Y', 'Wei, J L', 'Zhai, W H', 'Jiang, E L', 'Zhang, R L', 'Feng, S Z', 'Han, M Z']","['Yao JF', 'Zhang GX', 'Yang DL', 'He Y', 'Wei JL', 'Zhai WH', 'Jiang EL', 'Zhang RL', 'Feng SZ', 'Han MZ']","['National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7342061,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Autologous stem cell transplantation', 'Cytogenetics', 'Unrelated donor stem cell transplantation']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.05.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 May 14;41(5):365-372. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.05.002.,"['81670171, 81700166, 81700115/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81900182/National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China', '18JCZDJC34400/Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced', 'Technology', '2016-I2M-3-023/CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences']",5,,20200812,,IM,"['Adult', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This was a retrospective study. The clinical data of four cases of HSTCL gammadelta type who were treated in Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital from 2009 to 2014 were collected. Their initial morphology diagnoses in other hospitals were all acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Morphological analysis and cytochemical stains to their bone marrow (BM) aspiration and peripheral blood (PB) smears were completed when they had no response to previous chemotherapies, and the morphological reports were compared with results of immunophenotyping, chromosome, and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. Results: The percentages of malignant cells in four patients' BM aspirations were 7.6%-40.0%, and in two patients' PB was 9% and 10%, respectively. The morphology of four cases had a very high similarity in Wright's stain. Predominantly medium-sized cells were seen, with rich cytoplasm and frequently one big conspicuous nucleolus. The malignant cells resembled blasts, especially monoblasts, but with coarse granular chromatin, more compact than that in monoblasts. When comparing to malignant myeloblast and lymphoblasts, HSTCL cells were larger and more irregular in cell shape, with more abundant cytoplasm and prominent nuclear irregularity. The cytochemistric stain played an important role in differential diagnosis. HSTCL malignant cells showed non-specific esterase (NSE) negative or focal punctate activity which couldn't be inhibited by sodium fluoride. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was negative or positive with a form of coarse granules. The myeloperioxdase (MPO) stain was negative. Conclusion: Malignant cells of HSTCL gammadelta type have very distinct morphological features of mature lymphocytic neoplasm. The quality of Wright's stain, being short of complete cytochemical stains, lacking of awareness of this disease, and acute leukemia or MDS like appearance in some cases, result in the possibility of diagnostic error as malignant blast, and probably are main causes of misdiagnosis of HSTCL gammadelta type.",,"['Wu, P', 'Sun, H P', 'Wan, L J', 'Zhou, C Y', 'Wang, T', 'Liu, H X', 'Wang, H']","['Wu P', 'Sun HP', 'Wan LJ', 'Zhou CY', 'Wang T', 'Liu HX', 'Wang H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital, Sanhe 065201, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diagnostic errors', 'Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,2020/06/17 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2020/06/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200221-00382 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun 16;100(23):1805-1811. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200221-00382.,,23,,20200810,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Liver Neoplasms', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenic Neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that IgG can be expressed in myeloblasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and plays a role in the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells. However, its clinical impact has not been assessed. METHODS: We assessed the expression of different classes of immunoglobulin in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 132 AML patients and correlated the levels of expression with clinicopathologic and molecular genetic features, as well as clinical outcome. RESULTS: We found that, in addition to IgG, all classes of immunoglobulin are expressed in myeloblasts, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, Igkappa, and Iglambda. The levels of IgG expression (coupled with Igkappa or Iglambda) are higher than those of IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we identified two distinct groups of AML patients with differential expression of immunoglobulin and different clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of immunoglobulin expression are associated with monocytic differentiation, multilineage dysplasia, TET2 and KRAS mutations, and poor overall survival.

Due to sample size constraints we pooled incidence among regional groups based on countries of origin: East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), Southeast (SE) Asians (Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian), Asian Indian/Pakistani, Oceanians (Guamanian, Samoan, Tongan) and Filipinos. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated comparing each API regional group to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and East Asians. Finally, we calculated the correlation between incidence of cancer in specific API ethnicities in SEER and in originating countries in the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Incidence rates among API regional groups varied. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was lower in children of SE Asian descent (IRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44, 0.96) compared to NHW. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was more common among children from Oceania compared to NHW (IRR 3.88, 95% CI 1.83, 8.22). East Asians had higher incidence rates than SE Asians but lower rates compared to children from Oceania. Correlation of some incidence rates between US-based API ethnicities and originating countries were similar.

Wnt signaling aberration has been linked with various disease conditions like osteoporosis, colon cancer, hair follicle tumor, Leukemia, and Alzheimer's disease. Phytochemicals like flavonoid, glycosides, polyphenols, have been reported to directly target the markers of Wnt signaling in different disease models. PURPOSE: The study deals in detail about the different phytochemical targeting key players of Wnt signaling pathway in diseases like Cancer, Osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease. We have focused on the Pharmacological basis of disease alleviation by phytochemical specifically targeting the Wnt signaling markers in this study. METHODS: The study focused on the published articles from the preclinical rodent and invitro cell line studies related to Wnt signaling and Phytochemicals related to Cancer, Alzheimer's and Osteoporosis. The electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science and Pubmed database were used for the systematic search of literatures from 2005 up to 2019 using keywords Canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Osteoporosis, Phytochemicals. The focus was to identify the target specific modulation of Wnt signaling mediated by phytochemicals. RESULTS: Approximately 30 phytochemicals of different class have been identified to modulate Wnt signaling pathway acting through Axin, beta-catenin translocation, GSK-3beta, AKT, Wif-1 in various experimental studies. The down regulation of Wnt signaling is observed in Cancer mostly colorectal cancer, breast cancer mediated through mutations in APC and Axin genes. Different class of Phytochemicals such as flavonoid, glycosides, polyphenol, alkaloids etc. have been found to target Wnt signaling markers and alleviate Cancer. Similarly, Up regulation of Wnt signaling has been reported in Osteoporosis and neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the possibility of the Phytochemicals to target Wnt markers and its potential to either activate or deactivate the Wnt signaling pathway. It also describes the challenges in proper targeting of Wnt signaling and the potential risk and consequences of either up regulation or down regulation of the signaling pathway. This article highlights the possibility of Wnt signaling pathway as a therapeutic option in different diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier GmbH.

ATPR, a novel all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) derivative, has been extensively developed to show superior anticancer effect than ATRA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, whether ferroptosis exists during ATPR treatment of AML remains unclear. Herein, we found that ferroptosis occurred in an AML xenograft mouse model of ATPR treatment. In vitro, ATPR was verified to induce ferroptosis in a dose-dependent manner by proferroptotic protein marker, lipid peroxidation, and lipid ROS, which could be significantly reversed by ferrostatin-1. Using lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine and iron chelator desferrioxamine, we further revealed that ATPR-induced ferroptosis was regulated by autophagy via iron homeostasis, especially Nrf2. Furthermore, targeting ferroptosis contributes to ATPR-induced AML differentiation. In conclusion, these results indicated that ferroptosis play an important role in ATPR-induced differentiation, and suggested that ATPR would provide a potential therapeutic value for AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

The standard of care for MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemias has remained largely unchanged for the past 50 years despite unsatisfying clinical outcomes, so there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that a vast number of epigenetic regulators are directly or indirectly involved in MLL-r leukemia, and they are responsible for supporting the aberrant gene expression program mediated by MLL-fusions. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications can be reversed by pharmacologic targeting of the responsible epigenetic regulators. This leads to significant interest in developing epigenetic therapies for MLL-r leukemia. Intriguingly, many of the epigenetic enzymes also involve in DNA damage response (DDR), which can be potential targets for synthetic lethality-induced therapies. In this review, we will summarize some of the recent advances in the development of epigenetic and DDR therapeutics by targeting epigenetic regulators or protein complexes that mediate MLL-r leukemia gene expression program and key players in DDR that safeguard essential genome integrity. The rationale and molecular mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic effects will also be discussed with a focus on how these treatments can disrupt MLL-fusion mediated transcriptional programs and impair DDR, which may help overcome treatment resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

By introducing a negative charge, deamidation could potentially impact the binding interface and biological activities of protein therapeutics. We identified a deamidation variant in moxetumomab pasudotox, an immunotoxin Fv fusion protein drug derived from a 38-kDa truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) for the treatment of hairy-cell leukemia. Although the deamidation site, Asn-358, was outside of the binding interface, the modification had a significant impact on the biological activity of moxetumomab pasudotox. Surprisingly, the variant eluted earlier than its unmodified form on anion exchange chromatography, which often leads to the conclusion that it has a higher positive charge. Here we describe the characterization of the deamidation variant with differential scanning calorimetry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, which revealed that the Asn-358 deamidation caused the conformational changes in the catalytic domain of the PE38 region. These results provide an explanation for why the deamidation affected the biological activity of moxetumomab pasudotox and suggest the approach that can be used for process control to ensure product quality and process consistency.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Unfortunately, a common side effect in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment is neutropenia. To mitigate the risk of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, prophylactic treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is administered. Extensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling of myelosuppression during chemotherapy has suggested avenues for therapy optimization to mitigate this neutropenia. However, the issue of resonance, whereby neutrophil oscillations are induced by the periodic administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy and the coadministration of G-CSF, potentially aggravating a patient's neutropenic/neutrophilic status, is not well-characterized in the clinical literature. Here, through analysis of neutrophil data from young acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients, we find that resonance is occurring during cyclic chemotherapy treatment in 26% of these patients. Motivated by these data and our previous modelling studies on adult lymphoma patients, we examined resonance during treatment with or without G-CSF. Using our quantitative systems pharmacology model of granulopoiesis, we show that the timing of cyclic chemotherapy can worsen neutropenia or neutrophilia, and suggest clinically-actionable schedules to reduce the resonant effect. We emphasize that delaying supportive G-CSF therapy to 6-7 days after chemotherapy can mitigate myelosuppressive effects. This study therefore highlights the importance of quantitative systems pharmacology for the clinical practice for developing rational therapeutic strategies.",['(c) 2020 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Mackey, Michael C', 'Glisovic, Sanja', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Pastore, Yves', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Craig, Morgan']","['Mackey MC', 'Glisovic S', 'Leclerc JM', 'Pastore Y', 'Krajinovic M', 'Craig M']","['Department of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200630,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy scheduling', '*chemotherapy-induced neutropenia', '*cytotoxic chemotherapy', '*quantitative systems pharmacology']",,2020/06/14 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14424 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2021 Feb;87(2):687-693. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14424.

DD primarily manifests as a severe cardiomyopathy. An early diagnosis is crucial for patient survival. The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of ocular examination for identification of DD. METHODS: Detailed ocular examination in 10 patients with DD (3 males, 7 females) and a 45-year-old asymptomatic female somatic mosaic carrier of a LAMP2 disease-causing variant. RESULTS: All patients with manifest cardiomyopathy had pigmentary retinopathy with altered autofluorescence and diffuse visual field loss. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was decreased (<0.63) in 8 (40%) out of 20 eyes. The severity of retinal pathology increased with age, resulting in marked cone-rod involvement overtime. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in younger patients revealed focal loss of photoreceptors, disruption and deposition at the retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane layer (corresponding to areas of marked increased autofluorescence), and hyperreflective foci in the outer nuclear layer. Cystoid macular oedema was seen in one eye. In the asymptomatic female with somatic mosaicism, the BCVA was 1.0 bilaterally. An abnormal autofluorescence pattern in the left eye was present; while full-field electroretinography was normal. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed ocular examination may represent a sensitive and quick screening tool for the identification of carriers of LAMP2 pathogenic variants, even in somatic mosaicism. Hence, further investigation should be undertaken in all patients with pigmentary retinal dystrophy as it may be a sign of a life-threatening disease.","['(c) 2020 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

However, the European Commission officially placed Triton X-100 on the Annex XIV authorization list in 2017 because a degradation product of Triton X-100, 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenol (also known as 4-tert-octylphenol), is considered to have harmful endocrine disrupting activities. As a result, the use of Triton X-100 in the European Economic Area (EEA) would not be allowed unless an ECHA issued authorization was granted after the sunset date of January 4, 2021. This has prompted biopharmaceutical manufacturers to search for novel, environment-friendly alternative detergents for enveloped virus inactivation. In this study, we report the identification of such a novel detergent, Simulsol SL 11W. Simulsol SL 11W is an undecyl glycoside surfactant produced from glucose and C11 fatty alcohol. We report here that Simulsol SL 11W was able to effectively inactive enveloped viruses, such as xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMuLV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV). By using XMuLV as a representative enveloped virus, the influence of various parameters on the effectiveness of virus inactivation was evaluated. Virus inactivation by Simulsol SL 11W was effective across different clarified bioreactor harvests at broad concentrations, pH, and temperature ranges. Simulsol SL 11W concentration, temperature of inactivation, and treatment time were identified as critical process parameters for virus inactivation. Removal of Simulsol SL 11W was readily achieved by Protein A chromatography and product quality was not affected by detergent treatment. Taken together, these results have shown the potential of Simulsol SL 11W as a desirable alternative to Triton X-100 for enveloped virus inactivation that could be readily implemented into biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes.",['(c) 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.'],"['Luo, Wen', 'Hickman, Danielle', 'Keykhosravani, Mandana', 'Wilson, Joseph', 'Fink, Jamie', 'Huang, Lihua', 'Chen, Dayue', ""O'Donnell, Sean""]","['Luo W', 'Hickman D', 'Keykhosravani M', 'Wilson J', 'Fink J', 'Huang L', 'Chen D', ""O'Donnell S""]","['Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200706,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Triton X-100', '*glycoside', '*virus inactivation']",,2020/06/14 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/btpr.3036 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2020 Nov;36(6):e3036. doi: 10.1002/btpr.3036.

However, the clinical significance of serum miR-22 remained uncovered. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential prognostic value of serum miR-22 for AML. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 124 patients with AML and 60 healthy individuals. Serum miR-22 level was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and its potential clinical value was investigated. RESULTS: Our results showed that serum miR-22 expression was significantly downregulated in AML subjects compared to healthy controls. Serum miR-22 levels were lowest in AML patients with M4/M5 subtypes, and low serum miR-22 expression occurred more frequently in AML patients with higher white blood cell counts or poor cytogenetic risk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that serum miR-22 well differentiated AML cases from healthy controls. In addition, serum miR-22 downregulation was closely associated with worse clinical features and shorter survival. Low serum miR-22 expression was confirmed to be an independent predictor for overall survival and relapse-free survival in AML patients. Moreover, the expression level of serum miR-22 was dramatically increased following treatment. In addition, serum miR-22 levels were significantly higher in AML patients achieving complete remission (CR) than those without CR. CONCLUSION: Collectively, serum miR-22 might serve as a novel and promising prognostic biomarker for AML.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The main function of APOBEC3 (A3) proteins is to trigger an innate immune response to viral infections. Recent reports have shown that several APOBEC family proteins such as A3B can induce somatic mutations into genomic DNA and thus promote cancer development. However, the role of A3D on somatic mutations is unclear. Here, we identified the alternative splicing of A3D, and investigated each splice variant's subcellular localization and role in DNA mutagenesis. We identified four A3D variants, which all have one or two cytidine deaminase domains. The full-length form of A3D (variant 1) and truncated forms of A3D (variant 2, 6, 7) showed the ability to induce C/G to T/A transitions in foreign DNA and genomic DNA and retained antiretroviral activity.

This study assessed whether patients achieving early treatment response (ETR; partial cytogenetic response or BCR-ABL1 mRNA </=10% at 3 months) in daily practice also have a long-term survival benefit. METHODS: The Retrospective Evaluation of Early response in CML for long-term Treatment outcome (R-EFECT), a multicenter, retrospective chart review, documented patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP starting first-line TKI therapy in routine clinical practice. The primary aim was to assess the 5year overall survival rate. RESULTS: Of the 211 patients from 12 centers across Austria (January 2004-May 2010), 176 (median age, 56 years) were included in the analysis. All patients received first-line therapy with imatinib. Overall, 136 patients (77.3%) achieved ETR (ETR+ group), whereas 40 (22.7%) did not reach ETR (ETR- group). The ETR+ group had higher 5year overall survival (92.5% vs. 77.5%, P= 0.018) and progression-free survival (95.6% vs. 87.5%, P= 0.06) rates compared with the ETR- group. As expected, more patients in the ETR- group were switched to another TKI. At the last contact, 120 patients were still on imatinib and 44 had switched to another TKI (25 to nilotinib, 15 to dasatinib, and 4 to bosutinib). CONCLUSION: The data are in line with randomized trials demonstrating that ETR is associated with improved survival and thus confirmed these results in patients treated in daily clinical routine.",,"['Petzer, Andreas L', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Buxhofer-Ausch, Veronika', 'Sliwa, Thamer', 'Schmidt, Stefan', 'Greil, Richard', 'Wolfler, Albert', 'Pichler, Petra', 'Dormann, Clemens', 'Burgstaller, Sonja', 'Tinchon, Christoph', 'Lang, Alois', 'Goebel, Florian', 'Uthman, Shanow', 'Muenchmeier, Niklas', 'Valent, Peter']","['Petzer AL', 'Sperr WR', 'Buxhofer-Ausch V', 'Sliwa T', 'Schmidt S', 'Greil R', 'Wolfler A', 'Pichler P', 'Dormann C', 'Burgstaller S', 'Tinchon C', 'Lang A', 'Goebel F', 'Uthman S', 'Muenchmeier N', 'Valent P']","['Internal Medicine I, Department of Hematology, with Stem Cell Transplantation, Hemostaseology and Medical Oncology, Ordensklinikum Linz Barmherzige Schwestern/Elisabethinen, Linz, Austria. andreas.petzer@jku.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Internal Medicine I Department of Hematology with Stem Cell Transplantation, Hemostaseology and Medical Oncology, Ordensklinikum Linz Elisabethinen, Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine III: Hematology Oncology, Hanusch Hospital Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Internal Medicine V: Hematology-Oncology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research-Institute-CCCIT, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Klinische Abteilung fur Innere Medizin I, Universitatsklinikum St. Polten-Lilienfeld, Karl Landsteiner Privatuniversitat fur Gesundheitswissenschaften, Dunant-Platz 1, St. Polten, Austria.', 'Internal Medicine I, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Ordensklinikum Linz Barmherzige Schwestern, Linz, Austria.', 'Abteilung fur Innere Medizin IV, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, LKH Hochsteiermark-Leoben, Leoben, Austria.', 'Innere Medizin, Rotkreuzklinik Lindenberg, Lindenberg, Austria.', 'Oncology, Novartis Pharma GmbH, Vienna, Austria.', 'Oncology, Novartis Pharma GmbH, Vienna, Austria.', 'Oncology, Novartis Pharma GmbH, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200612,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,PMC7445202,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloiud leukemia', 'Chronic phase', 'Clinical routine', 'Retrospective evaluation', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2020/06/14 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00508-020-01690-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00508-020-01690-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2020 Aug;132(15-16):415-422. doi: 10.1007/s00508-020-01690-1.

After newborn screening has been completed, some states store the residual dried bloodspots. It is unknown how they have been used to address health disparities-related research. METHODS: In 2017-2018, a scoping review was conducted to evaluate the extent, type, and nature of how residual dried bloodspots. The review included 654 eligible publications, worldwide, published before May 2017. A post hoc analysis of the US-based studies using residual dried bloodspots (n = 192) were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 32 (16.7%) articles identified that studied a condition of a known health disparity or focused on a key population: 25 studies assessed a disease or condition, 6 expressly enrolled a key population, and 1 study included both (i.e., heart disease and African American/Black). CONCLUSION: Excluding 12 studies that researched leukemia or a brain tumor, only 20 studies addressed a known health disparity, with 6 stating a specific aim to address a health disparity.

It was shown critical for primitive hematopoiesis. We previously showed an association between higher HOPX expression and clinical characteristics related to stemness and quiescence of leukemic cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. To further explore its physiologic functions in hematopoietic system, we generated a mouse model with hematopoietic cell-specific knockout of Hopx (Hopx(-/-)). In young Hopx(-/-) mice, the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) showed decreased reconstitution ability after serial transplantation. Further transcriptomic study revealed decreased HSC signatures in long-term HSCs from the Hopx(-/-) mice. At 18 months of age, half of the Hopx(-/-) mice developed cytopenia and splenomegaly. Bone marrow (BM) from the sick mice showed myeloid hyperplasia with predominant mature neutrophils, and decreased progenitor cells and lymphocytes. These phenotypes suggested critical functions of Hopx in maintaining HSC quiescence. Transcriptomic study of the Hopx(-/-) marrow cells showed significant downregulation of the Cxcl12-Cxcr4 axis, which is critical for maintenance of HSC quiescence. We next examined the role of Hopx in AML by using the MN1 overexpression murine leukemia model. Mice transplanted with MN1-overexpressed Hopx(-/-) BM cells developed AML with more aggressive phenotypes compared with those transplanted with MN1-overexpressed Hopx-wild cells. Hopx(-/-) MN1-overexpressed leukemia cells showed higher proliferation rate and downregulation of Cxcl12 and Cxcr4. Furthermore, in human AML, BM plasma CXCL12 levels were lower in patients with lower HOPX expression. In conclusion, our study highlights the roles of Hopx in maintenance of quiescence of the hematopoietic stem cells through CXCL12 pathway in vivo and provides implication of this protein in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",,"['Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Yao, Chi-Yuan', 'Hsu, Yueh-Chwen', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Yuan, Chang-Tsu', 'Li, Yi-Hung', 'Kao, Chein-Jun', 'Chuang, Po-Han', 'Chiu, Yu-Chiao', 'Chen, Yidong', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Lin CC', 'Yao CY', 'Hsu YC', 'Hou HA', 'Yuan CT', 'Li YH', 'Kao CJ', 'Chuang PH', 'Chiu YC', 'Chen Y', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Animal Science, Chinese Culture University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA."", ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. wchou@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. wchou@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. hftien@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200612,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,,2020/06/14 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-1340-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-1340-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Jul;39(28):5112-5123. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1340-2.

We show that NSD1 knockdown alters erythroid clonogenic growth of human CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. Ablation of Nsd1 in the hematopoietic system of mice induces a transplantable erythroleukemia. In vitro differentiation of Nsd1(-/-) erythroblasts is majorly impaired despite abundant expression of GATA1, the transcriptional master regulator of erythropoiesis, and associated with an impaired activation of GATA1-induced targets. Retroviral expression of wildtype NSD1, but not a catalytically-inactive NSD1(N1918Q) SET-domain mutant induces terminal maturation of Nsd1(-/-) erythroblasts. Despite similar GATA1 protein levels, exogenous NSD1 but not NSD(N1918Q) significantly increases the occupancy of GATA1 at target genes and their expression. Notably, exogenous NSD1 reduces the association of GATA1 with the co-repressor SKI, and knockdown of SKI induces differentiation of Nsd1(-/-) erythroblasts.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 27 cases of childhood AMKL admitted from November 2009 to July 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The survival analysis and prognostic factors were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The median follow-up time was 26.4 months in 27 cases, and the complete response rate was 92.31% after 2 chemotherapy courses. Eight patients underwent bone marrow transplantation after 3-6 courses. Five patients died after transplantation, 4 of whom died due to recurrence after transplantation. Of the 27 patients, 10 developed recurrence (37.04%), and 8/10 had recurrence within 1 year. The 3-year overall survival rate and disease-free survival rates were (47+/-12)% and (36+/-14)%, respectively. Of the 27 AMKL cases, the 3 with Down syndrome (DS-AMKL) all survived after treatment, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 100%. However, of the other 24 AMKL patients without Down syndrome (non-DS-AMKL), 6 died and 6 abandoned treatment, and the 3-year overall survival rate was only 50%. Univariate analysis showed that 3-year overall survival rate was not correlated to gender, age, number of newly diagnosed white blood cells, karyotype, remission after 2 courses of treatment, and transplant after 3 courses of treatment of childhood AMKL cases. Nevertheless, recurrence and remission after 2 courses of treatment were significantly correlated with 3-year overall survival rate. CONCLUSIONS Children with non-DS-AMKL have a high degree of malignancy and are prone to early recurrence with a poor prognosis, whereas the prognosis of DS-AMKL is relatively good. Recurrence after treatment and remission after 2 courses of treatment are important factors influencing the prognosis of childhood AMKL. Recurrence after transplantation is the leading cause of death in transplantation patients.",,"['Qi, Haixiao', 'Mao, Yan', 'Cao, Qian', 'Sun, Xingzhen', 'Kuai, Wenxia', 'Song, Junhong', 'Ma, Li', 'Hong, Ze', 'Hu, Jian', 'Zhou, Guoping']","['Qi H', 'Mao Y', 'Cao Q', 'Sun X', 'Kuai W', 'Song J', 'Ma L', 'Hong Z', 'Hu J', 'Zhou G']","['Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', ""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", 'Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200613,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,PMC7309653,,,,2020/06/14 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['922662 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.922662 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Jun 13;26:e922662. doi: 10.12659/MSM.922662.,,,,20210406,,IM,"['Anemia/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Hepatomegaly/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Splenomegaly/etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective study, anesthesia data were abstracted from medical records for 111 patients treated with risk-adapted protocol therapy at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Neurocognitive testing data were obtained for 90.9% of patients. RESULTS: For the 101 patients (62.4% male) who completed testing, mean age at diagnosis was 10.1 years, and 74.3% were staged to have average-risk disease. Anesthesia exposure during treatment ranged from 1 to 52 events (mean = 19.9); mean cumulative duration per patient was 21.1 hours (range 0.7-59.7). Compared with normative expectations (16%), the group had a significantly greater frequency of at-risk scores (<1 SD) on measures of intelligence (28.7%), attention (35.2%), working memory (26.6%), processing speed (46.7%), and reading (25.8%). Including anesthesia exposure duration to linear regression models accounting for age at diagnosis, treatment intensity, and baseline IQ significantly increased the predicted variance for intelligence (r(2) = 0.59), attention (r(2) = 0.29), working memory (r(2) = 0.31), processing speed (r(2) = 0.44), and reading (r(2) = 0.25; all P values <.001). CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of childhood medulloblastoma, a neurodevelopmentally vulnerable population, greater exposure to anesthesia significantly and independently predicts deficits in neurocognitive and academic functioning. When feasible, anesthesia exposure during treatment should be reduced.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Several natural substances of plant origin have been demonstrated to be successful in the prevention and treatment of numerous tumors. Rosmarinus officinalis L. is a herb that is cultivated in diverse areas of the world. There is increasing attention being directed towards the pharmaceutical capacities of rosemary, utilized for its anti-inflammatory, anti-infective or anticancer action. The antitumor effect of rosemary has been related to diverse mechanisms, such as the antioxidant effect, antiangiogenic properties, epigenetic actions, regulation of the immune response and anti-inflammatory response, modification of specific metabolic pathways, and increased expression of onco-suppressor genes. In this review, we aim to report the results of preclinical studies dealing with the anticancer effects of rosemary, the molecular mechanisms related to these actions, and the interactions between rosemary and anticancer drugs. The prospect of utilizing rosemary as an agent in the treatment of different neoplastic diseases is discussed. However, although the use of rosemary in the therapy of neoplasms constitutes a fascinating field of study, large and controlled studies must be conducted to definitively clarify the real impact of this substance in clinical practice.",,"['Allegra, Alessandro', 'Tonacci, Alessandro', 'Pioggia, Giovanni', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Gangemi, Sebastiano']","['Allegra A', 'Tonacci A', 'Pioggia G', 'Musolino C', 'Gangemi S']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.', 'Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), 56124 Pisa, Italy.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), 98164 Messina, Italy.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.', 'School and Operative Unit of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200610,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,PMC7352773,['NOTNLM'],"['Rosmarinus officinalis L.', 'cancer', 'carnosic acid', 'carnosol', 'chemoresistance', 'leukemia', 'rosemary', 'synergistic effect']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2020/06/14 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12061739 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12061739 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Jun 10;12(6). pii: nu12061739. doi: 10.3390/nu12061739.,,6,,20210329,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/prevention & control', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rosmarinus/*chemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify microRNAs involved in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes T-ALL and B-ALL, peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were independently subjected to microarray analysis using two different high-fidelity array platforms. The unique and common gene signatures from both arrays were validated by TaqMan individual assays in 100 pediatric ALL samples. Survival studies were carried out in the test set and validation set with 50 randomly selected samples in each set. MicroRNA expression profile revealed characteristic signatures for distinguishing T and B lineages and identified 51 novel microRNAs in pediatric ALL. Interestingly, the present study also revealed endogenous similarities and differences between blood and bone marrow within each ALL subtype. When Cox regression analysis was carried out with these identified microRNAs, 11 of them exhibited expression levels significantly correlated with survival. Validation of some of the common and relevant microRNAs from both arrays showed that their targets are involved in key oncogenic signaling pathways. Thus, this study suggests that microRNAs have the potential to become important diagnostic tools for identification and monitoring clinical outcomes in ALL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Here, we report two potent small-molecule FTO inhibitors that exhibit strong anti-tumor effects in multiple types of cancers. We show that genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of FTO dramatically attenuate leukemia stem/initiating cell self-renewal and reprogram immune response by suppressing expression of immune checkpoint genes, especially LILRB4. FTO inhibition sensitizes leukemia cells to T cell cytotoxicity and overcomes hypomethylating agent-induced immune evasion.

CISH(-/-) iPSC-NK cells demonstrate increased IL-15-mediated JAK-STAT signaling activity. Consequently, CISH(-/-) iPSC-NK cells exhibit improved expansion and increased cytotoxic activity against multiple tumor cell lines when maintained at low cytokine concentrations. CISH(-/-) iPSC-NK cells display significantly increased in vivo persistence and inhibition of tumor progression in a leukemia xenograft model. Mechanistically, CISH(-/-) iPSC-NK cells display improved metabolic fitness characterized by increased basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, maximal mitochondrial respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and spare respiration capacity mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling that directly contributes to enhanced NK cell function.

A pilot study.,421-428,10.1002/cyto.b.21890 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Within the hematopoietic compartment, fibromodulin (FMOD) is almost exclusively expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes. We set out to determine whether FMOD could be of help in diagnosing borderline lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD). METHODS: We established 3 flow cytometry-defined groups (CLL [n = 65], borderline LPD [n = 28], broadly defined as those with CLLflow score between 35 and -20 or discordant CD43 and CLLflow, and non-CLL LPD [n = 40]). FMOD expression levels were determined by standard RT-PCR in whole-blood samples. Patients were included regardless of lymphocyte count but with tumor burden >/=40%. RESULTS: FMOD expression levels distinguished between CLL (median 98.5, interquartile range [IQR] 37.8-195.1) and non-CLL LPD (median 0.012, IQR 0.003-0.033) with a sensitivity and specificity of 1. Most borderline LPDs were CD5/CD23/CD200-positive with no loss of B-cell antigens and negative or partial expression of CD43. 16/22 patients with available cytogenetic analysis showed trisomy 12. In 25/28 (89%) of these patients, FMOD expression levels fell between CLL and non-CLL (median 3.58, IQR 1.06-6.21). DISCUSSION: This study could suggest that borderline LPDs may constitute a distinct group laying in the biological spectrum of chronic leukemic LPDs. Future studies will have to confirm these results with other biological data. Quantification of FMOD can potentially be of help in the diagnosis of phenotypically complex LPDs.",['(c) 2020 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Sorigue, Marc', 'Junca, Jordi', 'Ferra, Christelle', 'Marce, Silvia', 'Ruiz-Xiville, Neus', 'Pinyol, Laia', 'Cabezon, Marta', 'Espasa, Andrea', 'Dominguez, Diana', 'Lopez-Viaplana, Laia', 'Ruiz, Rocio', 'Buch, Joan', 'Plensa, Esther', 'Mostacedo, Silvia-Zdenka', 'Aranda, Jessica', 'Vergara, Sara', 'Raya, Minerva', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Tapia, Gustavo', 'Navarro, Jose-Tomas', 'Bea, Silvia', 'Zamora, Lurdes']","['Sorigue M', 'Junca J', 'Ferra C', 'Marce S', 'Ruiz-Xiville N', 'Pinyol L', 'Cabezon M', 'Espasa A', 'Dominguez D', 'Lopez-Viaplana L', 'Ruiz R', 'Buch J', 'Plensa E', 'Mostacedo SZ', 'Aranda J', 'Vergara S', 'Raya M', 'Granada I', 'Tapia G', 'Navarro JT', 'Bea S', 'Zamora L']","['Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Mataro, Spain.', 'Institut Josep Carreres contra la leucemia, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Calella, Calella and ICO-Girona, Girona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Mataro, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Calella, Calella and ICO-Girona, Girona, Spain.', 'Institut Josep Carreres contra la leucemia, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200612,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

However, not all laboratories are resourced for consensus Euroflow pre-lysis methodology. Our study aim was to validate a modified pre-lysis protocol against our standard post-lysis method for MRD detection of multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and B-non Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), to meet demand for deeper MRD assessment by flow cytometry. METHOD: Clinical samples for MRD assessment of MM, CLL, and B-NHL (50, 30, and 30 cases, respectively) were prepared in parallel by pre and post-lysis methods for the initial validation. Total leukocytes, MRD, and median fluorescence intensity of antigen expression were compared as measures of sensitivity and antigen stability. Lymphocyte and granulocyte composition were compared, assessing relative sample processing stability. Sensitivity of the pre-lysis assay was monitored post validation for a further 18 months. RESULTS: Pre-lysis achieved at least 10(-4) sensitivity in 85% MM, 81% CLL, and 90% B-NHL samples versus 24%, 48%, and 26% by post-lysis, respectively, with stable antigen expression and leukocyte composition. Post validation over 18 months with technical expertise improving, pre-lysis permitted 10(-5) MRD assessment in 69%, 86%, and 82% of the respective patient groups. CONCLUSION: This modified pre-lysis procedure provides a sensitive, robust, time efficient, and relatively cost-effective alternative for MRD testing by MFC at 10(-5) , facilitating clinically meaningful deeper response assessment for MM, CLL, and B-NHL. This method adaptation may facilitate more widespread adoption of highly sensitive flow cytometry-based MRD assessment.",['(c) 2020 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Bayly, Emma', 'Nguyen, Vuong', 'Binek, Adrian', 'Piggin, Anna', 'Baldwin, Kylie', 'Westerman, David', 'Came, Neil']","['Bayly E', 'Nguyen V', 'Binek A', 'Piggin A', 'Baldwin K', 'Westerman D', 'Came N']","['Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200612,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

TKs are important mediators in signaling cascades, facilitating diverse biological processes in response to stimuli. TKs may acquire mutations leading to malignancy and are viable targets for anti-cancer drugs. Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor KIT is a TK involved in cell differentiation, whose dysregulation leads to various types of cancer, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leukemia, and melanoma. KIT can be targeted by a range of inhibitors that predominantly bind to the inactive state of the enzyme. A mutation Y823D in the activation loop of KIT is known to be responsible for the loss of sensitivity to some drugs in metastatic tumors. We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of Y823D on the KIT conformation and dynamics and compared it to the effect of phosphorylation of Y823. We simulated in total 6.4 mus of wild-type, mutant and phosphorylated KIT in the active- and inactive-state conformations. We found that Y823D affects the protein dynamics differently: in the active state, the mutation increases the protein stability, whereas in the inactive state it induces local destabilization, thus shifting the dynamic equilibrium towards the active state, altering the communication between distant regulatory regions. The observed dynamics of the Y823D mutant is similar to the dynamics of KIT phosphorylated at position Y823, thus we hypothesize that this mutation mimics a constitutively active kinase, which is not responsive to inhibitors that bind its inactive conformation.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a disease often associated with inherited defects in cell-mediated cytotoxicity, serves as a prototypical CSS for which the 5-year survival is only 60%. Frontline therapy for HLH consists of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) and the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Many patients, however, are refractory to this treatment or relapse after an initial response. Notably, many cytokines that are elevated in HLH activate the JAK/STAT pathway, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (RUX) has shown efficacy in murine HLH models and humans with refractory disease. We recently reported that cytokine-induced JAK/STAT signaling mediates DEX resistance in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, and that this could be effectively reversed by RUX. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that cytokine-mediated JAK/STAT signaling might similarly contribute to DEX resistance in HLH, and that RUX treatment would overcome this phenomenon. Using ex vivo assays, a murine model of HLH, and primary patient samples, we demonstrate that the hypercytokinemia of HLH reduces the apoptotic potential of CD8 T cells leading to relative DEX resistance. Upon exposure to RUX, this apoptotic potential is restored, thereby sensitizing CD8 T cells to DEX-induced apoptosis in vitro and significantly reducing tissue immunopathology and HLH disease manifestations in vivo. Our findings provide rationale for combining DEX and RUX to enhance the lymphotoxic effects of DEX and thus improve the outcomes for patients with HLH and related CSS.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Meyer, Lauren K', 'Verbist, Katherine C', 'Albeituni, Sabrin', 'Scull, Brooks P', 'Bassett, Rachel C', 'Stroh, Alexa N', 'Tillman, Heather', 'Allen, Carl E', 'Hermiston, Michelle L', 'Nichols, Kim E']","['Meyer LK', 'Verbist KC', 'Albeituni S', 'Scull BP', 'Bassett RC', 'Stroh AN', 'Tillman H', 'Allen CE', 'Hermiston ML', 'Nichols KE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC7414590,,,,2020/06/13 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61816-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020006075 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Aug 6;136(6):657-668. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020006075.,"['P30 CA082103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",6,,20210309,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (perforin 1, mouse)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinases', 'Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis/complications/physiopathology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitriles', 'Perforin/deficiency', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",,,,,['Blood. 2020 Aug 6;136(6):645-646.

METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was performed in cancer outpatients who started treatment with a targeted OAA between 1 December 2015 and 31 May 2019. PDIs were analyzed using the Lexicomp(R) and the database About Herbs(R). PDIs were classified according to severity, risk, and reliability ratings and their underlying mechanism. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify risk factors associated with PDIs. RESULTS: A total of 881 patients were included, of whom 50.9% had at least 1 PDI between the OAA and the concomitant medication. The factors associated with a higher risk of PDIs were polypharmacy (>/=5 concomitant medicines) (OR = 3.64 (2.54-5.20), p < 0.001), type of tumor (prostate cancer [OR = not available, p < 0.001], chronic myelogenous leukemia [OR = 5.10 (1.08-24.05), p = 0.040], sarcoma [OR = 4.97 (1.05-23.55), p = 0.043]), and treatment with hormone therapies (OR = not available, p < 0.001).

Single-institution and registry studies have shown that, in both children and adults with AL, the outcome of UCBT is comparable to that of matched unrelated donor. At the same time, these studies have highlighted some limitations of UCBT, such as increased early mortality and delayed recovery of both hematopoietic and immune compartment, which hamper a more widespread adoption of this approach. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we will analyze the current results of UCBT in children and adults with AL, including comparisons with other hematopoietic stem cell sources and transplant strategies. We will also discuss important factors to be considered when selecting UCB units, as well as future strategies to further improve the outcome of UCBT recipients. EXPERT OPINION: The utilization of UCBT for the treatment of AL patients has decreased in recent years. However, recent clinical data suggesting that UCBT might offer better results in patients with minimal residual disease, as well as innovative strategies to facilitate engraftment, reduce transplant-related mortality, and optimize anti-leukemic activity, may pave the way toward a second youth for use of UCB cells.",,"['Algeri, Mattia', 'Gaspari, Stefania', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Algeri M', 'Gaspari S', 'Locatelli F']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Scientific Institute for Research and Healthcare (IRCCS), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Scientific Institute for Research and Healthcare (IRCCS), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Scientific Institute for Research and Healthcare (IRCCS), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital , Rome, Italy."", 'Sapienza University of Rome , Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200622,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*adoptive cell therapy', '*cell dose', '*cord blood expansion and homing', '*double cord transplantation', '*engraftment', '*minimal residual disease', '*umbilical cord blood transplantation']",,2020/06/13 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2020.1782380 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2020 Oct;20(10):1223-1236. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2020.1782380.

Historically, the coupling between muscle and bone has been viewed in light of mechanotransduction, which dictates that the mechanical forces applied to muscle are transmitted to the skeleton to initiate bone formation. However, these organs also communicate through the endocrine system, orchestrated by a family of cytokines namely myokines (derived from myocytes) and osteokines (derived from bone cells). A third player in this biochemical crosstalk is adipose tissue and the secretion of adipokines (derived from adipocytes). In this review, we discuss the bidirectional effects of myokines and osteokines on muscle and bone metabolism, and the impact of adipokines on both of these secretory organs. RECENT FINDINGS: Several myokines, notably, IL6, irisin, IGF-1, BDNF, myostatin, and FGF2 exert anabolic/catabolic effects on bone, while the osteokines osteocalcin and sclerostin have shown to induce muscle anabolism and catabolism, respectively. Adipokines, such as leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and TNFalpha (released from adipose tissue), can also modulate muscle and bone metabolism. Contrarily, exercise-mediated release of lipolytic myokines (IL6, irisin, and LIF) stimulates thermogenesis by promoting the browning of adipocytes. Myokines, osteokines, and adipokines exert autocrine/paracrine effects locally as well as through the endocrine system, to regulate muscle, bone, and fat metabolism. Reductions in physical activity and increases in energy intake, both linked with aging, leads to adipocyte hypertrophy and the recruitment of immunological cells (macrophages). In turn, this releases pro-inflammatory adipokines which induces chronic low-grade inflammation (LGI), a key player in the pathology of several diseases.

These cells are practically immortalized and are of myeloid origin. Proliferation, clonogenic and stromal co-culture assays showed that the MLL-AF9 cells were considerably more sensitive to Zoledronic acid than normal hematopoietic CD34(+) cells or MS-5 stromal cells. The MLL-AF9 cells were notably more inhibited by Zoledronic acid when cultured as colonies in 3 dimensions, requiring cell-cell contacts compared to suspension expansion cultures. This is coherent with the mechanism of action of Zoledronic acid inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase which results in a block in prenylation of GTPases such that their role in the membrane is compromised for cell-cell contacts. Zoledronic acid can be proposed to target the MLL-AF9 leukemic stem cells before they emerge from the hematopoietic niche, which being in proximity to bone osteoclasts where Zoledronic acid is sequestered can be predicted to result in sufficient levels to result in an anti-leukemic action.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Chiarella, Emanuela', 'Codispoti, Bruna', 'Aloisio, Annamaria', 'Cosentino, Emanuela G', 'Scicchitano, Stefania', 'Montalcini, Ylenia', 'Lico, Daniela', 'Morrone, Giovanni', 'Mesuraca, Maria', 'Bond, Heather M']","['Chiarella E', 'Codispoti B', 'Aloisio A', 'Cosentino EG', 'Scicchitano S', 'Montalcini Y', 'Lico D', 'Morrone G', 'Mesuraca M', 'Bond HM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Tecnologica Research Institute-Marrelli Health, 88900 Crotone, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Exiris S.r.l., 00128 Roma, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Obstetrics & Ginecology, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200605,England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,PMC7283156,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological sciences', 'Bisphosphonate', 'Cancer research', 'Cell biology', 'MLL-AF9 gene rearrangement', 'Molecular biology', 'Zoledronic acid']",,2020/06/13 06:00,2020/06/13 06:01,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04020 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(20)30864-1 [pii]', 'e04020 [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2020 Jun 5;6(6):e04020. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04020. eCollection 2020 Jun.,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as having a key role in a number of human diseases, including cancer. Here, we investigated mitochondrial damage resulting from treatment with a recently characterized pan-SIRT inhibitor, MC2494. MC2494 was able to block mitochondrial biogenesis and function in terms of ATP synthesis and energy metabolism, suggesting that it might orchestrate cell response to metabolic stress and thereby interfere with cancer promotion and progression. Targeting mitochondrial function could thus be considered a potential anticancer strategy for use in clinical therapy.","[""Copyright (c) 2020 Carafa, Russo, Della Torre, Cuomo, Dell'Aversana, Sarno,"", 'Sgueglia, Di Donato, Rotili, Mai, Nebbioso, Cobellis, Chambery and Altucci.']","['Carafa, Vincenzo', 'Russo, Rosita', 'Della Torre, Laura', 'Cuomo, Francesca', ""Dell'Aversana, Carmela"", 'Sarno, Federica', 'Sgueglia, Giulia', 'Di Donato, Marzia', 'Rotili, Dante', 'Mai, Antonello', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Cobellis, Gilda', 'Chambery, Angela', 'Altucci, Lucia']","['Carafa V', 'Russo R', 'Della Torre L', 'Cuomo F', ""Dell'Aversana C"", 'Sarno F', 'Sgueglia G', 'Di Donato M', 'Rotili D', 'Mai A', 'Nebbioso A', 'Cobellis G', 'Chambery A', 'Altucci L']","['Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Ambientali Biologiche e Farmaceutiche, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Caserta, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Institute Experimental Endocrinology and Oncology ""Gaetano Salvatore"" (IEOS)- National Research Council (CNR), Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Chimica e Tecnologie del Farmaco, ""Sapienza"" Universita di Roma, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Chimica e Tecnologie del Farmaco, ""Sapienza"" Universita di Roma, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Ambientali Biologiche e Farmaceutiche, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Caserta, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione, Universita degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200521,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7255067,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'energy production', 'epigenetic', 'leukemia', 'mitochondria', 'proteomic analysis', 'sirtuins']",,2020/06/13 06:00,2020/06/13 06:01,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00820 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 May 21;10:820. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00820. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a significantly improved prognosis over the last decade with a 5-years survival rate of ~90%, treatment-related morbidity remains substantial and relapse occurs in 10-15% of patients (1). The most common site of relapse is the bone marrow, but early colonization and subsequent reoccurrence of the disease in the central nervous system (CNS) also occurs. Integrins are a family of cell surface molecules with a longstanding history in cancer cell adherence, migration and metastasis. In chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), the VLA-4 integrin has been acknowledged as a prognostic marker and mounting evidence indicates that this and other integrins may also play a role in acute leukemia, including ALL. Importantly, integrins engage in anti-apoptotic signaling when binding extracellular molecules that are enriched in the bone marrow and CNS microenvironments. Here, we review the current evidence for a role of integrins in the adherence of ALL cells within the bone marrow and their colonization of the CNS, with particular emphasis on mechanisms adding to cancer cell survival and chemoresistance.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Scharff, Modvig, Marquart and Christensen.']","['Scharff, Bibi Fatima Syed Shah', 'Modvig, Signe', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke', 'Christensen, Claus']","['Scharff BFSS', 'Modvig S', 'Marquart HV', 'Christensen C']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200522,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7256886,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'chemoresistance', 'integrins']",,2020/06/13 06:00,2020/06/13 06:01,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00775 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 May 22;10:775. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00775. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PAP is classically classified into three categories (Table 1): 1/primary (or autoimmune) with antibodies targeting the GM-CSF pathway, 2/secondary to another disease, typically a hematologic malignancy, and 3/genetic. CASE-REPORT: A 30 year-old woman received an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Within the first 6 months post HSCT, she developed an ocular, oral, digestive and hepatic graft-versus-host disease associated with a mixed ventilatory defect with a very severe obstructive syndrome and a severe CO diffusion impairment. High resolution computed tomography showed a classical ""crazy paving"" pattern. Aspect and differential cell count of BAL were normal. All microbiological samples remained culture negative. Histo-pathological analysis of transbronchial biopsies was unremarkable. Because of the severity of the respiratory insufficiency, open-lung biopsy (OBL) could not be performed. Despite multiple immunosuppressive therapies, lung function deteriorated rapidly; the patient also developed an excavated fungal lesion unresponsive to treatment. She underwent a bilateral lung transplant 48 months after HSCT. Histo-pathological analysis of explanted lungs showed obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), diffuse PAP and invasive cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the simultaneous occurrence of OB, PAP and a fungal infection in a 30-year old female patient who underwent HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

However, owing to the heterogeneity of tumors and individual immune systems, PD-L1/PD-1 blockade still shows slow response rates in controlling malignancies in many patients. Accumulating evidence has shown that an effective response to anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 therapy requires establishing an integrated immune cycle. Damage in any step of the immune cycle is one of the most important causes of immunotherapy failure. Impairments in the immune cycle can be restored by epigenetic modification, including reprogramming the environment of tumor-associated immunity, eliciting an immune response by increasing the presentation of tumor antigens, and by regulating T cell trafficking and reactivation. Thus, a rational combination of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade and epigenetic agents may offer great potential to retrain the immune system and to improve clinical outcomes of checkpoint blockade therapy.","['(c) 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica,', 'Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

It is crucial to pursue workup for patients with isolated thrombocytosis through testing for the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene or the Philadephia chromosome in both PB and the BM in order to distinguish CML from essential thrombocythemia.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Findakly et al.']","['Findakly, Dawood', 'Arslan, Waqas']","['Findakly D', 'Arslan W']","['Internal Medicine, Creighton University Arizona Health Education Alliance/Valleywise Health Medical Center, Phoenix, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Creighton University Arizona Health Education Alliance/Valleywise Health, Phoenix, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Creighton University Maricopa Medical Center, Phoenix, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200607,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC7282382,['NOTNLM'],"['bcr-abl positive', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'isolated thrombocytosis', 'philadelphia chromosome', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/06/13 06:00,2020/06/13 06:01,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8498 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jun 7;12(6):e8498. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8498.,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by highly variable outcomes and usually disrupts the normal architecture of the normal tissue in which it originates. It may occur de novo or be associated with other hematological malignancies. Clinical presentation of myeloid sarcomas can be highly variable based on the tumor site, size, and extent of tissue involvement. The diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. Tissue sampling followed by the use of auxiliary studies is essential for diagnosis. Moreover, bone marrow sampling is necessary to exclude morrow involvement. Currently, the recommended therapeutic regimens for myeloid sarcoma are similar to those for acute myeloid leukemia. Much work remains to be accomplished as myeloid sarcomas, if initially missed or misdiagnosed, have poor overall survival rates. Furthermore, prognostic factors for this malignancy remain poorly understood.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Al-Obaidi et al.']","['Al-Obaidi, Ammar', 'Parker, Nathaniel A', 'Hussein Agha, Yasmine', 'Alqam, Hamzah', 'Page, Seth']","['Al-Obaidi A', 'Parker NA', 'Hussein Agha Y', 'Alqam H', 'Page S']","['Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Wichita, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Wichita, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Wichita, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Ascension Via Christi St. Francis, Wichita, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Wichita, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200605,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC7279692,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogenic bone marrow transplant', 'chemotherapy', 'extramedullary leukemia', 'granulocytic sarcoma', 'myeloid sarcoma', 'pancreatic sarcoma']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/06/13 06:00,2020/06/13 06:01,['2020/06/13 06:00'],"['2020/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8462 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jun 5;12(6):e8462. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8462.,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the feasibility of manufacturing CAR T-cell products from heavily pre-treated patients with this system has not been demonstrated yet. Here we report and characterize the production of 28 CAR T-cell products in the context of a phase I clinical trial for CD19+ B-cell malignancies (NCT03144583). The system includes CD4-CD8 cell selection, lentiviral transduction and T-cell expansion using IL-7/IL-15. Twenty-seven out of 28 CAR T-cell products manufactured met the full list of specifications and were considered valid products. Ex vivo cell expansion lasted an average of 8.5 days and had a mean transduction rate of 30.6 +/- 13.44%. All products obtained presented cytotoxic activity against CD19+ cells and were proficient in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Expansion kinetics was slower in patient's cells compared to healthy donor's cells. However, product potency was comparable. CAR T-cell subset phenotype was highly variable among patients and largely determined by the initial product. TCM and TEM were the predominant T-cell phenotypes obtained. 38.7% of CAR T-cells obtained presented a TN or TCM phenotype, in average, which are the subsets capable of establishing a long-lasting T-cell memory in patients. An in-depth analysis to identify individual factors contributing to the optimal T-cell phenotype revealed that ex vivo cell expansion leads to reduced numbers of TN, TSCM, and TEFF cells, while TCM cells increase, both due to cell expansion and CAR-expression. Overall, our results show for the first time that clinical-grade production of CAR T-cells for heavily pre-treated patients using CliniMACS Prodigy system is feasible, and that the obtained products meet the current quality standards of the field. Reduced ex vivo expansion may yield CAR T-cell products with increased persistence in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Castella, Caballero-Banos, Ortiz-Maldonado, Gonzalez-Navarro,', 'Sune,

However, by employing inhibitory signaling pathways, including PD-1/PD-L1, leukemia cells suppress T cell-mediated immune attack. Notably, impressive clinical efficacy has been obtained with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies in cancer patients. Yet, these systemic treatments are often accompanied by severe toxicity, especially after alloSCT. Here, we investigated RNA interference technology as an alternative strategy to locally interfere with PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in AML. We demonstrated efficient siRNA-mediated PD-L1 silencing in HL-60 and patients' AML cells. Importantly, WT1-antigen T cell receptor(+) PD-1(+) 2D3 cells showed increased activation toward PD-L1 silenced WT1(+) AML. Moreover, PD-L1 silenced AML cells significantly enhanced the activation, degranulation, and IFN-gamma production of minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Notably, PD-L1 silencing was equally effective as PD-1 antibody blockade. Together, our study demonstrates that PD-L1 silencing may be an effective strategy to augment AML immune-susceptibility.

Intensively treated patients with NPM1 and IDH2(R172) mutations had longer overall survival (OS), whereas mutated TP53 conferred lower CR rates and shorter OS. FLT3-ITD and TP53 mutations predicted worse OS in palliatively treated patients. Gene expression levels most predictive of CR were combined with somatic mutations for an integrated risk stratification that we externally validated using the beatAML cohort. We defined a high-risk group with a CR rate of 20% in patients with mutated TP53, compared to 97% CR in low-risk patients defined by high expression of ZBTB7A and EEPD1 without TP53 mutations. Patients without these criteria had a CR rate of 54% (intermediate risk). The difference in CR rates translated into significant OS differences that outperformed ELN stratification for OS prediction.

Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) assessment at 12 months post-HSCT is predictive of relapse. This phase 2 study aimed to achieve M12 MRD negativity (MRDneg) using MRD-driven immune-intervention (Md-PII) algorithm based on serial flow-cytometry blood MRD, involving cyclosporine tapering followed if failure by donor lymphocytes infusions. Patients had high-risk CLL according to 2006 EBMT consensus, in complete or partial response with lymphadenopathy < 5 cm and comorbidity score </= 2. Donors were HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated (10/10). Forty-two enrolled patients with either 17p deletion (front-line, n=11; relapse n=16) or other high-risk relapse (n=15) received reduced intensity-conditioning regimen before HSCT and were submitted to Md-PII. M12-MRDneg status was achieved in 64% versus 14.2% before HSCT. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 19-53), 3-year overall survival, non-relapse mortality and cumulative incidence of relapse are 86.9% (95%CI, 70.8-94.4), 9.5% (95%CI, 3.7-23.4) and 29.6% (95%CI, 17.3-47.7). Incidence of 2-year limited and extensive chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is 38% (95%CI, 23-53) and 23% (95%CI, 10-36) including 2 cases post Md-PII.

Outcome of patients with AML remains dismal, highlighting the need for improved, less toxic therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) immunotherapies for patients with refractory or relapse (R/R) AML are challenging because of the absence of a universal pan-AML target antigen and the shared expression of target antigens with normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), which may lead to life-threating on-target/off-tumor cytotoxicity. CD33-redirected and CD123-redirected CARTs for AML are in advanced preclinical and clinical development, and they exhibit robust antileukemic activity. However, preclinical and clinical controversy exists on whether such CARTs are myeloablative. METHODS: We set out to comparatively characterize in vitro and in vivo the efficacy and safety of 41BB-based and CD28-based CARCD123. We analyzed 97 diagnostic and relapse AML primary samples to investigate whether CD123 is a suitable immunotherapeutic target, and we used several xenograft models and in vitro assays to assess the myeloablative potential of our second-generation CD123 CARTs. RESULTS: Here, we show that CD123 represents a bona fide target for AML and show that both 41BB-based and CD28-based CD123 CARTs are very efficient in eliminating both AML cell lines and primary cells in vitro and in vivo. However, both 41BB-based and CD28-based CD123 CARTs ablate normal human hematopoiesis and prevent the establishment of de novo hematopoietic reconstitution by targeting both immature and myeloid HSPCs. CONCLUSIONS: This study calls for caution when clinically implementing CD123 CARTs, encouraging its preferential use as a bridge to allo-HSCT in patients with R/R AML.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Following the success of imatinib, second- and third-generation molecules were developed. Different profiles of kinase inhibition and off-target effects vary between TKIs, which leads to a broad spectrum of potential toxicities.Pulmonary complications are most frequently observed with dasatinib but all other Bcr-Abl TKIs have been implicated. Pleural effusions are the most frequent pulmonary complication of TKIs, usually associated with dasatinib and bosutinib. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is an uncommon but serious complication of dasatinib, which is often reversible upon discontinuation. Bosutinib and ponatinib have also been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension, while imatinib has not. Rarely, interstitial lung disease has been associated with TKIs, predominantly with imatinib.Mechanistically, dasatinib affects maintenance of normal pulmonary endothelial integrity by generating mitochondrial oxidative stress, inducing endothelial apoptosis and impairing vascular permeability in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanisms underlying other TKI-related complications are largely unknown. Awareness and early diagnosis of the pulmonary complications of Bcr-Abl TKIs is essential given their seriousness, potential reversibility, and impact on future treatment options for the underlying chronic myelogenous leukaemia.",['Copyright (c)ERS 2020.'],"['Weatherald, Jason', 'Bondeelle, Louise', 'Chaumais, Marie-Camille', 'Guignabert, Christophe', 'Savale, Laurent', 'Jais, Xavier', 'Sitbon, Olivier', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Humbert, Marc', 'Bergeron, Anne', 'Montani, David']","['Weatherald J', 'Bondeelle L', 'Chaumais MC', 'Guignabert C', 'Savale L', 'Jais X', 'Sitbon O', 'Rousselot P', 'Humbert M', 'Bergeron A', 'Montani D']","['University of Calgary, Dept of Medicine and Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'J.

This study presented two cases of patients undergoing allo-HSCT who were later selected for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). In the first patient, FMT resulted in the complete resolution of symptoms, whereas therapeutic efficacy was not achieved in the second patient. FMT eliminated drug-resistant pathogens, namely very drug-resistant Enterococcus spp., but not multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp. Further research is needed, particularly on the safety of FMT in patients with intestinal steroid-resistant GvHD and on the distant impact of transplanted microflora on the outcomes of allo-HSCT.

A Cox regression model was used to examine the prognostic effects of the biomarkers and clinical parameters. The presence of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) gene amplification and a lower immunohistochemical (IHC) marker of tumor necrotic factor alpha (TNF-alpha) H-score were two prognostic factors for inferior DFS. The four-year DFS was 28% and 68% for patients with or without MCL1 copy number gain, respectively (p = 0.028). In addition, MCL1 amplification predicted poor DMFS.

Aiming to simplify and possibly improve the patients' initial screening, we designed a capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel combining the Ig/TCR rearrangement detection with the profiling of relevant leukemia-related genes. The validation of the assay on well-characterized samples allowed us to identify all the known Ig/TCR rearrangements as well as additional clonalities, including rare rearrangements characterized by uncommon combinations of variable, diversity, and joining (V-D-J) gene segments, oligoclonal rearrangements, and low represented clones. Upon validation, the capture NGS approach allowed us to identify Ig/TCR clonal markers in 87% of a retrospective cohort (MRD-unknown within the Northern Italy Leukemia Group (NILG)-ALL 09/00 clinical trial) and in 83% of newly-diagnosed ALL cases in which conventional method failed, thus proving its prospective applicability. Finally, we identified gene variants in 94.7% of patients analyzed for mutational status with the same implemented capture assay.

Patients affected by a previous solid or leukaemic neoplasm during their childhood may develop a second different tumour during the follow-up. In this setting, salivary gland MEC is relatively frequent, accounting for 6% of the second neoplasms in paediatric patients. Consequently, the occurrence of salivary gland nodules in paediatric patients with a previous neoplasm should be considered an event with a high risk of malignancy that poses peculiar diagnostic challenges. SUMMARY: This study was designed to define clinical and instrumental findings and morphological features of MEC on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) samples in paediatric patients with and without a previous neoplasm. Five patients under 19 years are included in this series. FNAC was performed in all patients on a parotid nodule. We have identified 2 groups of patients: (a) 2 cases with previous history of malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and Hodgkin lymphoma) and (b) 3 cases without previous malignant neoplasms. In all cases, a final diagnosis of MEC was rendered. Key Messages: MEC may occur as a second malignancy in paediatric patients. FNAC is certainly a valid and accurate diagnostic tool for this type of neoplasm, even in the paediatric age, allowing the correct management of the patients.","['(c) 2020 S.

The chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) confirmed the 11q22 deletion and revealed a small interstitial deletion of IGL gene. In 2018, the patient presented with worsening lymphocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The peripheral blood smear revealed an increased prolymphocyte population, which comprised 60.4% of lymphoid cells, establishing a diagnosis of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. The CMA and G-banded chromosome analysis showed one additional aberration in the form of 1q gain translocated onto the other homologue 22. These findings suggested clonal evolution of CLL to B-PLL. The most common translocation involving immunoglobulin lambda chain (IGL) in CLL is the t(18;22), followed by t(8;22) and (11;22). An evolution to B-PLL occurs in most cases without gaining additional aberrations. Here, we report for the first time a novel translocation involving IGL with chromosome 10q21 and one 1q gain occurring in a patient with CLL that transformed to B-PLL. Based on the disease progression and this newly developed cytogenetic aberration, our case supports the progressive nature of CLL in the presence of IGL deletion and suggests the pathological role of 1q gain in CLL transformation.",['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],"['Sun, Lei', 'Patil, Vinit V', 'Wilgus, Nathan', 'Yao, Jianhui', 'Batanian, Jacqueline R']","['Sun L', 'Patil VV', 'Wilgus N', 'Yao J', 'Batanian JR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Missouri-Columbia School of Medicine, MO.', 'Department of Pathology, Saint Louis University, St Louis, MO.', 'Department of Pathology, Saint Louis University Hospital, St Louis, MO.', ""Department of Pathology, SLU Care Pediatrics/SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, St. Louis, MO."", ""Department of Pathology, SLU Care Pediatrics/SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, St. Louis, MO.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,2020/06/12 06:00,2020/06/12 06:01,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2020;46(2):92-97.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TMD often does not manifest clinically, but patients may show hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and other symptoms. While TMD is almost always present with trisomy 21, there are not many other cytogenetic abnormalities associated with TMD, with a few rare cases such as monosomy 7 and trisomy 8. Recent studies have suggested liver hematopoietic progenitor cells as the candidate for TMD origin. Furthermore, GATA1 mutations associated with TMD are found to encode for a stop codon in the N-terminal activation region of gene sequences. It has been shown that those mutations can cause overproliferation of megakaryocytes, which can cooperate with Down syndrome cells, which have trisomy 21, in the progression of TMD into acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). Since GATA1 mutations are present in all cases of myeloid leukemia of Down Syndrome, monitoring GATA1 in patients with trisomy 21 may assist with earlier diagnosis of TMD. Another likely cause of TMD is the amplification of the RUNX1 transcription factor gene located on chromosome 21. It has been shown that RUNX1 is associated with leukemias of myeloid lineage. While most cases of TMD will spontaneously resolve, some will evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this review, we will discuss the cytogenetic, molecular genetics and clinical aspects of TMD.",['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],"['Zhao, Diane', 'Shabsovich, David', 'Peng, Emily', 'Okabe, Anna', 'Yang, Grace', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Zhao D', 'Shabsovich D', 'Peng E', 'Okabe A', 'Yang G', 'Tirado CA']","['University of California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Baylor Scott and White Health System, Department of Pathology, Temple, TX.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,2020/06/12 06:00,2020/06/12 06:01,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2020;46(2):74-91.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responsible for 10-15% of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 25% of adult ALL patients, T-ALL is characterized not only by cytomorphic features, but also by the aberrant expression of specific genes critical to T-cell development. Such changes in the genome ultimately result in mutational and developmental cascades that alter the chromosomal constitution, the process of which are used to organize T-ALL cases into different subgroups according to specific gene expression signatures. Clinically, comprehensive categorizations are important in risk stratification, assessment, and treatment protocols. Notable genetic subgroups include that of TAL, TLX1, TLX3, HOXA, MYB, ETP and NKX2. Current research also recognizes phenotypic and immunologic categories, such as ALK-positive ALCL, ALK-negative ALCL, BIA ALCL, AITL, and PTCL, NOS, which has revolutionized our understanding of T-cell lymphoma. Furthermore, it has been suggested that most T-ALL patients present with abnormal NOTCH1 genes in addition to mutations involving the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. These abnormalities are associated with the regulatory malfunction of T-cell development as well as that of their respective tumor suppressors and oncogenes. While recent studies have revealed characteristic defects in T-ALL, the interactions between oncogenes and their tumor suppressors with leukemia development are not well known as the signaling pathways involved behind each genetic lesion have yet to be fully explored. Studies involving FISH, RT-PCR, aCGH, and NGS offer novel perspectives to potentially learn more about the pathogenesis and cytogenetics of T-ALL, a field that demands further attention and research.",['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],"['Nguyen, Andrew M', 'Okabe, Anna', 'Tse, Vincent', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Nguyen AM', 'Okabe A', 'Tse V', 'Tirado CA']","['University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The University of Minnesota, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Baylor Scott and White Health, Department of Pathology, Temple, TX.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,2020/06/12 06:00,2020/06/12 06:01,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2020;46(2):59-73.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, SAs confer negative charges to cell membranes, also contributing to hemorheology. Phenylboronic acids, called as mimetic lectins, have been highlighted to study SA profiles. The association of these interesting molecules with the optical properties of quantum dots (QDs) can provide a deeper/complementary understanding of mechanisms involving SAs. Herein, we explored the thiol affinity to the QD surface to develop a simple, fast and direct attachment procedure to functionalize these nanocrystals with 3-mercaptophenylboronic acids (MPBAs). The functionalization was confirmed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. The conjugate specificity/efficiency was proved in experiments using red blood cells (RBCs). A labeling >90% was found for RBCs incubated with conjugates, which reduced to 17% after neuraminidase pretreatment. Moreover, QDs-MPBA conjugates were applied in a comparative study using acute (KG-1) and chronic (K562) myelogenous leukemia cell lines. Results indicated that KG-1 membranes have a greater level of SA, with 100% of cells labeled and a median of fluorescence intensity of ca. 2.5-fold higher when compared to K562 (94%). Therefore, this novel QDs-MPBA conjugate can be considered a promising nanoplatform to evaluate SA contents in a variety of biological systems.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: We included data from two birth cohorts; the Danish National Birth Cohort and the Aarhus Birth Cohort. Recruitment of 141,216 eligible pregnancies occurred from 1 August 1989 to 31 December 2012. Information on maternal prenatal coffee intake and covariates was collected in early second trimester of pregnancy. Information on childhood AL diagnosed in offspring was obtained from the Danish National Patient Register. We used competing risk time-to-event regression analysis, using the pseudo-observation method to estimate risk ratio (RR) with no coffee intake during pregnancy considered the reference group. RESULTS: In total 96 children were diagnosed with AL, hereof 73 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Coffee intake of 0.5-3 cups/day during pregnancy was not associated with a higher risk of childhood AL; aRR = 0.89, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.48, 1.65, however, an intake of >3 cups/day resulted in aRR = 1.37, 95 % CI: 0.56, 3.32. Only including ALL as outcome we found similar results; aRR = 0.80, 95 % CI: 0.37-1.74 and aRR = 1.46 95 % CI: 0.52-4.09, respectively. CONCLUSION: We found no significant association between maternal coffee intake and risk of childhood AL but the number of cases was limited. The confidence limits does not exclude that a high prenatal coffee intake may increase the risk of childhood AL and larger studies based on prospective data are needed.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This work investigated the morphometry, cortical thickness, and subcortical volumes using MRI and their correlations with behavioral measures in pediatric oncology survivors treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-treated childhood cancer survivors (N = 15, 15.12 +/- 5.98 years old) diagnosed with a non-central nervous system malignancy and healthy age-matched controls (N = 15, 15.13 +/- 4.21 years old) were studied. MRI was acquired at 3 Tesla. Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) Parental Rating, Purdue Pegboard manual dexterity and n-back working memory measures were administered. Structural MRI scans at 3 Tesla were acquired. Voxel-based morphometry, cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were analyzed and correlated with behavioral scores. Parametric statistics with a p < .05 and adjusted for multiple comparison corrections were performed. Patients exhibited significantly smaller gray-matter volumes in the left globus pallidum, bilateral thalami, left caudate and left nucleus accumbens (p < .05) and thinner cortex in the right parahippocampal gyrus (p < .05) compared to controls. BRIEF scores were similar to normative values.

Among the potentially targetable AML antigens, CD33 is insofar one of the main validated molecules. Here, we describe the feasibility of engineering cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells with a CD33.CAR by using the latest optimized version of the non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system ""SB100X-pT4."" This offers the advantage of improving CAR expression on CIK cells, while reducing the amount of DNA transposase as compared to the previously employed ""SB11-pT"" version. SB-modified CD33.CAR-CIK cells exhibited significant antileukemic activity in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived AML xenograft models, reducing AML development when administered as an ""early treatment"" and delaying AML progression in mice with established disease. Notably, by exploiting an already optimized xenograft chemotherapy model that mimics human induction therapy in mice, we demonstrated for the first time that CD33.CAR-CIK cells are also effective toward chemotherapy resistant/residual AML cells, further supporting its future clinical development and implementation within the current standard regimens.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

During the last decade, we have gained significant knowledge about a wide range of epigenetic changes that crucially contribute to some of the most aggressive forms of leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndromes. DNA methylation is a key epigenetic player in the abnormal initiation, development, and progression of these malignancies, often acting in synergy with other epigenetic alterations. It also contributes to the acquisition of drug resistance. In this review, we summarize the role of DNA methylation in hematological malignancies described in the current literature. We discuss in detail the dual role of DNA methylation in normal and aberrant hematopoiesis, as well as the involvement of this type of epigenetic change in other aspects of the disease. Finally, we present a comprehensive overview of the main clinical implications, including a discussion of the therapeutic strategies that regulate or reverse aberrant DNA methylation patterns in hematological malignancies, including their combination with (chemo)immunotherapy.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Both autologous and allogeneic HCTs are associated with durable remission and prolonged survival when utilized in appropriate disease settings. Once remission has been achieved, consolidation with autologous HCT for APL patients with negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status, and with allogeneic HCT for APL patients with positive MRD status appear to offer the best long-term outcomes.

Recently, it has been shown that LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) is overexpressed in T-LBL but not in reactive immature TdT+ T cells in the thymus. On the basis of these findings, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of LMO2 by using immunohistochemistry and its role in differentiating iT-LBPs from T-LBLs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified cases of iT-LBP and T-LBL from the pathology archives of four institutions. Seven iT-LBP cases (including five new cases that have not been reported in the literature) and 13 T-LBL cases were analysed. Clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular data were analysed. Immunohistochemical staining with LMO2 was performed on all iT-LBP and T-LBL cases. A review of five new iT-LBP cases showed similar morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular features to those of previously reported cases. All iT-LBP cases were negative for LMO2 (0/7), whereas 92% of T-LBL cases (12/13) expressed LMO2; the sensitivity was 92% (confidence interval 64-100%) and the specificity was 100% (confidence interval 59-100%). CONCLUSION: We confirm previously published findings that iT-LBP cases show highly overlapping morphological and immunophenotypic features with T-LBL.

We report our experience with the diagnosis of suspicious for malignancy (SFM) in pleural effusion. METHODS: A search for pleural effusions diagnosed as SFM (2008-2018) was performed. Patient records and pathology reports were reviewed. Specimens were subdivided into groups depending on volume (<75, 75-400, >400 mL). Diagnoses of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) served as controls. RESULTS: We identified 90 patients, with a mean age of 60.6 years. Diagnoses included suspicious for involvement by carcinoma/adenocarcinoma in 64.4%, leukemia/lymphoma in 15.6%, melanoma in 2.2%, sarcoma in 3.3%, germ cell tumor in 1.1%, and not otherwise specified in 13.3%. Immunostains were performed in 47.8% and considered inconclusive in 24%. Average sample volume was 419 mL. There was a statistically significant difference between the SFM vs MPE groups for volumes greater than 75 mL (P = .001, chi 2 test), with SFM having increased proportion of volumes greater than 400 mL, compared with the MPE group. There was no statistically significant difference in mean overall survival when the groups were compared (P = .49).

Forming one arm of the host defense armory are cell autonomous restriction factors like Fv1. Originally described as protecting laboratory mice from infection by murine leukemia virus (MLV), Fv1s from some wild mice have also been found to restrict non-MLV retroviruses, suggesting an important role in the protection against viruses in nature. We surveyed the Fv1 genes of wild mice trapped in Thailand and characterized their restriction activities against a panel of retroviruses. An extra copy of the Fv1 gene, named Fv7, was found on chromosome 6 of three closely related Asian species of mice: Mus caroli, M. cervicolor, and M. cookii. The presence of flanking repeats suggested it arose by LINE-mediated retroduplication within their most recent common ancestor. A high degree of natural variation was observed in both Fv1 and Fv7 and, on top of positive selection at certain residues, insertions and deletions were present that changed the length of the reading frames. These genes exhibited a range of restriction phenotypes, with activities directed against gamma-, spuma-, and lentiviruses. It seems likely, at least in the case of M. caroli, that the observed gene duplication may expand the breadth of restriction beyond the capacity of Fv1 alone and that one or more such viruses have recently driven or continue to drive the evolution of the Fv1 and Fv7 genes.",,"['Yap, Melvyn W', 'Young, George R', 'Varnaite, Renata', 'Morand, Serge', 'Stoye, Jonathan P']","['Yap MW', 'Young GR', 'Varnaite R', 'Morand S', 'Stoye JP']","['The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement Animal et Gestion Integree des Risques, Faculty of Veterinary Technology, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200611,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,PMC7313476,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/06/12 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1008471 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-19-01683 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2020 Jun 11;16(6):e1008471. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1008471. eCollection 2020 Jun.,"['FC010162/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'FC010162/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '108012/Z/15/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'FC010162/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",6,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2248-6430', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1203-588X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9391-9291', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3986-7659', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3377-323X']",20200817,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Resistance/genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', '*Gene Duplication', 'Mice/*genetics/virology', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology/virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The effects of Brequinar Sodium (BQR) and 4SC-101 on lymphoblastoid cell lines were investigated. METHODS: DHODH expression and cell proliferation inhibition of lymphoblastoid and lymphoma cell lines were analyzed using Western blot analysis and XTT assay, respectively. JC-1 probe and ATP biochemiluminescence kit were used to evaluate the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation in these cell lines. Furthermore, we explored the cell cycle progression using Muse Cell Cycle Kit. RESULTS: Ramos, SUDHL-1 and RPMI-1788 cells are fast-growing cells with equal expression of DHODH enzyme and sensitivity to DHODH inhibitors that showed that the inhibition of DHODH was not cancer-specific. In ATP depletion assay, the non-cancerous RPMI-1788 cells showed only a minor ATP reduction compared to Ramos and SUDHL-1 (cancer) cells. In the mechanistic impact of DHODH inhibitors on non-cancerous vs cancerous cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay revealed that significant depolarization and cytochrome c release occurred with DHODH inhibitors treatment in Ramos but not in the RPMI-1788 cells, indicating a different mechanism of proliferation inhibition in normal cells. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide evidence that DHODH inhibitors perturb the proliferation of non-cancerous cells via a distinct mechanism compared to cancerous cells. These results may lead to strategies for overcoming the impact on non-cancerous cells during treatment with DHODH inhibitors, leading to a better therapeutic window in patients.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Kadir, Mohamad F A', 'Othman, Shatrah', 'Nellore, Kavitha']","['Kadir MFA', 'Othman S', 'Nellore K']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Pte Ltd, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,,['NOTNLM'],"['4SC-101', 'ATP depletion', 'Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase', 'S-phase arrest', 'brequinar sodium', 'lymphoma', 'mitochondrial membrane potential']",,2020/06/12 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPB-EPUB-107270 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201021666200611113734 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2020;21(15):1654-1665. doi: 10.2174/1389201021666200611113734.,,15,,20210107,"['0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Dicarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase)', '5XL19F49H6 (brequinar)', '8Y1PJ3VG81 (vidofludimus)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)']",IM,"['Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dicarboxylic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of inpatient location of treatment throughout therapy on long-term survival, complications, and cost-associations that have not yet been evaluated at the population level. METHODS: Using the California Cancer Registry linked to a hospitalization database, we identified patients, 0-39 years of age, diagnosed with first primary ALL who received inpatient treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or part or none of their inpatient treatment at an SCC within 3 years of diagnosis. Inverse probability-weighted, multivariable Cox regression models estimated the associations between location of treatment and sociodemographic and clinical factors with survival. We compared 3-year inpatient costs overall and per day by age group and location of care. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent (0-18 years; n = 4,549) of children and 36% of YAs (19-39 years; n = 683) received all treatment at SCCs. Receiving all treatment at an SCC was associated with superior leukemia-specific (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88) and overall survival (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) in children and in YAs (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.83; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.80) even after controlling for complications. The cost of inpatient care during the full course of therapy was higher in patients receiving all of their care at SCCs. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that inpatient treatment at an SCC throughout therapy is associated with superior survival; therefore, strong consideration should be given to referring these patients to SCCs.",,"['Alvarez, Elysia M', 'Malogolowkin, Marcio', 'Hoch, Jeffrey S', 'Li, Qian', 'Brunson, Ann', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Muffly, Lori', 'Wun, Ted', 'Keegan, Theresa H M']","['Alvarez EM', 'Malogolowkin M', 'Hoch JS', 'Li Q', 'Brunson A', 'Pollock BH', 'Muffly L', 'Wun T', 'Keegan THM']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Division of Health Policy and Management, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training and Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training and Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Division of Health Policy and Management, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Division of Bone Marrow and Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training and Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'University of California Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center, Sacramento, CA.', 'Division of Health Policy and Management, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training and Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200611,United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,PMC8189609,,,,2020/06/12 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JOP.19.00572 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Oncol Pract. 2020 Oct;16(10):e1120-e1133. doi: 10.1200/JOP.19.00572.

OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate the total costs associated with tisagenlecleucel treatment, including costs from pre- to postinfusion periods of tisagenlecleucel in addition to the cost of tisagenlecleucel. METHODS: An economic model was developed to estimate total costs associated with tisagenlecleucel treatment from the time of leukapheresis to 2 months postinfusion from a U.S. hospital's perspective. Costs were estimated based on resource use and safety management from the ELIANA trial and were considered during the pretreatment, tisagenlecleucel infusion, and follow-up periods of treatment. Cost components included leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, tisagenlecleucel infusion and hospital administration, inpatient and intensive care unit admissions, medical professional visits, laboratory tests and procedures, and management of major adverse events. Scenario analyses were conducted by varying key assumptions related to adverse events and hospitalization. RESULTS: The total cost associated with tisagenlecleucel treatment among pediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL was estimated to be $612,779, of which $137,636 (22.5%) was in addition to the list price of tisagenlecleucel ($475,000) and the associated administration cost of $143.08. The top 3 drivers of the additional cost were adverse event management ($70,968; 51.6%), inpatient and intensive care unit admissions not attributed to adverse events ($57,952; 42.1%), and laboratory tests and procedures ($5,209; 3.8%). The costs incurred during the pretreatment, infusion, and follow-up periods were $29,002, $476,659, and $107,118, respectively. In the scenario analyses, the total costs ranged from $483,169 (tisagenlecleucel treatment in the outpatient setting without adverse events) to $672,373 (tisagenlecleucel treatment in the inpatient setting with grade 3/4 cytokine release syndrome and B-cell aplasia). CONCLUSIONS: In this economic model, tisagenlecleucel treatment among pediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL was estimated to cost $612,779. The cost of care in addition to the price of tisagenlecleucel accounted for 22.5% of the total, with adverse event management and inpatient and intensive care unit admissions being main drivers. Further studies are warranted to assess the cost of tisagenlecleucel treatment in the context of current standards of care in real-world clinical practice.

Tetrandrine is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from traditional herb Fangji. According to our previous report, tetrandrine potentiated glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics partially via inhibiting P-glycoprotein function. In the present study, we investigated whether glucocorticoid receptor translocation was influenced indirectly by tetrandrine via P-glycoprotein inhibition, using human T lymphoblastoid leukemia MOLT-4 cell line with little P-glycoprotein expression and its multidrug resistant sub-line MOLT-4/DNR exhibiting a large amount of P-glycoprotein. Molecular mechanism investigation suggested that overexpressed P-glycoprotein weakened the glucocorticoid receptor translocation in MOLT-4/DNR cells comparing with the parent MOLT-4 cells. Our data also suggested that tetrandrine enhanced nuclear glucocorticoid receptor translocation in MOLT-4/DNR cells indirectly by dual influences on P-glycoprotein, inhibiting the efflux function and downregulating the protein expression. Therefore, tetrandrine potentiated the cytotoxic effect of methylprednisolone against MOLT-4/DNR cells with less effects on MOLT-4 cells. These effects of tetrandrine were suggested to be beneficial for the treatment of glucocorticoid resistant diseases induced by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, medication adherence is vital for patients on chronic treatment. Objective The objective of the current study was to evaluate response to treatment, adherence by patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and factors associated with adherence and response. Setting A haematology clinic in a regional referral hospital in Malaysia. Method Patients aged >/= 13 years who had been on imatinib or nilotinib for >/= 12 months were included in this cross-sectional study. An optimal response was defined as the achievement of major molecular response at 12 months of treatment. Patient medication adherence was determined using the average medication possession ratio based on the dispensing records. The patients were considered adherent if the medication possession ratio was > 90%. Multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate the factors associated with adherence. The association of adherence with molecular response was analysed by univariate logistic regression. Main outcome measure The primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients who achieved optimal response and the medication possession ratio. Results A total of 151 patients were screened, and 71 patients were included. Twenty-eight patients (39%) achieved major molecular response at 12 months of treatment. The median time to achieve this was 15.5 months (an interquartile range of 15). The mean medication possession ratio for imatinib and nilotinib was 0.94 (+/- 0.14) and 0.96 (+/- 0.10), respectively, but this difference was without statistical significance (t = - 0.517, p = 0.610). Nausea and vomiting (odds ratio [OR] of 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-0.83, p = 0.023) and disease phase at diagnosis (OR of 0.20, 95% CI 0.04-1.06, p = 0.059) were associated with patient adherence. An association was not found between patient adherence and molecular response (OR of 1.03, 95% CI 0.35-3.09, p = 0.956). Conclusion The patients in this study demonstrated a relatively deep molecular response and optimal adherence. Nevertheless, one fourth of them were noncompliant with imatinib.

Mounting evidence has implicated abnormal activation of some protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in IgAN. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IgAN provided insight into disease pathobiology and genetics. A GWAS locus on chromosome 22q12 contains genes encoding leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M, interleukin (IL)-6-related cytokines implicated in mucosal immunity and inflammation. We have previously shown that IL-6 mediates overproduction of Gd-IgA1 through aberrant STAT3 activation. Here, we show that LIF enhanced production of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-secreting cells of patients with IgAN and provide initial analyses of LIF signaling. Methods: We characterized LIF signaling that is involved in the overproduction of Gd-IgA1, using IgA1-secreting cell lines derived from peripheral blood of patients with IgAN and healthy controls (HC). We used global PTK activity profiling, immunoblotting, lectin ELISA, and siRNA knock-down. Results: LIF stimulation did not significantly affect production of total IgA1 in IgA1-secreting cells from patients with IgAN or HC. However, LIF increased production of Gd-IgA1, but only in the cells from patients with IgAN. LIF stimulation enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 in IgA1-secreting cells from patients with IgAN to a higher degree than in the cells from HC. siRNA knock-down of STAT1 blocked LIF-mediated overproduction of Gd-IgA1. Unexpectedly, this abnormal phosphorylation of STAT1 in IgA1-secreting cells from patients with IgAN was not mediated by JAK, but rather involved activation of Src-family PTKs (SFKs). Conclusion: Abnormal LIF/STAT1 signaling represents another pathway potentially leading to overproduction of Gd-IgA1 in IgAN, providing possible explanation for the phenotype associated with chromosome 22q12 GWAS locus. Abnormal LIF/STAT1 signaling and the associated SFKs may represent potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets in IgAN.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by S.

But the association of wAIHA with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), a very rare lymphoproliferative disorder, has never been reported. A 71-year-old man was in his usual state of health until three years ago when he developed intermittent bouts of worsening anemia associated with mild peripheral blood lymphocytosis. He was diagnosed with wAIHA and steroid therapy was initiated, resulting in an improvement in the hemoglobin level of the patient. His lymphocyte count remained persistently elevated but he did not develop any malignancy-related signs or symptoms. A diagnosis of 'indolent' T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (small cell variant) was made by combining distinctive clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analysis. His wAIHA went into complete remission and steroid therapy was successfully tapered off. He has not required any treatment for his T-PLL during the last two years' follow-up.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Yahya et al.']","['Yahya, Hafiz A', 'Khan, Nadia', 'Barta, Stefan', 'Nejati, Reza']","['Yahya HA', 'Khan N', 'Barta S', 'Nejati R']","['Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University Health System, Philadelphia, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.', 'Pathology/Hematopathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200506,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC7274264,['NOTNLM'],"['autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'indolent', 'rare', 't-cell prolymphocytic leukemia']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/06/12 06:00,2020/06/12 06:01,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.7994 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 May 6;12(5):e7994. doi: 10.7759/cureus.7994.,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether IL-6 knockdown in CART-19 cells can reduce IL-6 secretion from monocytes, which may reduce the risk of adverse events. Methods: Supernatants from cocultures of regular CART-19 cells and B lymphoma cells were added to monocytes in vitro, and the IL-6 levels in monocyte supernatants were measured 24 h later. IL-6 expression was knocked down in regular CART-19 cells by adding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (termed ssCART-19) expression cassette specific for IL-6 to the conventional CAR vector. Transduction efficiency and cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry, and cytotoxicity was measured by evaluating the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium. Gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR and RNA sequencing. A xenograft leukemia mouse model was established by injecting NOD/SCID/gammac-/- mice with luciferase-expressing B lymphoma cells, and then the animals were treated with regular CART-19 cells or ssCART-19. Tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence imaging. Results: Both recombinant IL-6 and CART-19 derived IL-6 significantly triggered IL-6 release by monocytes. IL-6 knockdown in ssCART-19 cells dramatically reduced IL-6 release from monocytes in vitro stduy. In vivo study further demonstrated that the mice bearing Raji cells treated with ssCART-19 cells showed significant lower IL-6 levels in serum than those treated with regular CART-19 cells, but comparable anti-tumor efficacy between the animal groups. Conclusion: CAR T-derived IL-6 is one of the most important initiators to amplify release of IL-6 from monocytes that further drive sCRS development. IL-6 knockdown in ssCART-19 cells by shRNA technology provide a promising strategy to improve the safety of CAR T cell therapy.",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],"['Kang, Liqing', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Zhang,

The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with tisagenlecleucel is a cost-effective intervention compared with salvage chemotherapy in paediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL in Spain. Materials and Methods: A partitioned survival model of monthly cycles with three health states was used (event-free survival, progressive/relapsed disease and death). A lifetime time horizon and the Spanish National Health System perspective were adopted. During the first 5 years, permanence in the different health states was determined according to the results in the clinical studies. In successive years, mortality tables of the Spanish general population adjusted by standardized mortality rate for survivors of childhood cancer were used. Clinical, economic, and quality of life parameters were drawn from clinical trials and the literature. Only direct health costs (pharmacological costs and the costs derived from health resource use) were included. The robustness of the results was evaluated in a sensitivity analysis. Results: This cost-effectiveness analysis showed a greater benefit (10.10 and 8.97 life-years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] gained, respectively) and a higher cost (euro 258,378.40) for tisagenlecleucel compared to salvage chemotherapy. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were euro 25,576.80 per LYG and euro 28,818.52 per QALY gained, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis, all the results were below euro 50,000/QALY.

Here we present an approach to uncover the efficacy of drug combinations based on the analysis of mono-drug effects. For this we used dose-response data from pharmacogenomic encyclopedias and represent these as a drug atlas. The drug atlas represents the relations between drug effects and allows to identify independent processes for which the tumor might be particularly vulnerable when attacked by two drugs. Our approach enables the prediction of combination-therapy which can be linked to tumor-driving mutations. By using this strategy, we can uncover potential effective drug combinations on a pan-cancer scale. Predicted synergies are provided and have been validated in glioblastoma, breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia mouse-models, resulting in therapeutic synergy in 75% of the tested models. This indicates that we can accurately predict effective drug combinations with translational value.",,"['Narayan, Ravi S', 'Molenaar, Piet', 'Teng, Jian', 'Cornelissen, Fleur M G', 'Roelofs, Irene',

32522979,NLM,MEDLINE,20211204,2041-4889 (Electronic),11,2020 Jun 10,SHQ1 is an ER stress response gene that facilitates chemotherapeutics-induced apoptosis via sensitizing ER-stress response.,445,10.1038/s41419-020-2656-0 [doi],"SHQ1 was reported to control the biogenesis and assembly of H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). It was independently isolated as a growth suppressor, GRIM1, in a genetic screen. Recent studies have indicated that SHQ1 inhibits prostate cancer growth and metastasis. SHQ1 facilitates MYC RNA splicing to promote T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development. Thus, the mechanisms of SHQ1 in cancers remain largely unknown. We report here that SHQ1 promotes tumor apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In HCC tissues from patients, expression of SHQ1 was significantly decreased in the tumor compared to adjacent tissues. Experiments with HCC xenograft models revealed that restoring SHQ1 levels enhanced the anti-tumor activity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer tunicamycin (TM) and common chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (PTX). Mechanistically, SHQ1 is an ER-stress response gene which is regulated by p50ATF6 and XBP1s through an ER stress response like element located on the SHQ1 promoter. SHQ1 interacts with the ER chaperone GRP78 to release ER sensors PERK/IRE1alpha/ATF6 from GRP78/ER-sensor complexes, leading to hyper-activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). In the persistent ER stress conditions of a HepG2 xenograft tumor model, SHQ1-mediated hyper-activation of ER-sensor signaling induces apoptosis. Our study thus demonstrates a SHQ1-mediated ER-stress response feedback loop that promotes tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutics.",,"['Liu, Huimin', 'Xie, Siqi', 'Fang, Fang', 'Kalvakolanu, Dhananjaya V', 'Xiao, Weihua']","['Liu H', 'Xie S', 'Fang F', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Xiao W']","['Department of Oncology of the First Affiliated Hospital, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Biotechnology Drugs Anhui, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Oncology of the First Affiliated Hospital, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Biotechnology Drugs Anhui, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Oncology of the First Affiliated Hospital, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China. fangfang@mail.ustc.edu.cn.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. fangfang@mail.ustc.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. fangfang@mail.ustc.edu.cn.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Biotechnology Drugs Anhui, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China. fangfang@mail.ustc.edu.cn.', 'Department of Microbiology and Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA. dkalvako@som.umaryland.edu.', 'Department of Oncology of the First Affiliated Hospital, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China. xiaow@ustc.edu.cn.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. xiaow@ustc.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. xiaow@ustc.edu.cn.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Biotechnology Drugs Anhui, University of Science and Technology of China, 230027, Anhui, Hefei, China. xiaow@ustc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200610,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC7286909,,,,2020/06/12 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2656-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2656-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jun 10;11(6):445. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2656-0.,,6,,20210319,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (SHQ1 protein, human)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Biological', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) ligand has been shown to play a role in cancer, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. Once bound to ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), CLCF1 mediates interactions to coreceptors glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). By increasing CNTFR-mediated binding to these coreceptors we generated a receptor superagonist which surpassed the potency of natural CNTFR ligands in neuronal signaling. Through additional mutations, we generated a receptor antagonist with increased binding to CNTFR but lack of binding to the coreceptors that inhibited tumor progression in murine xenograft models of nonsmall cell lung cancer.

It is not clear whether there is an association between GI microflora changes and hematological malignancies. METHODS: In the current study, we used 16S rDNA gene sequencing techniques to profile the GI microbiome in children with lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 18) and matched healthy control (n = 18). Using multiple specialized software [Heatmap, Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), Claster and Metastates], we analyzed the sequencing data for microfloral species classification, abundance and diversity. RESULTS: A total of 27 genera between the ALL and control groups (FDR </= 0.05 and/or P </= 0.05) showed significantly different abundance between ALL patients and healthy controls: 12 of them were predominant in healthy group and other 15 species were significantly higher in ALL group. In addition, we compared the abundance and diversity of microfloral species in ALL patients prior to and during remission stage after chemotherapy, and no significant difference was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to healthy controls, ALL patient showed significant changes of GI microfloras. Further explorations of the intestinal micro-ecology in ALL patients may provide important information to understand relationship between microfloras and ALL.",,"['Gao, Xiaolin', 'Miao, Ruixue', 'Zhu, Yiping', 'Lin, Chao', 'Yang, Xue', 'Jia, Ruizhen', 'Linghan, Kuang', 'Wan, Chaomin', 'Deng, Jianjun']","['Gao X', 'Miao R', 'Zhu Y', 'Lin C', 'Yang X', 'Jia R', 'Linghan K', 'Wan C', 'Deng J']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China."", ""Open Laboratory, West China Institute for Women's and Children's Health, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China."", 'Group of bacterial biology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan university west China second hospital, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics, Western Women's and Children's Research Institute, West China University Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Number 20, 3rd Section, People's South Road, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan Province, China. hxekbgs@163.com."", 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China. hxekbgs@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200610,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,PMC7646195,['NOTNLM'],"['*16S rDNA sequencing', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Children', '*Intestinal microfloras']",,2020/06/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12887-020-02192-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12887-020-02192-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2020 Jun 10;20(1):290. doi: 10.1186/s12887-020-02192-9.,,1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6284-0852'],20210514,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of the present research work was directed towards studying the anticancer effects of scutellarin-a plant flavone, against K562 human leukemia cells, along with examining its effects on cellular apoptosis, cell cycle, cell migration and cell invasion as well as Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. METHODS: Cell viability of K562 leukemia cells was evaluated by WTS-1 assay, while apoptotic effects induced by scutellarin in K562 cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and western blot methods. Effects on cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. Transwell Matrigel assay was performed to evaluate whether scutellarin induces inhibition of cell migration and cell invasion effects in K562 cells. RESULTS: Scutellarin was shown to suppress the viability of the K562 cells dose-dependently with an IC50 of 6 muM. Further, scutellarin was shown to induce apoptosis which was initially exhibited by DAPI and annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and then confirmed by western blot in which it was shown to trigger regulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 in K562 human leukemia cells. Scutellarin also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest which was accompanied by suppression of cell migration and invasion. Scutellarin also led to the decline of the expression of p-Raf, p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, scutellarin could inhibit the growth of K562 human leukemia cells by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cell migration and invasion and downregulating the expressions of p-Raf, p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2.",,"['Bao, Jing', 'Xia, Liang', 'Zhao, Yucheng', 'Xia, Ruixiang']","['Bao J', 'Xia L', 'Zhao Y', 'Xia R']","['Department of Hematology, the first affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,,2020/06/12 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/06/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2020 Mar-Apr;25(2):1050-1055.,,2,,20210208,"['0 (Glucuronates)', '16IGP0ML9A (scutellarin)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)']",IM,"['Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Glucuronates/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'raf Kinases/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We searched comprehensive electronic databases from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library to identify studies evaluating the association between radon and leukemia. RESULTS: Ten eligible studies published from 1995 to 2014 were enrolled. Of these 10 studies, 8 were case-control studies (involving 10803 cases and 16202 controls) and 2 were cohort studies (involving 1,428 cases). Overall results as odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for case-control studies and fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with corresponding 95%CI for cohort studies were identified. A positive but weak association was found between radon exposure and childhood leukemia in case-control studies (summary OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.01-1.42) rather than cohort studies (summary HR 0.97, 95%CI 0.81-1.15).

The name ""arsenikon,"" meaning ""potent,"" speaks itself for the pharmaceutical properties of this compound, questioned and analyzed for at least 2000 years. In the last decades, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has evolved from a highly fatal to a curable disease, due to the use of all-trans-retinoic acid and, more recently, arsenic trioxide combinations. The success of these entirely chemo-free regimens increased the awareness of APL and reduced the prevalence of early deaths, which was an impending issue in this disease. Further improvements are expected with the next use of oral arsenic formulations, which will allow a complete outpatient approach, at least in the post-induction settings, further improving patients' quality of life. The wide use of standardized approaches in APL will also help unravel long-standing open questions, including the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of the differentiation syndrome and of short-term organ toxicities. In the long term, the study of survivorship issues, such as fertility and organ-related and psychological damages, in the increasing number of survivors will help further improve their life after APL.","['(c) 2020 S.

METHODS: All neoplasms in patients younger than 18 years, diagnosed between 1990 and 2017 (N = 15,233), were derived from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Incidence rates and the average annual percentage change with 95% CIs were calculated for all cancers combined and diagnostic (sub)groups. The stability of trends was examined by joinpoint analyses. Potential changes in early detection or improved staging over time were evaluated through proportional alterations in stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: The annual overall cancer incidence increased significantly over time by 0.6% (95% CI 0.3-0.8) from 144 per million person-years in 1990-1999 to 162 in 2010-2017 and was significant for both boys (+0.5%, 0.2-0.8) and girls (+0.7%, 0.3-1.1), for infants (aged 0 years; +1.5%, 0.4-2.5), teenagers (aged 10-14 years; +0.6%, 0.3-1.0) and young adolescents (aged 15-17 years; +0.7%, 0.2-1.2), with no trend interruptions. The incidence of leukaemia (+0.7%, 0.3-1.2), malignant CNS tumours including pilocytic astrocytomas (+1.0%, 0.5-1.5), neuroblastoma (+1.2%, 0.1-2.2) and Ewing bone tumours (+2.4%, 0.9-4.0) increased significantly, whereas temporal variation in trends was observed in boys diagnosed with leukaemia, in pilocytic astrocytoma and malignant melanoma. The proportion of early-stage disease increased in patients with testicular germ cell tumours (+21%) and malignant melanomas (+14%), whereas stage migration towards advanced disease was seen for Hodgkin lymphomas, soft tissue sarcomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas. CONCLUSION: The increasing childhood cancer incidence could not be explained by a rise in early diagnosis, which suggests that background risk factors seem of more importance.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Camidanlumab tesirine is an antibody-drug conjugate against CD25, an antigen expressed in several malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This open-label, dose-escalation and -expansion study (NCT02588092) assessed the safety, activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of camidanlumab tesirine in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL/AML. A total of 35 patients (34 AML and 1 ALL) were enrolled and received camidanlumab tesirine intravenously at 3-92 mug/kg once every three weeks (Q3W, n = 26) or 30 or 37.5 mug/kg every week (QW, n = 9). One dose-limiting toxicity of maculopapular rash occurred in the 30 mug/kg QW group; the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. No additional safety concerns or adverse events (AEs) of interest were identified. The most common (>10 % of patients) Grade >/=3 treatment-emergent AEs were febrile neutropenia (25.7 %), lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or fatigue (all 14.3 %), pneumonia, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, and hypophosphatemia (each 11.4 %). No signal for serious immune-related AEs such as Guillain-Barre syndrome/polyradiculopathy was observed and there was no evidence of immunogenicity. PK showed rapid clearance with apparent half-life <2 days for conjugated and total antibody, suggesting that Q3W dosing may be insufficient for therapeutic efficacy, and prompting exploration of a QW schedule. Two patients achieved complete responses with incomplete hematologic recovery; one each at 30 and 37.5 mug/kg QW.

Recent data suggest that these individuals are also at an elevated risk of certain complications post-ASCT. This risk may result from preexisting HIV-related factors affecting dynamics of immune reconstitution post-ASCT. However, to date, there has been little work describing the dynamics of immune reconstitution post-ASCT in persons with HIV and none comparing these data to controls without HIV. METHODS: We assessed T-cell reconstitution in 6 ASCT with HIV recipients (HIV+ASCT) compared to a control population of 21 ASCT without HIV recipients. In a subset of HIV+ASCT recipients we performed additional flow cytometry profiling of CD8+ T-cell subsets and antigen specificity of reconstituting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. RESULTS: We observe no difference in post-ASCT CD4+ T cells between HIV+ASCT and HIV-negative ASCT recipients, despite much lower pre-ASCT CD4+ T-cell counts in the HIV+ASCT group. In contrast, we observed significantly higher CD8+ T-cell numbers in the HIV+ASCT group post-ASCT. The reconstituting CD8+ T-cells were predominantly CD45RO+, whereas homing markers and antigen specificity of these cells varied between participants. CONCLUSION: This study represents the most extensive characterization of immune-reconstitution post-ASCT in persons with HIV, and the first to our knowledge to compare these data to ASCT controls without HIV.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains the most frequent cause of non-relapse mortality following allo-HCT and limits its extensive clinical application. Current pharmacologic agents used for prophylaxis and treatment of aGvHD are not uniformly successful and have serious secondary side effects. Therefore, more effective and safe prophylaxis and therapy for aGvHD are an unmet clinical need. Defibrotide is a multi-target drug successfully employed for prophylaxis and treatment of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Recent preliminary clinical data have suggested some efficacy of defibrotide in the prevention of aGvHD after allo-HCT. Using a fully MHC-mismatched murine model of allo-HCT, we report here that defibrotide, either in prophylaxis or treatment, is effective in preventing T cell and neutrophil infiltration and aGvHD-associated tissue injury, thus reducing aGvHD incidence and severity, with significantly improved survival after allo-HCT. Moreover, we performed in vitro mechanistic studies using human cells revealing that defibrotide inhibits leucocyte-endothelial interactions by down-regulating expression of key endothelial adhesion molecules involved in leucocyte trafficking. Together, these findings provide evidence that defibrotide may represent an effective and safe clinical alternative for both prophylaxis and treatment of aGvHD after allo-HCT, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Then, overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared between patients with high vs. low AK1 expression. In the chemotherapy group, high AK1 expression was favorable for both EFS (P=0.016) and OS (P=0.014). In the allo-HSCT group, there was no association for AK1 expression levels and clinical outcomes. Further analyses suggested that in the high AK1 expression group, EFS and OS were longer in patients treated with allo-HSCT compared with those treated with chemotherapy (P=0.0011; P<0.0001, respectively), whereas no significant differences were observed in the low AK1 expression group. In summary, we reported AK1 as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor of AML patients undergoing chemotherapy, and its use could also facilitate clinical decision-making in selecting treatment for AML patients.

Although various types of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) have been explored, quantities of lncRNAs still wait to be exploited. The present study is to probe the functions and mechanism of lncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) in PCa. In the present study, we discovered that HOXA-AS2 was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. HOXA-AS2 depletion obviously influenced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. In addition, miR-509-3p had low expression in PCa cells and inversely modulated by HOXA-AS2. Cutting down HOXA-AS2 expression was capable of up-regulating miR-509-3p expression. In addition, HOXA-AS2 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) through sponging miR-509-3p to release pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) expression. The expression of PBX3 was noticeably high in tumor tissues. And PBX3 expression level was down-regulated markedly with the knockdown of HOXA-AS2. Rescue experiments certified the facilitated role of HOXA-AS2-miR-509-3p-PBX3 axis in regulating the progress of PCa.

We therefore transformed MFC raw data into a multicolor 2D image by a self-organizing map and classified this representation using a convolutional neural network. By this means, we built an artificial intelligence that is not only able to distinguish diseased from healthy samples, but it can also differentiate seven subtypes of mature B-cell neoplasm. We trained our model with 18,274 cases including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its precursor monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.94 on a separate test set of 2,348 cases. Furthermore, we estimated the trustworthiness of a classification and could classify 70% of all cases with a confidence of 0.95 and higher. Our performance analyses indicate that particularly for rare subtypes further improvement can be expected when even more samples are available for training. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Venetoclax is a highly selective BCL-2 inhibitor that has been approved by the FDA for treating elderly AML patients. However, the emergence of resistance after long-term treatment emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the potential mechanisms of resistance and effective rescue methods. By using RNA-seq analysis in two human AML cohorts made up of three patients with complete remission and three patients without remission after venetoclax treatment, we identified that upregulation of BTK enabled AML blast resistance to venetoclax. Interestingly, we found that abivertinib, an oral BTK inhibitor, could synergize with venetoclax to inhibit the proliferation of primary AML cells and cell lines. It is worth noting that the combination of the two effectively enhanced the sensitivity of two AML patients (AML#3 and AML#12) to venetoclax. In this study, we demonstrated that combined use of the two drugs can synergistically inhibit the colony-forming capacity of AML cells, arrest the AML cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and inhibit the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic family protein, activating the caspase family to induce apoptosis. Mechanistically, knockdown of BTK in AML cell lines impaired the synergistic effect of the two drugs. In vivo study showed similar results as those seen in vitro. Abivertinib in combination with venetoclax could significantly prolong the survival time and reduce the tumor burden of MV4-11-NSG mice compared with those of control and single-agent groups. Our in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the combination of abivertinib and venetoclax may benefit AML patients, especially in patients resistant to venetoclax or those that relapse.

The specific recognition is abolished by C1188D mutation, which also prevents MLL-related leukemia. In this paper, multiple molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the mechanism of recognition and influences of C1188D mutation. Started from fully dissociated DNA and MLL1-CXXC domain, remarkably, the center of mass (COM) of MLL1-CXXC domain quickly concentrates on the vicinity of the CpG site in all 53 short MD simulations. Extended simulations of the wild type showed that the native complex formed in 500 ns among 4 of 53 simulations. In contrast, the C1188D mutant COM distributed broadly around the DNA and the native complex was not observed in any of the extended simulations. Simulations on the apo MLL1-CXXC domain further suggest that the wild type protein remained predominantly in an open form that closely resembles its structure in the native complex whereas C1188D mutant formed predominantly compact structures in which the N- terminal bends to D1188. This conformational switch hinders the formation of encounter complex, thus abolishes the recognition.

In this study, 128 patients with RS, including 112 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-type RS, 15 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)-type RS, and one plasmablastic lymphoma, were identified in 11 centres of the Spanish CLL Study Group (GELLC). The median overall survival (OS) was 5.9 months for DLBCL-type RS and 30.8 months for HL-type RS. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, haemoglobin level, platelet count, serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta2-microglobulin levels, tumour protein p53 (TP53) abnormalities in the CLL clone concomitant to RS, number of prior therapies, and clonal relationship between CLL and RS, were associated with OS in patients with DLBCL-type RS. A platelet count of <100 x 10(9) /l, prior CLL therapy (0 vs. >/=1), and presence of TP53 alterations maintained an independent prognostic impact in the multivariate analysis. Patients without any of these factors had a better clinical outcome, with a median OS of 75.3 months, while patients with one or two or more of these factors presented a median OS of 25.5 and 3 months, respectively.

The most commonly used agents, methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide (Cy) and cyclosporine primarily produce partial remissions (PRs), with few complete responses (CRs). We evaluated the clinical course and treatment response of 60 consecutive patients with T-LGLL to evaluate clinical outcomes and future potential treatment directions. Impaired overall survival was noted among male patients, patients with elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and those without rheumatoid arthritis. Cy was the most efficacious second-line agent, with a 70% overall response rate (ORR; three CR, four PR). All patients who failed frontline MTX responded to second-line Cy. In the relapsed or Cy-refractory setting, alemtuzumab (n = 4) and pentostatin (n = 3) had an ORR of 50% and 66%, respectively, while duvelisib induced a long-term response in one patient.

RECENT FINDINGS: Adipose tissue secrets a variety of adipocytokines, and expression and/or secretion rate of most of them seems to be increased or dysregulated in obesity. In addition, obesity leads to increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which promotes an infiltration of inflammatory immune cells into adipose tissue. This process may facilitate a state of ""subclinical inflammation"" (metaflammation) and may lead to the development of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), starting as early as during childhood. In addition, several oncogenes have been linked to inflammation and cancer development via different pathways, and several types of tumors need an inflammatory environment before a malignant change occurs. An inflammatory environment seems to promote the proliferation and survival of malignant cells as well as angiogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in this process, as they are able to kill transformed cells without prior sensitization and coordinate subsequent immune responses by producing distinct cytokines, thus providing antitumor immunity. First studies in children have suggested that NK cells from obese children are activated, metabolically stressed, and functionally deficient. This may lead to a suppression of antitumor immunity as early as during childhood, probably many years before the development of cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between higher body mass index (BMI) during childhood and adolescence and increased risk for several malignancies in adulthood, including leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, but several adipocytokines and inflammatory markers including NK cells seem to be ""key players"" in this process.",,"['Weihe, Paul', 'Spielmann, Julia', 'Kielstein, Heike', 'Henning-Klusmann, Jan', 'Weihrauch-Bluher, Susann']","['Weihe P', 'Spielmann J', 'Kielstein H', 'Henning-Klusmann J', 'Weihrauch-Bluher S']","['Clinic for Pediatrics I, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Ernst-Grube-Str. 40, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Medical Faculty of Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Medical Faculty of Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatrics I, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Ernst-Grube-Str. 40, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatrics I, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Ernst-Grube-Str. 40, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany. susann.weihrauch-blueher@uk-halle.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Obes Rep,Current obesity reports,101578283,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescence', 'Cancer risk', 'Childhood', 'Inflammatory markers', 'Metaflammation', 'NK cells', 'Obesity']",,2020/06/11 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13679-020-00387-w [doi]', '10.1007/s13679-020-00387-w [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Obes Rep. 2020 Sep;9(3):204-212. doi: 10.1007/s13679-020-00387-w.,,3,,20210604,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*immunology', 'Adiposity/immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Carcinogenesis/immunology', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*immunology', 'Pediatric Obesity/complications/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IBR has low oral bioavailability of 2.9% owing to its high first pass metabolism. Present study was aimed to develop the nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) using glyceryl monostearate (GMS) as solid lipid and Capryol PGMC as liquid lipid. Plackett-Burman design (PBD) was applied to screen the significant factors; furthermore, these significant factors were subjected to optimisation using Central Composite design (CCD). The size, poly dispersity index (PDI) and entrapment efficiency (E.E.) of the developed NLC were 106.4 +/- 8.66 nm, 0.272 +/- 0.005 and 70.54 +/- 5.52% respectively. Morphological evaluation using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) revealed spherical particles. Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates the formation of molecular dispersion of drug in the melted lipid matrix while Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) studies reveal the absence of crystalline drug peaks in the formulation diffractogram. In-vivo pharmacokinetics of NLC displayed an increase in Cmax (2.89-fold), AUC0-t (5.32-fold) and mean residence time (MRT) (1.82-fold) compared with free drug. Furthermore, lymphatic uptake was evaluated by chylomicron flow blocking approach using cycloheximide (CXI). The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and MRT of NLC without CXI were 2.75, 3.57 and 1.30 folds higher compared with NLC with CXI. The difference in PK parameters without CXI indicates significant lymphatic uptake of the formulation. Hence, NLC can be a promising approach to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs with high first-pass metabolism.

A liquid 6MP formulation was recently introduced to facilitate oral 6MP administration, especially to children. Its approval and bioequivalence with 6MP tablet were based on comparative pharmacokinetics in 60 healthy adults. Due to potential pharmacokinetic differences between healthy adults and children with ALL, we compared pharmacokinetics of tablet and liquid 6MP formulations in children with ALL. METHODS: Pharmacokinetics of 50 mg 6MP tablet (Puri-Nethol((R))) and 20 mg/ml 6MP liquid suspension (Xaluprine((R))) were compared in a non-blinded, random order, single-dose, cross-over study in 16 children with ALL (eight males). 6MP was administered after a 12 h fast, and 6MP plasma concentrations measured consecutively over seven hours post-dose. Pharmacokinetic outcomes were as follows: Area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), and terminal half-life (T(1/2)). RESULTS: Liquid 6MP formulation resulted in a 26% lower AUC (p = 0.02) compared with tablet (median 1215 vs. 1805 h x nmol/l). No significant differences were observed for Cmax,Tmax and T(1/2) (p = 0.28, p = 0.09, p = 0.41, respectively). Based on criteria declared by the World Health Organization the results did not establish non-inferiority of liquid 6MP formulation compared with 6MP tablet. CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority of liquid 6MP formulation compared with 6MP tablet was not demonstrated. Yet, maintenance therapy doses are adjusted by degree of myelosuppression and not by 6MP dose. Thus, in spite of a lower bioavailability, a liquid 6MP formulation is still desirable in a clinical setting, especially for children. However, if shifting between 6MP formulation is indicated, dose adjustments should be anticipated to maintain equivalent treatment intensity in children with ALL.

First-line ibrutinib was associated with an improvement of 0.26 QALYs and 0.40 life-years compared with using ibrutinib in the third-line setting. However, using ibrutinib in the first-line led to significantly higher health care costs (incremental cost of $612 700), resulting in an ICER of $2 350 041 per QALY. The monthly cost of ibrutinib would need to be decreased by 72% for first-line ibrutinib therapy to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY. In a scenario analysis where ibrutinib was used in the second-line in the delayed ibrutinib arm, first-line ibrutinib had an incremental cost of $478 823, an incremental effectiveness of 0.05 QALYs, and an ICER of $9 810 360 per QALY when compared with second-line use. These data suggest that first-line ibrutinib for unselected older adults with CLL is unlikely to be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying ibrutinib for most patients with CLL until later lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit health care costs without compromising clinical outcomes.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Patel, Kishan K', 'Isufi, Iris', 'Kothari, Shalin', 'Davidoff, Amy J', 'Gross, Cary P', 'Huntington, Scott F']","['Patel KK', 'Isufi I', 'Kothari S', 'Davidoff AJ', 'Gross CP', 'Huntington SF']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, New Haven, CT; and.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, New Haven, CT; and.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, New Haven, CT; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2020/06/11 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61618-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020004922 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Oct 22;136(17):1946-1955. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020004922.,,17,,20210324,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use', 'Aged', '*Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/economics/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Models, Economic', '*Neoadjuvant Therapy/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Palliative Care/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Piperidines/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Salvage Therapy/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,['Blood. 2020 Oct 22;136(17):1896-1898.

Despite numerous clinical studies, outcomes are consistently disappointing with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 10%. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation at the time of second complete remission remains the only reliable option with curative potential. However, recent approval of several new agents has transformed treatment paradigms that had been in place for almost half a century in AML. This new therapeutic landscape provides the opportunity to revisit the approach to relapsed or refractory AML. Through illustrative cases, we describe our approach, which increasingly relies on specific disease biology. We focus on treatment outside of the context of clinical trials because such trials are not available in most parts of the world. Primarily, we consider age, fitness to tolerate intensive chemotherapy, remission duration, and presence of a targetable mutation to guide treatment. The coming years will inevitably bring new targets and agents that may prove most effective when combined with each other and/or chemotherapy. Future studies are needed to determine how best to implement this evolving armamentarium of treatment options, to elucidate mechanisms of resistance, and to continue the pursuit of novel drug discovery.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['DeWolf, Susan', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['DeWolf S', 'Tallman MS']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC7453152,,,,2020/06/11 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61758-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001982 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Aug 27;136(9):1023-1032. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001982.,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",9,,20210317,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Autografts', '*Disease Management', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Patient Selection', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, multiple therapies, such as nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and, more recently, ponatinib, have made their way as viable treatment options for first-line and secondary therapies. Most patients tend to respond to first-line treatment. Although there is a subset of patients who do not achieve complete molecular response with first line, newer options have proven beneficial. As we progress through therapies, there still remain some patients who do not adequately respond to current available therapies. The treatment options and guidelines become more difficult in such situations, not only with respect to cost but also patient quality of life and satisfaction.

Mammalian genomes consist of many small functional domains termed topologically associated domains (TADs), many of them organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesion complex. Changes in genome TADs might result in inappropriate promoter/enhancer communications leading to activation of oncogenes or suppression of tumor suppressors. During normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, genome structure alters considerably to facilitate normal and malignant hematopoiesis, respectively. Delineating theses normal and abnormal processes will evolve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and development of potential treatment strategies. This review highlights the role of CTCF and its associated protein complexes in three-dimensional genome organization in development and leukemogenesis, as well as the roles of CTCF boundary defined TAD in transcription regulation. We further explore the function of chromatin modulators, such as CTCF, cohesin, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in chromosomal interactions and hematopoietic genome organization. Finally, we focus on the implication of 3D genome alteration in the pathogenesis of leukemia and provide a scientific basis for targeted intervention.",,"['Qiu, Yi', 'Huang, Suming']","['Qiu Y', 'Huang S']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 16033, USA. yqiu1@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 16033, USA. yqiu1@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 16033, USA. shuang4@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 16033, USA. shuang4@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200609,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC7596903,,,,2020/06/11 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0906-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0906-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Sep;34(9):2295-2304. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0906-x.

Utilizing SNP array (n = 486,941) and whole exome sequencing data (n = 49,956), we identified 1166 participants with myeloid CH, defined by myeloid-associated mosaic chromosome abnormalities (mCA) and/or likely somatic driver mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2, SRSF2, or PPM1D. Myeloid CH increased by 1.1-fold per annum (myeloid mCA, P = 1.57 x 10(-38); driver mutations, P = 5.89 x 10(-47)). Genome-wide association analysis identified two distinct signals within TERT that predisposed to myeloid CH, plus a weaker signal corresponding to the JAK2 46/1 haplotype. Specific subtypes of myeloid CH were associated with several blood features and clinical phenotypes, including TET2 mutations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking history was significantly associated with myeloid CH: 53% of myeloid CH cases were smokers compared to 44% of controls (P = 3.38 x 10(-6)), a difference principally due to current (OR = 1.10; P = 6.14 x 10(-6)) rather than past smoking (P = 0.08). Breakdown of CH by specific mutation type revealed that ASXL1 loss of function mutations were most strongly associated with current smoking status (OR = 1.07; P = 1.92 x 10(-5)), and the only abnormality associated with past smoking (OR = 1.04; P = 0.0026). We suggest that the inflammatory environment induced by smoking may promote the outgrowth of ASXL1-mutant clones.",,"['Dawoud, Ahmed A Z', 'Tapper, William J', 'Cross, Nicholas C P']","['Dawoud AAZ', 'Tapper WJ', 'Cross NCP']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. ncpc@soton.ac.uk.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, UK. ncpc@soton.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200610,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2020/06/11 06:00,2020/11/21 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0896-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0896-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Oct;34(10):2660-2672. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0896-8.

Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE) molecules, which redirect patient T cells to lyse tumor cells, are a clinically validated modality for hematologic malignancies. Due to broad AML expression and limited normal tissue expression, fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is proposed to be an optimal BiTE molecule target. Expression profiling of FLT3 was performed in primary AML patient samples and normal hematopoietic cells and nonhematopoietic tissues. Two novel FLT3 BiTE molecules, one with a half-life extending (HLE) Fc moiety and one without, were assessed for T-cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) of FLT3-positive cell lines in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo FLT3 protein was detected on the surface of most primary AML bulk and leukemic stem cells but only a fraction of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. FLT3 protein detected in nonhematopoietic cells was cytoplasmic. FLT3 BiTE molecules induced TDCC of FLT3-positive cells in vitro, reduced tumor growth and increased survival in AML mouse models in vivo Both molecules exhibited reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in cynomolgus monkeys in vivo, including elimination of FLT3-positive cells in blood and bone marrow. In ex vivo cultures of primary AML samples, patient T cells induced TDCC of FLT3-positive target cells. Combination with PD-1 blockade increased BiTE activity. These data support the clinical development of an FLT3 targeting BiTE molecule for the treatment of AML.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Brauchle, Bettina', 'Goldstein, Rebecca L', 'Karbowski, Christine M', 'Henn, Anja', 'Li, Chi-Ming', 'Bucklein, Veit L', 'Krupka, Christina', 'Boyle, Michael C', 'Koppikar, Priya', 'Haubner, Sascha', 'Wahl, Joachim', 'Dahlhoff, Christoph', 'Raum, Tobias', 'Rardin, Matthew J', 'Sastri, Christine', 'Rock, Dan A', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael', 'Frank, Brendon', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Case, Ryan', 'Friedrich, Matthias', 'Balazs, Mercedesz', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Coxon, Angela', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Arvedson, Tara']","['Brauchle B', 'Goldstein RL', 'Karbowski CM', 'Henn A', 'Li CM', 'Bucklein VL', 'Krupka C', 'Boyle MC', 'Koppikar P', 'Haubner S', 'Wahl J', 'Dahlhoff C', 'Raum T', 'Rardin MJ', 'Sastri C', 'Rock DA', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon M', 'Frank B', 'Metzeler KH', 'Case R', 'Friedrich M', 'Balazs M', 'Spiekermann K', 'Coxon A', 'Subklewe M', 'Arvedson T']","['Gene Center, Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Gene Center, Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Gene Center, Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California.', 'Gene Center, Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Gene Center, Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Gene Center, Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. taraa@amgen.com marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Amgen Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California. taraa@amgen.com marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200609,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,,,,2020/06/11 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-19-1093 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-1093 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2020 Sep;19(9):1875-1888. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-1093.
